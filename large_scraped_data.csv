**Like this project?**

You might also like my other Minecraft clone written in C using modern OpenGL (GL shader language). It performs better, has better terrain generation and saves state to a sqlite database. See here:

https://github.com/fogleman/Craft

## Goals and Vision

I would like to see this project turn into an educational tool. Kids love Minecraft and Python is a great first language.
This is a good opportunity to get children excited about programming.

The code should become well commented and more easily configurable. It should be easy to make some simple changes
and see the results quickly.

I think it would be great to turn the project into more of a library / API... a Python package that you import and then
use / configure to setup a world and run it. Something along these lines...


```python
import mc

world = mc.World(...)
world.set_block(x, y, z, mc.DIRT)
mc.run(world)
```

The API could contain functionality for the following:

- Easily configurable parameters like gravity, jump velocity, walking speed, etc.
- Hooks for terrain generation.

## How to Run

```shell
pip install pyglet
git clone https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft.git
cd Minecraft
python main.py
```

### Mac

On Mac OS X, you may have an issue with running Pyglet in 64-bit mode. Try running Python in 32-bit mode first:

```shell
arch -i386 python main.py
```

If that doesn't work, set Python to run in 32-bit mode by default:

```shell
defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes 
```

This assumes you are using the OS X default Python.  Works on Lion 10.7 with the default Python 2.7, and may work on other versions too.  Please raise an issue if not.
    
Or try Pyglet 1.2 alpha, which supports 64-bit mode:  

```shell
pip install https://pyglet.googlecode.com/files/pyglet-1.2alpha1.tar.gz 
```

### If you don't have pip or git

For pip:

- Mac or Linux: install with `sudo easy_install pip` (Mac or Linux) - or (Linux) find a package called something like 'python-pip' in your package manager.
- Windows: [install Distribute then Pip](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12476379/992887) using the linked .MSI installers.

For git:

- Mac: install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) first, then `brew install git`.
- Windows or Linux: see [Installing Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) from the _Pro Git_ book.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft/wiki) for this project to install Python, and other tips.

This docker image provides a Minecraft Server that will automatically download the latest stable
version at startup. You can also run/upgrade to any specific version or the
latest snapshot. See the _Versions_ section below for more information.

To simply use the latest stable version, run

    docker run -d -it -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE itzg/minecraft-server

where, in this case, the standard server port 25565, will be exposed on your host machine.

> If you plan on running a server for a longer amount of time it is highly recommended using a management layer such as [Docker Compose](#using-docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](#deployment-templates-and-examples) to allow for incremental reconfiguration and image upgrades.

> Be sure to always include `-e EULA=TRUE` in your commands and container definitions, as Mojang/Microsoft requires EULA acceptance.

By default, the container will download the latest version of the ""vanilla"" [Minecraft: Java Edition server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) provided by Mojang. The [`VERSION`](#versions) and the [`TYPE`](#server-types) can be configured to create many variations of desired Minecraft server. 

## Mitigated Log4jShell Vulnerability

**Please ensure you have pulled the latest image** since [all official mitigations](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition) are automatically applied by the container startup process.

## Looking for a Bedrock Dedicated Server

For Minecraft clients running on consoles, mobile, or native Windows, you'll need to
use this image instead:

[itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server)

## Interacting with the server

[RCON](http://wiki.vg/RCON) is enabled by default, so you can `exec` into the container to
access the Minecraft server console:

```
docker exec -i mc rcon-cli
```

Note: The `-i` is required for interactive use of rcon-cli.

To run a simple, one-shot command, such as stopping a Minecraft server, pass the command as arguments to `rcon-cli`, such as:

```
docker exec mc rcon-cli stop
```

_The `-i` is not needed in this case._

If rcon is disabled you can send commands by passing them as arguments to the packaged `mc-send-to-console` script. For example, a player can be op'ed in the container `mc` with: 

```shell
docker exec mc mc-send-to-console op player
            |                     |
            +- container name     +- Minecraft commands start here
```

In order to attach and interact with the Minecraft server, add `-it` when starting the container, such as

    docker run -d -it -p 25565:25565 --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

With that you can attach and interact at any time using

    docker attach mc

and then Control-p Control-q to **detach**.

For remote access, configure your Docker daemon to use a `tcp` socket (such as `-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375`)
and attach from another machine:

    docker -H $HOST:2375 attach mc

Unless you're on a home/private LAN, you should [enable TLS access](https://docs.docker.com/articles/https/).

## Data Directory

Everything the container manages is located under the **container's** `/data` path, as shown here:

![](docs/level-vs-world.drawio.png)

> NOTE: The container path `/data` is pre-declared as a volume, so if you do nothing then it will be allocated as an anonymous volume. As such, it is subject to removal when the container is removed. 

### Attaching data directory to host filesystem

In most cases the easiest way to persist and work with the minecraft data files is to use the [volume mounting](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) `-v` argument to map a directory on your host machine to the container's `/data` directory. In the following example, the path `/home/user/minecraft-data` **must be** a directory on your host machine:

    -v /home/user/minecraft-data:/data
       ------------------------- -----
        |                         |
        |                         +-- must always be /data
        |
        +-- replace with a directory on your host machine

When attached in this way you can stop the server, edit the configuration under your attached directory and start the server again to pick up the new configuration.

With Docker Compose, setting up a host attached directory is even easier since relative paths can be configured. For example, with the following `docker-compose.yml` Docker will automatically create/attach the relative directory `minecraft-data` to the container.

```yaml
version: ""3""

services:
  mc:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    ports:
      - 25565:25565
    environment:
      EULA: ""TRUE""
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      # attach a directory relative to the directory containing this compose file
      - ./minecraft-data:/data
```

> NOTE: if you have SELinux enabled, then you might need to add `:Z` to the end of volume mount specifications, [as described here](https://prefetch.net/blog/2017/09/30/using-docker-volumes-on-selinux-enabled-servers/).

### Converting anonymous `/data` volume to named volume

If you had used the commands in the first section, without the `-v` volume attachment, then an anonymous data volume was created by Docker. You can later bring over that content to a named or host attached volume using the following procedure.

> In this example, it is assumed the original container was given a `--name` of ""mc"", so change the container identifier accordingly.

> You can also locate the Docker-managed directory from the `Source` field obtained from `docker inspect <container id or name> -f ""{{json .Mounts}}""`

First, stop the existing container:
```shell
docker stop mc
```

Use a temporary container to copy over the anonymous volume's content into a named volume, ""mc"" in this case:
```shell
docker run --rm --volumes-from mc -v mc:/new alpine cp -avT /data /new
```

Now you can recreate the container with any environment variable changes, etc by attaching the named volume created from the previous step:
```shell
docker run -d -it --name mc-new -v mc:/data -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE -e MEMORY=2G itzg/minecraft-server
```

### Locating filesystem path of anonymous volume

The `Source` field from the output of this command will show where the anonymous volume is mounted from:

```shell
docker inspect -f ""{{json .Mounts}}"" CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
```

> **NOTE** On Windows with WSL the volumes path is `\\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\data\docker\volumes`

## Versions

To use a different Minecraft version, pass the `VERSION` environment variable (case sensitive), which can have the value

- LATEST (the default)
- SNAPSHOT
- or a specific version, such as ""1.7.9""

For example, to use the latest snapshot:

    docker run -d -e VERSION=SNAPSHOT ...

or a specific version:

    docker run -d -e VERSION=1.7.9 ...

When using ""LATEST"" or ""SNAPSHOT"" an upgrade can be performed by simply restarting the container.
During the next startup, if a newer version is available from the respective release channel, then
the new server jar file is downloaded and used. _NOTE: over time you might see older versions of
the server jar remain in the `/data` directory. It is safe to remove those._

## Running Minecraft server on different Java version

> **For Forge versions less than 1.18, you _must_ use the `java8-multiarch` (or other java8) image tag.**

When using the image `itzg/minecraft-server` without a tag, the `latest` image tag is implied from the table below. To use a different version of Java, please use an alternate tag to run your Minecraft server container.

| Tag name          | Java version | Linux  | JVM Type    | Architecture      |
|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| latest            | 17           | Ubuntu | Hotspot     | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java8             | 8            | Alpine | Hotspot     | amd64             |
| java8-jdk         | 8            | Ubuntu | Hotspot+JDK | amd64             |
| java8-multiarch   | 8            | Ubuntu | Hotspot     | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java8-openj9      | 8            | Debian | OpenJ9      | amd64             |
| java8-graalvm-ce  | 8            | Oracle | GraalVM CE  | amd64             |
| java11            | 11           | Ubuntu | Hotspot     | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java11-jdk        | 11           | Ubuntu | Hotspot+JDK | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java11-openj9     | 11           | Debian | OpenJ9      | amd64             |
| java17            | 17           | Ubuntu | Hotspot     | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java17-jdk        | 17           | Ubuntu | Hotspot+JDK | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java17-openj9     | 17           | Debian | OpenJ9      | amd64             |
| java17-graalvm-ce | 17           | Oracle | GraalVM CE  | amd64,arm64       |
| java17-alpine     | 17           | Alpine | Hotspot     | amd64             |

For example, to use Java version 8 on any supported architecture:

    docker run --name mc itzg/minecraft-server:java8-multiarch

> Keep in mind that some versions of Minecraft server, such as Forge before 1.17, can't work on the newest versions of Java. Instead, one of the Java 8 images should be used. Also, FORGE doesn't support openj9 JVM implementation.
> 
> Some versions of vanilla Minecraft, such as 1.10, also do not run correctly with Java 17. If in doubt, use `java8-multiarch` for any version less than 1.17.

### Deprecated Image Tags

The following image tags have been deprecated and are no longer receiving updates:
- adopt13
- adopt14
- adopt15
- openj9-nightly
- multiarch-latest
- java16/java16-openj9

## Healthcheck

This image contains [mc-monitor](https://github.com/itzg/mc-monitor) and uses its `status` command to continually check on the container's. That can be observed from the `STATUS` column of `docker ps`

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS                                 NAMES
b418af073764        mc                  ""/start""            43 seconds ago      Up 41 seconds (healthy)   0.0.0.0:25565->25565/tcp, 25575/tcp   mc
```

You can also query the container's health in a script friendly way:

```
> docker container inspect -f ""{{.State.Health.Status}}"" mc
healthy
```

There's actually a wrapper script called `mc-health` that takes care of calling `mc-monitor status` with the correct arguments. If needing to customize the health checks parameters, such as in a compose file, then use something like the following in the service declaration:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: mc-health
  start_period: 1m
  interval: 5s
  retries: 20
```

Some orchestration systems, such as Portainer, don't allow for disabling the default `HEALTHCHECK` declared by this image. In those cases you can approximate the disabling of healthchecks by setting the environment variable `DISABLE_HEALTHCHECK` to `true`.

## Deployment Templates and Examples

### Helm Charts

  - [Helm Chart repo](https://itzg.github.io/minecraft-server-charts/)
- [mcsh/server-deployment](https://github.com/mcserverhosting-net/charts)

### Examples

The [examples directory](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/tree/master/examples) also provides examples of deploying the [itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server/) Docker image.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS) Deployment

If you're looking for a simple way to deploy this to the Amazon Web Services Cloud, check out the [Minecraft Server Deployment (CloudFormation) repository](https://github.com/vatertime/minecraft-spot-pricing). This repository contains a CloudFormation template that will get you up and running in AWS in a matter of minutes. Optionally it uses Spot Pricing so the server is very cheap, and you can easily turn it off when not in use.

### Using Docker Compose

Rather than type the server options below, the port mappings above, etc
every time you want to create new Minecraft server, you can now use
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Start with a
`docker-compose.yml` file like the following:

```yml
version: ""3""

services:
  mc:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    ports:
      - 25565:25565
    environment:
      EULA: ""TRUE""
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    restart: unless-stopped
```

and in the same directory as that file run

    docker-compose up -d

Now, go play...or adjust the `environment` section to configure
this server instance.

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot the container initialization, such as when server files are pre-downloaded, set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `true`. The container logs will include **much more** output, and it is highly recommended including that output when reporting any [issues](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/issues).

To troubleshoot just the command-line used to start the Minecraft server, set the environment variable `DEBUG_EXEC` to `true`.

To troubleshoot any issues with memory allocation reported by the JVM, set the environment variable `DEBUG_MEMORY` to `true`.

## Server types

### Running a Forge Server

Enable [Forge server](http://www.minecraftforge.net/) mode by adding a `-e TYPE=FORGE` to your command-line.

The overall version is specified by `VERSION`, [as described in the section above](#versions) and will run the recommended Forge version by default. You can also choose to run a specific Forge version with `FORGE_VERSION`, such as `-e FORGE_VERSION=14.23.5.2854`.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=FORGE \
        -e VERSION=1.12.2 -e FORGE_VERSION=14.23.5.2854 \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

To use a pre-downloaded Forge installer, place it in the attached `/data` directory and
specify the name of the installer file with `FORGE_INSTALLER`, such as:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e FORGE_INSTALLER=forge-1.11.2-13.20.0.2228-installer.jar ...

To download a Forge installer from a custom location, such as your own file repository, specify
the URL with `FORGE_INSTALLER_URL`, such as:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e FORGE_INSTALLER_URL=http://HOST/forge-1.11.2-13.20.0.2228-installer.jar ...

In both of the cases above, there is no need for the `VERSION` or `FORGEVERSION` variables.

> If an error occurred while installing Forge, it might be possible to resolve by temporarily setting `FORGE_FORCE_REINSTALL` to ""true"". Be sure to remove that variable after successfully starting the server.

### Running a Fabric Server

Enable [Fabric server](https://fabricmc.net/) mode by adding a `-e TYPE=FABRIC` to your command-line.

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
    -e TYPE=FABRIC \
    -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server
```

By default, the container will install the latest [fabric server launcher](https://fabricmc.net/use/server/), using the latest [fabric-loader](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/documentation:fabric_loader) against the minecraft version you have defined with `VERSION` (defaulting to the latest vanilla release of the game).

A specific loader or launcher version other than the latest can be requested using `FABRIC_LOADER_VERSION` and `FABRIC_LAUNCHER_VERSION` respectively, such as:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
    -e TYPE=FABRIC \
    -e FABRIC_LAUNCHER_VERSION=0.10.2 \
    -e FABRIC_LOADER_VERSION=0.13.1
```

> If you wish to use an alternative launcher you can:
> * Provide the path to a custom launcher jar available to the container with `FABRIC_LAUNCHER`, relative to `/data` (such as `-e FABRIC_LAUNCHER=fabric-server-custom.jar`)
> * Provide the URL to a custom launcher jar with `FABRIC_LAUNCHER_URL` (such as `-e FABRIC_LAUNCHER_URL=http://HOST/fabric-server-custom.jar`)

See the [Working with mods and plugins](#working-with-mods-and-plugins) section to set up Fabric mods and configuration.

### Running a Quilt Server

Enable [Quilt server](https://quiltmc.org/) mode by adding a `-e TYPE=QUILT` to your command-line.

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
    -e TYPE=QUILT \
    -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server
```

By default, the container will install the latest [quilt server launcher](https://quiltmc.org/install/server/), using the latest [quilt-installer](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-installer) against the minecraft version you have defined with `VERSION` (defaulting to the latest vanilla release of the game).

A specific loader or installer version other than the latest can be requested using `QUILT_LOADER_VERSION` and `QUILT_INSTALLER_VERSION` respectively, such as:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
    -e TYPE=QUILT \
    -e QUILT_LOADER_VERSION=0.16.0 \
    -e QUILT_INSTALLER_VERSION=0.4.1
```

> If you wish to use an alternative launcher you can: 
> * Provide the path to a custom launcher jar available to the container with `QUILT_LAUNCHER`, relative to `/data` (such as `-e QUILT_LAUNCHER=quilt-server-custom.jar`)
> * Provide the URL to a custom launcher jar with `QUILT_LAUNCHER_URL` (such as `-e QUILT_LAUNCHER_URL=http://HOST/quilt-server-custom.jar`)

See the [Working with mods and plugins](#working-with-mods-and-plugins) section to set up Quilt mods and configuration.

### Running a Bukkit/Spigot server

Enable Bukkit/Spigot server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=BUKKIT` or `-e TYPE=SPIGOT` to your command-line.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=SPIGOT \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If the downloaded server jar is corrupted, set `FORCE_REDOWNLOAD` to ""true"" to force a re-download during next container startup. After successfully re-downloading, you should remove that or set to ""false"".

If you are hosting your own copy of Bukkit/Spigot you can override the download URLs with:

- -e BUKKIT_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>
- -e SPIGOT_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>

You can build spigot from source by adding `-e BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=true`

Plugins can either be managed within the `plugins` subdirectory of the [data directory](#data-directory) or you can also [attach a `/plugins` volume](#optional-plugins-mods-and-config-attach-points). If you add plugins while the container is running, you'll need to restart it to pick those up.

[You can also auto-download plugins using `SPIGET_RESOURCES`.](#auto-downloading-spigotmcbukkitpapermc-plugins-with-spiget)

> NOTE some of the `VERSION` values are not as intuitive as you would think, so make sure to click into the version entry to find the **exact** version needed for the download. For example, ""1.8"" is not sufficient since their download naming expects `1.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT-latest` exactly.

### Running a Paper server

Enable Paper server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=PAPER` to your command-line.

By default, the container will run the latest build of [Paper server](https://papermc.io/downloads) but you can also choose to run a specific build with `-e PAPERBUILD=205`.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=PAPER \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If you are hosting your own copy of Paper you can override the download URL with `PAPER_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>`.

If you have attached a host directory to the `/data` volume, then you can install plugins via the `plugins` subdirectory. You can also [attach a `/plugins` volume](#optional-plugins-mods-and-config-attach-points). If you add plugins while the container is running, you'll need to restart it to pick those up.

[You can also auto-download plugins using `SPIGET_RESOURCES`.](#auto-downloading-spigotmcbukkitpapermc-plugins-with-spiget)

### Running a Pufferfish server

A [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish) server, which is ""a highly optimized Paper fork designed for large servers requiring both maximum performance, stability, and ""enterprise"" features.""

    -e TYPE=PUFFERFISH

### Running a Magma server

A [Magma](https://magmafoundation.org/) server, which is a combination of Forge and PaperMC, can be used with

    -e TYPE=MAGMA

> **NOTE** there are limited base versions supported, so you will also need to  set `VERSION`, such as ""1.12.2"", ""1.16.5"", etc.


### Running a Mohist server

A [Mohist](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist) server can be used with

    -e TYPE=MOHIST

> **NOTE** there are limited base versions supported, so you will also need to  set `VERSION`, such as ""1.12.2""

By default the latest build will be used; however, a specific build number can be selected by setting `MOHIST_BUILD`, such as

    -e VERSION=1.16.5 -e MOHIST_BUILD=374

### Running a Catserver type server

A [Catserver](http://catserver.moe/) type server can be used with

    -e TYPE=CATSERVER

> **NOTE** Catserver only provides a single release stream, so `VERSION` is ignored

### Running a Loliserver type server

A [Loliserver](https://github.com/Loli-Server/LoliServer) type server can be used with

    -e TYPE=LOLISERVER

> **NOTE** Loliserver only provides a single release stream, so `VERSION` is ignored

> **Disclaimer** The retrieval of the serverjar is not bulletproof. It can and probably will change in the future.

### Running a Canyon server

[Canyon](https://github.com/canyonmodded/canyon) is a fork of CraftBukkit for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3. It includes multiple enhancements whilst also retaining compatibility with old Bukkit plugins and mods as much as possible.

    -e VERSION=b1.7.3 -e TYPE=CANYON

> **NOTE** only `VERSION=b1.7.3` is supported. Since that version pre-dates the health check mechanism used by this image, that will need to be disabled by setting `DISABLE_HEALTHCHECK=true`.

By default, the latest build will be used; however, a specific build number can be selected by setting `CANYON_BUILD`, such as

    -e CANYON_BUILD=11

### Running a SpongeVanilla server

Enable SpongeVanilla server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA` to your command-line.
    
By default the container will run the latest `STABLE` version.
If you want to run a specific version, you can add `-e SPONGEVERSION=1.11.2-6.1.0-BETA-19` to your command-line.
    
Beware that current [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org) `STABLE` versions for Minecraft 1.12 require using [the Java 8 tag](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version):
    
    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server:java8-multiarch

You can also choose to use the `EXPERIMENTAL` branch.
Just change it with `SPONGEBRANCH`, such as:

    $ docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA -e SPONGEBRANCH=EXPERIMENTAL ...

### Running a Limbo server

A [Limbo](https://github.com/LOOHP/Limbo) server can be run by setting `TYPE` to `LIMBO`.

Configuration options with defaults:

- `LIMBO_BUILD`=LATEST

  The `VERSION` will be ignored so locate the appropriate value from [here](https://ci.loohpjames.com/job/Limbo/) to match the version expected by clients.

- `FORCE_REDOWNLOAD`=false
- `LIMBO_SCHEMA_FILENAME`=default.schem
- `LEVEL`=""Default;${LIMBO_SCHEMA


NAME}""

> NOTE: instead of using format codes in the MOTD, Limbo requires [JSON chat content](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_JSON_text_format#Java_Edition). If a plain string is provided, which is the default, then it gets converted into the required JSON structure. 

### Running a Crucible server

A [Crucible](https://github.com/CrucibleMC/Crucible) server can be run by setting `TYPE` to `CRUCIBLE`.

Configuration options with defaults:

- `CRUCIBLE_RELEASE`=latest

Crucible is only available for 1.7.10, so be sure to set `VERSION=1.7.10`.

## Running a server with a Feed the Beast modpack

> **NOTE** requires one of the Ubuntu with Hotspot images listed in [the Java versions section](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version).

[Feed the Beast application](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/) modpacks are supported by using `-e TYPE=FTBA` (**note** the ""A"" at the end of the type). This server type will automatically take care of downloading and installing the modpack and appropriate version of Forge, so the `VERSION` does not need to be specified.

### Environment Variables:
- `FTB_MODPACK_ID`: **required**, the numerical ID of the modpack to install. The ID can be located by [finding the modpack](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpack) and locating the ID in this part of the URL:
  ```
  https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks/23-ftb-infinity-evolved-17
                                          ^^
  ```
- `FTB_MODPACK_VERSION_ID`: optional, the numerical ID of the version to install. If not specified, the latest version will be installed. The ""Version ID"" can be obtained by hovering over a server file entry and grabbing [this ID in the URL](docs/ftba-version-id-popup.png).

### Upgrading

If a specific `FTB_MODPACK_VERSION_ID` was not specified, simply restart the container to pick up the newest modpack version. If using a specific version ID, recreate the container with the new version ID.

### Example

The following example runs the latest version of [FTB Presents Direwolf20 1.12](https://ftb.neptunepowered.org/pack/ftb-presents-direwolf20-1-12/):

```
docker run -d --name mc-ftb -e EULA=TRUE \
  -e TYPE=FTBA -e FTB_MODPACK_ID=31 \
  -p 25565:25565 \
  itzg/minecraft-server:java8-multiarch
```

> Normally you will also add `-v` volume for `/data` since the mods and config are installed there along with world data.

## Running a server with a CurseForge modpack

### Auto CurseForge Management

To manage a CurseForge modpack automatically with upgrade support, pinned or latest version tracking, set `TYPE` to ""AUTO_CURSEFORGE"". The appropriate mod loader (Forge / Fabric) version will be automatically installed as declared by the modpack.

> **NOTE:**
> Be sure to use the appropriate [image tag for the Java version compatible with the modpack](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version).

Use one of the following to specify the modpack to install:

Pass a page URL to the modpack or a specific file with `CF_PAGE_URL` such as the modpack page ""https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-8"" or a specific file ""https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-8/files/4248390"". For example:

```
-e TYPE=AUTO_CURSEFORGE -e CF_PAGE_URL=https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-8
```

Instead of a URL, the modpack slug can be provided as `CF_SLUG`. The slug is the short identifier visible in the URL after ""/modpacks/"", such as

![img.png](docs/cf-slug.png)

For example:
```
-e TYPE=AUTO_CURSEFORGE -e CF_SLUG=all-the-mods-8
```

With either the modpack page or slug approach, the latest file will be located and used. If a specific version is desired, set either `CF_FILE_ID` to the numerical file ID or use a matching substring with `CF_FILENAME_MATCHER`.

The file ID can be located in the URL like

![img.png](docs/cf-file-id.png)

The following two examples both refer to version 1.0.7 of ATM8:

```
-e TYPE=AUTO_CURSEFORGE -e CF_SLUG=all-the-mods-8 -e CF_FILE_ID=4248390
```

```
-e TYPE=AUTO_CURSEFORGE -e CF_SLUG=all-the-mods-8 -e CF_FILENAME_MATCHER=1.0.7
```

If there are mods that need to be excluded, such as ones that did not properly declare as a client mod via the file's game versions, then they can be excluded by passing a comma or space delimited list of project IDs via `CF_EXLUDE_MODS`

### Old approach

Enable this server mode by adding `-e TYPE=CURSEFORGE` to your command-line,
but note the following additional steps needed...

You need to specify a modpack to run, using the `CF_SERVER_MOD` environment
variable. A CurseForge server modpack is available together with its respective
client modpack at <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks> .

Now you can add a `-e CF_SERVER_MOD=name_of_modpack.zip` to your command-line.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -e TYPE=CURSEFORGE \
        -e CF_SERVER_MOD=SkyFactory_4_Server_4.1.0.zip \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If you want to keep the pre-download modpacks separate from your data directory,
then you can attach another volume at a path of your choosing and reference that.
The following example uses `/modpacks` as the container path as the pre-download area:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -v /path/to/modpacks:/modpacks \
        -e TYPE=CURSEFORGE \
        -e CF_SERVER_MOD=/modpacks/SkyFactory_4_Server_4.1.0.zip \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

### Modpack data directory

By default, CurseForge modpacks are expanded into the sub-directory `/data/FeedTheBeast` and executed from there. (The default location was chosen for legacy reasons, when Curse and FTB were maintained together.)

The directory can be changed by setting `CF_BASE_DIR`, such as `-e CF_BASE_DIR=/data`.

### Buggy start scripts

Some modpacks have buggy or overly complex start scripts. You can avoid using the bundled start script and use this image's standard server-starting logic by adding `-e USE_MODPACK_START_SCRIPT=false`.

### Fixing ""unable to launch forgemodloader""

If your server's modpack fails to load with an error [like this](https://support.feed-the-beast.com/t/cant-start-crashlanding-server-unable-to-launch-forgemodloader/6028/2):

    unable to launch forgemodloader

then you apply a workaround by adding this to the run invocation:

    -e FTB_LEGACYJAVAFIXER=true

## Running a server with a packwiz modpack

[packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/) is a CLI tool for maintaining and providing modpack definitions, with support for both CurseForge and Modrinth as sources. See the [packwiz tutorial](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/getting-started/) for more information.

To configure server mods using a packwiz modpack, set the `PACKWIZ_URL` environment variable to the location of your `pack.toml` modpack definition:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -e TYPE=FABRIC \
        -e ""PACKWIZ_URL=https://example.com/modpack/pack.toml"" \
        itzg/minecraft-server

packwiz modpack defitions are processed before other mod definitions (`MODPACK`, `MODS`, etc.) to allow for additional processing/overrides you may want to perform (in case of mods not available via Modrinth/CurseForge, or you do not maintain the pack).

> packwiz is pre-configured to only download server mods. If client-side mods are downloaded and cause issues, check your pack.toml configuration, and make sure any client-only mods are not set to `""both""`, but rather `""client""` for the side configuration item.

## Working with mods and plugins

### Optional plugins, mods, and config attach points

There are optional volume paths that can be attached to supply content to be copied into the data area:

`/plugins`
: contents are synchronized into `/data/plugins` for Bukkit related server types. Set `SYNC_SKIP_NEWER_IN_DESTINATION=false` if you want files from `/plugins` to take precedence over newer files in `/data/plugins`.

`/mods`
: contents are synchronized into `/data/mods` for Fabric and Forge related server types. The destination can be changed by setting `COPY_MODS_DEST`.

`/config`
: contents are synchronized into `/data/config` by default, but can be changed with `COPY_CONFIG_DEST`. For example, `-v ./config:/config -e COPY_CONFIG_DEST=/data` will allow you to copy over files like `bukkit.yml` and so on directly into the server directory. Set `SYNC_SKIP_NEWER_IN_DESTINATION=false` if you want files from `/config` to take precedence over newer files in `/data/config`.

By default, the [environment variable processing](#replacing-variables-inside-configs) is performed on synchronized files that match the expected suffixes in `REPLACE_ENV_SUFFIXES` (by default ""yml,yaml,txt,cfg,conf,properties,hjson,json,tml,toml"") and are not excluded by `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDES` and `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDE_PATHS`. This processing can be disabled by setting `REPLACE_ENV_DURING_SYNC` to `false`.

If you want old mods/plugins to be removed before the content is brought over from those attach points, then add `-e REMOVE_OLD_MODS=TRUE`. You can fine tune the removal process by specifying the `REMOVE_OLD_MODS_INCLUDE` and `REMOVE_OLD_MODS_EXCLUDE` variables, which are comma separated lists of file glob patterns. If a directory is excluded, then it and all of its contents are excluded. By default, only jars are removed. 

You can also specify the `REMOVE_OLD_MODS_DEPTH` (default is 16) variable to only delete files up to a certain level.

For example: `-e REMOVE_OLD_MODS=TRUE -e REMOVE_OLD_MODS_INCLUDE=""*.jar"" -e REMOVE_OLD_MODS_DEPTH=1` will remove all old jar files that are directly inside the `plugins/` or `mods/` directory.

These paths work well if you want to have a common set of modules in a separate location, but still have multiple worlds with different server requirements in either persistent volumes or a downloadable archive.

> For more flexibility with mods/plugins preparation, you can declare directories to use in [the `MODS` variable](#downloadable-modplugin-pack-for-forge-fabric-and-bukkit-like-servers)

### Auto-downloading SpigotMC/Bukkit/PaperMC plugins with Spiget

The `SPIGET_RESOURCES` variable can be set with a comma-separated list of SpigotMC resource IDs to automatically download [SpigotMC resources/plugins](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/) using [the spiget API](https://spiget.org/). Resources that are zip files will be expanded into the plugins directory and resources that are simply jar files will be moved there.

> NOTE: the variable is purposely spelled SPIG**E**T with an ""E""

The **resource ID** can be located from the numerical part of the URL after the shortname and a dot. For example, the ID is **9089** from

    https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/
                                                   ====

For example, the following will auto-download the [EssentialsX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/) and [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) plugins:

    -e SPIGET_RESOURCES=9089,34315

### Auto-download mods from Modrinth

[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) is an open source modding platform with a clean, easy to use website for finding [Fabric and Forge mods](https://modrinth.com/mods). At startup, the container will automatically locate and download the newest versions of mod files that correspond to the `TYPE` and `VERSION` in use. Older file versions downloaded previously will automatically be cleaned up.

- **MODRINTH_PROJECTS** : comma separated list of project slugs (short name) or IDs. The project ID can be located in the ""Technical information"" section. The slug is the part of the page URL that follows `/mod/`:
  ```
    https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api
                             ----------
                              |
                              +-- project slug
  ```
- **MODRINTH_DOWNLOAD_OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCIES**=true : required dependencies of the project will _always_ be downloaded and optional dependencies can also be downloaded by setting this to `true`
- **MODRINTH_ALLOWED_VERSION_TYPE**=release : the version type is used to determine the newest version to use from each project. The allowed values are `release`, `beta`, `alpha`.

### Downloadable mod/plugin pack for Forge, Fabric, and Bukkit-like Servers

Like the `WORLD` option above, you can specify the URL or path of a ""mod pack""
to download and install into `mods` for Forge/Fabric or `plugins` for Bukkit/Spigot.
To use this option pass the environment variable `MODPACK`, such as

    docker run -d -e MODPACK=http://www.example.com/mods/modpack.zip ...

**NOTE:** The referenced URL must be a zip file with one or more jar files at the
top level of the zip archive. Make sure the jars are compatible with the
particular `TYPE` of server you are running.

You may also download or copy over individual mods using the `MODS` environment variable. `MODS` contains a comma-separated list of
- URL of a jar file
- container path to a jar file
- container path to a directory containing jar files

  docker run -d -e MODS=https://www.example.com/mods/mod1.jar,/plugins/common,/plugins/special/mod2.jar ...

### ForgeAPI usage to use non-version specific projects

**NOTE:** This potentially could lead to unexpected behavior if the Mod receives an update with unexpected behavior.

This is more complicated because you will be pulling/using the latest mod for the release of your game. To get started make sure you have a [CursedForge API Key](https://docs.curseforge.com/#getting-started). Then use the environmental parameters in your docker build.

Please be aware of the following when using these options for your mods:
* Mod Release types: Release, Beta, and Alpha.
* Mod dependencies: Required and Optional
* Mod family: Fabric, Forge, and Bukkit.

Parameters to use the ForgeAPI:

* `MODS_FORGEAPI_KEY` - Required
* `MODS_FORGEAPI_FILE` - Required or use MODS_FORGEAPI_PROJECTIDS (Overrides MODS_FORGEAPI_PROJECTIDS)
* `MODS_FORGEAPI_PROJECTIDS` - Required or use MODS_FORGEAPI_FILE
* `MODS_FORGEAPI_RELEASES` - Default is release, Options: [Release|Beta|Alpha]
* `MODS_FORGEAPI_DOWNLOAD_DEPENDENCIES` - Default is False, attempts to download required mods (releaseType Release) defined in Forge.
* `MODS_FORGEAPI_IGNORE_GAMETYPE` - Default is False, Allows for filtering mods on family type: FORGE, FABRIC, and BUKKIT. (Does not filter for Vanilla or custom)
* `REMOVE_OLD_FORGEAPI_MODS` - Default is False
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_DEPTH` - Default is 1
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_INCLUDE` - Default is *.jar

Example of expected forge api project ids, releases, and key: 

```yaml
  MODS_FORGEAPI_PROJECTIDS: 306612,256717
  MODS_FORGEAPI_RELEASES: Release
  MODS_FORGEAPI_KEY: $WRX...
```

Example of expected ForgeAPI file format.

**Field Description**: 
* `name` is currently unused, but can be used to document each entry.
* `projectId` id is the id found on the CurseForge website for a particular mod
* `releaseType` Type corresponds to forge's R, B, A icon for each file. Default Release, options are (release|beta|alpha).
* `fileName` is used for version pinning if latest file will not work for you.

```json
[
  {
      ""name"": ""fabric api"",
      ""projectId"": ""306612"",
      ""releaseType"": ""release""
  },
  {
      ""name"": ""fabric voice mod"",
      ""projectId"": ""416089"",
      ""releaseType"": ""beta""
  },
  {
      ""name"": ""Biomes o plenty"",
      ""projectId"": ""220318"",
      ""fileName"": ""BiomesOPlenty-1.18.1-15.0.0.100-universal.jar"",
      ""releaseType"": ""release""
  }
]
```

### Generic pack files

To install all the server content (jars, mods, plugins, configs, etc.) from a zip or tgz file, then set `GENERIC_PACK` to the container path or URL of the archive file. This can also be used to apply a CurseForge modpack that is missing a server start script and/or Forge installer.

If multiple generic packs need to be applied together, set `GENERIC_PACKS` instead, with a comma separated list of archive file paths and/or URLs to files.

To avoid repetition, each entry will be prefixed by the value of `GENERIC_PACKS_PREFIX` and suffixed by the value of `GENERIC_PACKS_SUFFIX`, both of which are optional. For example, the following variables

```
GENERIC_PACKS=configs-v9.0.1,mods-v4.3.6
GENERIC_PACKS_PREFIX=https://cdn.example.org/
GENERIC_PACKS_SUFFIX=.zip
```

would expand to `https://cdn.example.org/configs-v9.0.1.zip,https://cdn.example.org/mods-v4.3.6.zip`.

If applying large generic packs, the update can be time-consuming. To skip the update set `SKIP_GENERIC_PACK_UPDATE_CHECK` to ""true"". Conversely, the generic pack(s) can be forced to be applied by setting `FORCE_GENERIC_PACK_UPDATE` to ""true"".

The most time consuming portion of the generic pack update is generating and comparing the SHA1 checksum. To skip the checksum generation, set `SKIP_GENERIC_PACK_CHECKSUM` to ""true.

### Mod/Plugin URL Listing File 

As an alternative to `MODS`, the variable `MODS_FILE` can be set with the path to a text file listing a mod/plugin URL on each line. For example, the following

     -e MODS_FILE=/extras/mods.txt

would load from a file mounted into the container at `/extras/mods.txt`. That file might look like:

```text
https://edge.forgecdn.net/files/2965/233/Bookshelf-1.15.2-5.6.40.jar
https://edge.forgecdn.net/files/2926/27/ProgressiveBosses-2.1.5-mc1.15.2.jar
# This and next line are ignored
#https://edge.forgecdn.net/files/3248/905/goblintraders-1.3.1-1.15.2.jar
https://edge.forgecdn.net/files/3272/32/jei-1.15.2-6.0.3.16.jar
https://edge.forgecdn.net/files/2871/647/ToastControl-1.15.2-3.0.1.jar
```
> Blank lines and lines that start with a `#` will be ignored

> [This compose file](examples/docker-compose-mods-file.yml) shows another example of using this feature.

> It is recommended to combine this option with `REMOVE_OLD_MODS=TRUE` to ensure the mods/plugins remain consistent with the file's listing.

### Remove old mods/plugins

When the option above is specified (`MODPACK`) you can also instruct script to
delete old mods/plugins prior to installing new ones. This behaviour is desirable
in case you want to upgrade mods/plugins from downloaded zip file.
To use this option pass the environment variable `REMOVE_OLD_MODS=TRUE`, such as

    docker run -d -e REMOVE_OLD_MODS=TRUE -e MODPACK=http://www.example.com/mods/modpack.zip ...

**WARNING:** All content of the `mods` or `plugins` directory will be deleted
before unpacking new content from the MODPACK or MODS.

## Working with world data

### Downloadable world

Instead of mounting the `/data` volume, you can instead specify the URL of a ZIP or compressed TAR file containing an archived world. It will be searched for a file `level.dat` and the containing subdirectory moved to the directory named by `$LEVEL`. This means that most of the archived Minecraft worlds downloadable from the Internet will already be in the correct format.

    docker run -d -e WORLD=http://www.example.com/worlds/MySave.zip ...

**NOTE:** This URL must be accessible from inside the container. Therefore, you should use an IP address or a globally resolvable FQDN, or else the name of a linked container.

**NOTE:** If the archive contains more than one `level.dat`, then the one to select can be picked with `WORLD_INDEX`, which defaults to 1.

### Cloning world from a container path

The `WORLD` option can also be used to reference a directory, zip file, or compressed tar file that will be used as a source to clone or extract the world directory.

For example, the following would initially clone the world's content from `/worlds/basic`. Also notice in the example that you should use a read-only volume attachment to ensure the clone source remains pristine.

```
docker run ... -v $HOME/worlds:/worlds:ro -e WORLD=/worlds/basic
```

The following diagram shows how this option can be used in a compose deployment with a relative directory:

![](docs/world-copy-compose-project.drawio.png)

### Overwrite world on start
The world will only be downloaded or copied if it doesn't exist already. Set `FORCE_WORLD_COPY=TRUE` to force overwrite the world on every server start.

### Custom worlds directory path
To set a custom worlds directory for the Multiverse plugin on a baremetal server, you'd pass the `--world-dir` argument after the jar file.
In order to accomplish the same in a containerized server, set the `EXTRA_ARGS` environment variable in your command line or docker compose yaml to the same argument string. For example:
```
docker run -d -e EXTRA_ARGS='--world-dir ./worlds/'
```
`--world-container`, `-W`, and `--universe` are aliases to `--world-dir` and can also be used.

### Datapacks
Datapacks can be installed in a similar manner to mods/plugins. There are many environment variables which function in the same way they do for [mods](#working-with-mods-and-plugins): 

* `DATAPACKS`: comma-separated list of zip file URL, zip file in container, or directory in container
* `DATAPACKS_FILE`: a text file within the container where each line is a zip file URL, zip file in container, or directory in container
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS`: if ""true"" the datapacks directory is removed of everything matching `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_INCLUDE`, but excluding `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_EXCLUDE` no deeper than `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_DEPTH`
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_DEPTH`: default is 16
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_INCLUDE`: default is `*.zip`
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_EXCLUDE`: default is empty

Datapacks will be placed in `/data/$LEVEL/datapacks`

### VanillaTweaks

[VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resource packs can be installed with a share code from the website **OR** a json file to specify packs to download and install. Datapacks and crafting tweaks will be installed into the current world directory specified by `$LEVEL`. As new versions of the packs are retrieved the previous versions will automatically be cleaned up.

The share code is the part following the hash sign, as shown here:

```
https://vanillatweaks.net/share/#MGr52E
                                 ------
                                  |
                                  +- share code MGr52E
```

Accepted Parameters:

- `VANILLATWEAKS_FILE`: comma separated list of JSON VanillaTweak pack files accessible within the container
- `VANILLATWEAKS_SHARECODE`: comma separated list of share codes

Example of expected VanillaTweaks share codes: 
  **Note**: ResourcePacks, DataPacks, and CraftingTweaks all have separate sharecodes

```yaml
VANILLATWEAKS_SHARECODE: MGr52E,tF1zL2,LnEDwT
```

Example of expected VanillaTweaks files:

```yaml
VANILLATWEAKS_FILE: /config/vt-datapacks.json,/config/vt-craftingtweaks.json,/config/vt-resourcepacks.json
```

Datapacks Json:
```json
{
  ""type"": ""datapacks"",
  ""version"": ""1.18"",
  ""packs"": {
    ""survival"": [
      ""graves"",
      ""multiplayer sleep""
    ],
    ""items"": [""armored elytra""]
  }
}
```

Resourcepacks Json:
```json
{
    ""type"": ""resourcepacks"",
    ""version"": ""1.18"",
    ""packs"": {
        ""aesthetic"": [""CherryPicking"", ""BlackNetherBricks"", ""AlternateBlockDestruction""]
    }
}
```

CraftingTweaks Json:

            ""double slabs"",
            ""back to blocks""
        ]
    }
}
```

## Server configuration

By default, the server configuration will be created and set based on the following environment variables, but only the first time the server is started. If the `server.properties` file already exists, the values in them will not be changed.

If you prefer to manually manage the `server.properties` file, set `OVERRIDE_SERVER_PROPERTIES` to ""false"". Similarly, you can entirely skip the startup script's creation of `server.properties` by setting `SKIP_SERVER_PROPERTIES` to ""true"".

> NOTE: to clear a server property, set the variable to an empty string, such as `-e RESOURCE_PACK=""""`. A variables that maps to a server property that is unset, is ignored and the existing `server.property` is left unchanged. 

### Message of the Day

The message of the day, shown below each server entry in the client UI, can be changed with the `MOTD` environment variable, such as

    -e MOTD=""My Server""

If you leave it off, a default is computed from the server type and version, such as

    A Paper Minecraft Server powered by Docker

That way you can easily differentiate between several servers you may have started.

The section symbol (§) and other unicode characters are automatically converted to allow [formatting codes](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes) to be used consistently with all server versions. For example,

     -e MOTD=""A §l§cMinecraft§r §nserver""

renders

![](docs/motd-example.png)

To produce a multi-line MOTD, you will need to double escape the newline such as

    -e MOTD=""Line one\\nLine two""

### Difficulty

The difficulty level (default: `easy`) can be set like:

    docker run -d -e DIFFICULTY=hard ...

Valid values are: `peaceful`, `easy`, `normal`, and `hard`, and an
error message will be output in the logs if it's not one of these
values.

### Whitelist Players

> **NOTE** it is very important to set this with servers exposed to the internet where you want only limited players to join.

To whitelist players for your Minecraft server, you can:
- Provide a list of usernames and/or UUIDs separated by commas via the `WHITELIST` environment variable  
  `docker run -d -e WHITELIST=user1,uuid2 ...`
- Provide the url or path to a whitelist file via `WHITELIST_FILE` environment variable  
  `docker run -d -e WHITELIST_FILE=/extra/whitelist.json ...`

When either is set, [whitelisting of connecting users](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server.properties#white-list) is enabled . If managing the list manually, `ENABLE_WHITELIST` can be set to ""true"" to set the `white-list` property.

If whitelist configuration already exists, `WHITELIST_FILE` will not be retrieved and any usernames in `WHITELIST` are **added** to the whitelist configuration. You can enforce regeneration of the whitelist on each server startup by setting `OVERRIDE_WHITELIST` to ""true"". This will delete the whitelist file before processing whitelist configuration.

> NOTE: You can provide both `WHITELIST_FILE` and `WHITELIST`, which are processed in that order.

> NOTE: UUIDs passed via `WHITELIST` need to be the dashed variant, otherwise it not be recognised and instead added as a username.

> If running Minecraft 1.7.5 or earlier, these variables will apply to `white-list.txt`, with 1.7.6 implementing support for `whitelist.json`. Make sure your `WHITELIST_FILE` is in the appropriate format.

To [enforce the whitelist changes immediately](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server.properties#enforce-whitelist) when whitelist commands are used , set `ENFORCE_WHITELIST` to ""true"".

### Op/Administrator Players

Similar to the whitelist, to add users as operators (aka adminstrators) to your Minecraft server, you can:
- Provide te url or path to an ops file via `OPS_FILE` environment variable  
    `docker run -d -e OPS_FILE=https://config.example.com/extra/ops.json ...`
- Provide a list of usernames and/or UUIDs separated by commas via the `OPS` environment variable  
    `docker run -d -e OPS=user1,uuid2 ...`

If ops configuration already exists, `OPS_FILE` will not be retrieved and any usernames in `OPS` are **added** to the ops configuration. You can enforce regeneration of the ops configuration on each server startup by setting `OVERRIDE_OPS` to ""true"". This will delete the ops file before processing ops configuration.

> Similar to whitelists, you can provide both `OPS_FILE` and `OPS`, and Minecraft 1.7.5 or earlier will use `ops.txt` rather than `ops.json`.

### Enable/disable initial selection of datapacks

New to [22W42A](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-22w42a), datapacks with feature flags can be controlled before initial world creation by setting these to a comma separated list of packs:

- `INITIAL_ENABLED_PACKS`
  such as ""update_1_20,bundle""
- `INITIAL_DISABLED_PACKS`

### Server icon

A server icon can be configured using the `ICON` variable. The image will be automatically
downloaded, scaled, and converted from any other image format:

    docker run -d -e ICON=http://..../some/image.png ...

The server icon which has been set doesn't get overridden by default. It can be changed and overridden by setting `OVERRIDE_ICON` to `TRUE`.

    docker run -d -e ICON=http://..../some/other/image.png -e OVERRIDE_ICON=TRUE...

### RCON

RCON is **enabled by default** to allow for graceful shut down the server and coordination of save state during backups. RCON can be disabled by setting `ENABLE_RCON` to ""false"".

The default password is ""minecraft"" but **change the password before deploying into production** by setting `RCON_PASSWORD`.

**DO NOT MAP THE RCON PORT EXTERNALLY** unless you aware of all the consequences and have set a **secure password** with `RCON_PASSWORD`. 

> Mapping ports (`-p` command line or `ports` in compose) outside the container and docker networking needs to be a purposeful choice. Most production Docker deployments do not need any of the Minecraft ports mapped externally from the server itself.

By default, the server listens for RCON on port 25575 within the container. It can be changed with `RCON_PORT` but only do this if you have a very good reason. **DO NOT change `rcon.port` via `server.properties`** or integrations will break.

### Query

Enabling this will enable the gamespy query protocol.
By default the query port will be `25565` (UDP) but can easily be changed with the `QUERY_PORT` variable.

    docker run -d -e ENABLE_QUERY=true

### Max players

By default max players is 20, you can increase this with the `MAX_PLAYERS` variable.

    docker run -d -e MAX_PLAYERS=50

### Max world size

This sets the maximum possible size in blocks, expressed as a radius, that the world border can obtain.

    docker run -d -e MAX_WORLD_SIZE=10000

### Allow Nether

Allows players to travel to the Nether.

    docker run -d -e ALLOW_NETHER=true

### Announce Player Achievements

Allows server to announce when a player gets an achievement.

    docker run -d -e ANNOUNCE_PLAYER_ACHIEVEMENTS=true

### Enable Command Block

Enables command blocks

     docker run -d -e ENABLE_COMMAND_BLOCK=true

### Force Gamemode

Force players to join in the default game mode.

- false - Players will join in the gamemode they left in.
- true - Players will always join in the default gamemode.

  `docker run -d -e FORCE_GAMEMODE=false`

### Generate Structures

Defines whether structures (such as villages) will be generated.

- false - Structures will not be generated in new chunks.
- true - Structures will be generated in new chunks.

  `docker run -d -e GENERATE_STRUCTURES=true`

### Hardcore

If set to true, players will be set to spectator mode if they die.

    docker run -d -e HARDCORE=false

### Snooper

If set to false, the server will not send data to snoop.minecraft.net server.

    docker run -d -e SNOOPER_ENABLED=false

### Max Build Height

The maximum height in which building is allowed.
Terrain may still naturally generate above a low height limit.

    docker run -d -e MAX_BUILD_HEIGHT=256

### Max Tick Time

The maximum number of milliseconds a single tick may take before the server watchdog stops the server with the message, A single server tick took 60.00 seconds (should be max 0.05); Considering it to be crashed, server will forcibly shutdown. Once this criteria is met, it calls System.exit(1).
Setting this to -1 will disable watchdog entirely

    docker run -d -e MAX_TICK_TIME=60000

### Spawn Animals

Determines if animals will be able to spawn.

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_ANIMALS=true

### Spawn Monsters

Determines if monsters will be spawned.

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_MONSTERS=true

### Spawn NPCs

Determines if villagers will be spawned.

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_NPCS=true

### Set spawn protection

Sets the area that non-ops can not edit (0 to disable)

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_PROTECTION=0

### View Distance

Sets the amount of world data the server sends the client, measured in chunks in each direction of the player (radius, not diameter).
It determines the server-side viewing distance.

    docker run -d -e VIEW_DISTANCE=10

### Level Seed

If you want to create the Minecraft level with a specific seed, use `SEED`, such as

    -e SEED=1785852800490497919

If using a negative value for the seed, make sure to quote the value such as:

    -e SEED=""-1785852800490497919""

### Game Mode

By default, Minecraft servers are configured to run in Survival mode. You can
change the mode using `MODE` where you can either provide the [standard
numerical values](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Game_mode#Game_modes) or the
shortcut values:

- creative
- survival
- adventure
- spectator (only for Minecraft 1.8 or later)

For example:

    docker run -d -e MODE=creative ...

### PVP Mode

By default, servers are created with player-vs-player (PVP) mode enabled. You can disable this with the `PVP`
environment variable set to `false`, such as

    docker run -d -e PVP=false ...

### Level Type and Generator Settings

By default, a standard world is generated with hills, valleys, water, etc. A different level type can
be configured by setting `LEVEL_TYPE` to [an expected type listed here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server.properties#level-type).

For some of the level types, `GENERATOR_SETTINGS` can be used to further customize the world generation [as described here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server.properties#generator-settings).

### Custom Server Resource Pack

You can set a link to a custom resource pack and set it's checksum using the `RESOURCE_PACK` and `RESOURCE_PACK_SHA1` options respectively, the default is blank:

    docker run -d -e 'RESOURCE_PACK=http://link.com/to/pack.zip?=1' -e 'RESOURCE_PACK_SHA1=d5db29cd03a2ed055086cef9c31c252b4587d6d0'

You can enforce the resource pack on clients by setting `RESOURCE_PACK_ENFORCE` to `TRUE` (default: `FALSE`).

### Level / World Save Name

You can either switch between world saves or run multiple containers with different saves by using the `LEVEL` option,
where the default is ""world"":

    docker run -d -e LEVEL=bonus ...

> **NOTE:** if running multiple containers be sure to either specify a different `-v` host directory for each
`LEVEL` in use or don't use `-v` and the container's filesystem will keep things encapsulated.

> **INFO** Refer to the [data directory](#data-directory) section for a visual description of where the `$LEVEL` directory is situated.

### Online mode

By default, server checks connecting players against Minecraft's account database. If you want to create an offline server or your server is not connected to the internet, you can disable the server to try connecting to minecraft.net to authenticate players with environment variable `ONLINE_MODE`, like this

    docker run -d -e ONLINE_MODE=FALSE ...

### Allow flight

Allows users to use flight on your server while in Survival mode, if they have a mod that provides flight installed.

    -e ALLOW_FLIGHT=TRUE|FALSE

### Server name

The server name (e.g. for bungeecord) can be set like:

    docker run -d -e SERVER_NAME=MyServer ...

### Server port

> **WARNING:** only change this value if you know what you're doing. It is only needed when using host networking and it is rare that host networking should be used. Use `-p` port mappings instead.

If you must, the server port can be set like:

    docker run -d -e SERVER_PORT=25566 ...

**however**, be sure to change your port mapping accordingly and be prepared for some features to break.

### Other server property mappings

## Miscellaneous Options

### Replacing variables inside configs

Sometimes you have mods or plugins that require configuration information that is only available at runtime.
For example if you need to configure a plugin to connect to a database,
you don't want to include this information in your Git repository or Docker image.
Or maybe you have some runtime information like the server name that needs to be set
in your config files after the container starts.

For those cases there is the option to replace defined variables inside your configs
with environment variables defined at container runtime.

When the environment variable `REPLACE_ENV_IN_PLACE` is set to `true` (the default), the startup script will go through all files inside the container's `/data` path and replace variables that match the container's environment variables. Variables can instead (or in addition to) be replaced in files sync'ed from `/plugins`, `/mods`, and `/config` by setting `REPLACE_ENV_DURING_SYNC` to `true` (defaults to `false`). 

Variables that you want to replace need to be declared inside curly brackets and prefixed with a dollar sign, such as  `${CFG_YOUR_VARIABLE}`, which is same as many scripting languages.

You can also change `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX`, which defaults to ""CFG_"", to limit which environment variables are allowed to be used. For example, with ""CFG_"" as the prefix, the variable `${CFG_DB_HOST}` would be subsituted, but not `${DB_HOST}`.

If you want to use a file's content for value, such as when using secrets mounted as files, declare the placeholder named like normal in the file and declare an environment variable named the same but with the suffix `_FILE`. 

For example, a `my.cnf` file could contain:

```
[client]
password = ${CFG_DB_PASSWORD}
```

...a secret declared in the compose file with:
```yaml
secrets:
  db_password:
    external: true
```

...and finally the environment variable would be named with a `_FILE` suffix and point to the mounted secret:
```yaml
    environment:
      CFG_DB_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
```

Variables will be replaced in files with the following extensions:
`.yml`, `.yaml`, `.txt`, `.cfg`, `.conf`, `.properties`.

Specific files can be excluded by listing their name (without path) in the variable `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDES`.

Paths can be excluded by listing them in the variable `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDE_PATHS`. Path
excludes are recursive. Here is an example:
```
REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDE_PATHS=""/data/plugins/Essentials/userdata /data/plugins/MyPlugin""
```

Here is a full example where we want to replace values inside a `database.yml`.

```yml

---
database:
  host: ${CFG_DB_HOST}
  name: ${CFG_DB_NAME}
  password: ${CFG_DB_PASSWORD}
```

This is how your `docker-compose.yml` file could look like:

```yml
version: ""3.8""
# Other docker-compose examples in /examples

services:
  minecraft:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    ports:
      - ""25565:25565""
    volumes:
      - ""mc:/data""
    environment:
      EULA: ""TRUE""
      ENABLE_RCON: ""true""
      RCON_PASSWORD: ""testing""
      RCON_PORT: 28016
      # enable env variable replacement
      REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES: ""TRUE""
      # define an optional prefix for your env variables you want to replace
      ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX: ""CFG_""
      # and here are the actual variables
      CFG_DB_HOST: ""http://localhost:3306""
      CFG_DB_NAME: ""minecraft""
      CFG_DB_PASSWORD_FILE: ""/run/secrets/db_password""

volumes:
  mc:
  rcon:

secrets:
  db_password:
    file: ./db_password
```

### Patching existing files

JSON path based patches can be applied to one or more existing files by setting the variable `PATCH_DEFINITIONS` to the path of a directory that contains one or more [patch definition json files](https://github.com/itzg/mc-image-helper#patchdefinition) or a [patch set json file](https://github.com/itzg/mc-image-helper#patchset).

Variable placeholders in the patch values can be restricted by setting `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX`, which defaults to ""CFG_"".

The following example shows a patch-set file were various fields in the `paper.yaml` configuration file can be modified and added:

```json
{
  ""patches"": [
    {
      ""file"": ""/data/paper.yml"",
      ""ops"": [
        {
          ""$set"": {
            ""path"": ""$.verbose"",
            ""value"": true
          }
        },
        {
          ""$set"": {
            ""path"": ""$.settings['velocity-support'].enabled"",
            ""value"": ""${CFG_VELOCITY_ENABLED}"",
            ""value-type"": ""bool""
          }
        },
        {
          ""$put"": {
            ""path"": ""$.settings"",
            ""key"": ""my-test-setting"",
            ""value"": ""testing""
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> **NOTES:** Only JSON and Yaml files can be patched at this time. TOML support is planned to be added next. Removal of comments and other cosmetic changes will occur when patched files are processed.

### Running with a custom server JAR

If you would like to run a custom server JAR, set `-e TYPE=CUSTOM` and pass the custom server
JAR via `CUSTOM_SERVER`. It can either be a URL or a container path to an existing JAR file.

If it is a URL, it will only be downloaded into the `/data` directory if it wasn't already. As
such, if you need to upgrade or re-download the JAR, then you will need to stop the container,
remove the file from the container's `/data` directory, and start again.

### Force re-download of the server file

For VANILLA, FORGE, BUKKIT, SPIGOT, PAPER, CURSEFORGE, SPONGEVANILLA server types, set
`$FORCE_REDOWNLOAD` to some value (e.g. 'true) to force a re-download of the server file for
the particular server type. by adding a `-e FORCE_REDOWNLOAD=true` to your command-line.

For example, with PaperSpigot, it would look something like this:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
    -e TYPE=PAPER -e FORCE_REDOWNLOAD=true \
    -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server
```

### Running as alternate user/group ID

By default, the container will switch to user ID 1000 and group ID 1000;
however, you can override those values by setting `UID` and/or `GID` as environmental entries, during the `docker run` command.

    -e UID=1234
    -e GID=1234

The container will also skip user switching if the `--user`/`-u` argument
is passed to `docker run`.

### Memory Limit

By default, the image declares an initial and maximum Java memory-heap limit of 1 GB. There are several ways to adjust the memory settings:

- `MEMORY`: ""1G"" by default, can be used to adjust both initial (`Xms`) and max (`Xmx`) memory heap settings of the JVM
- `INIT_MEMORY`: independently sets the initial heap size
- `MAX_MEMORY`: independently sets the max heap size

The values of all three are passed directly to the JVM and support format/units as `<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K]`. For example:

    -e MEMORY=2G

To let the JVM calculate the heap size from the container declared memory limit, unset `MEMORY` with an empty value, such as `-e MEMORY=""""`. By default, the JVM will use 25% of the container memory limit as the heap limit; however, as an example the following would tell the JVM to use 75% of the container limit of 2GB of memory:

     -e MEMORY="""" -e JVM_XX_OPTS=""-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75"" -m 2000M

> The settings above only set the Java **heap** limits. Memory resource requests and limits on the overall container should also account for non-heap memory usage. An extra 25% is [a general best practice](https://dzone.com/articles/best-practices-java-memory-arguments-for-container).

### JVM Options

General JVM options can be passed to the Minecraft Server invocation by passing a `JVM_OPTS`
environment variable. The JVM requires `-XX` options to precede `-X` options, so those can be declared in `JVM_XX_OPTS`. Both variables are space-delimited, raw JVM arguments.

```
docker run ... -e JVM_OPTS=""-someJVMOption someJVMOptionValue"" ...
```

**NOTE** When declaring `JVM_OPTS` in a compose file's `environment` section with list syntax, **do not** include the quotes:

```yaml
    environment:
      - EULA=true
      - JVM_OPTS=-someJVMOption someJVMOptionValue 
```

Using object syntax is recommended and more intuitive:

```yaml
    environment:
      EULA: ""true""
      JVM_OPTS: ""-someJVMOption someJVMOptionValue""
# or
#     JVM_OPTS: -someJVMOption someJVMOptionValue
```

As a shorthand for passing several system properties as `-D` arguments, you can instead pass a comma separated list of `name=value` or `name:value` pairs with `JVM_DD_OPTS`. (The colon syntax is provided for management platforms like Plesk that don't allow `=` inside a value.)

For example, instead of passing

```yaml
  JVM_OPTS: -Dfml.queryResult=confirm -Dname=value
```

you can use

```yaml
  JVM_DD_OPTS: fml.queryResult=confirm,name=value
```

### Extra Arguments

Arguments that would usually be passed to the jar file (those which are written after the filename) can be passed via the `EXTRA_ARGS` environment variable.

See [Custom worlds directory path](#custom-worlds-directory-path) for an example.

### Interactive and Color Console

If you would like to `docker attach` to the Minecraft server console with color and interactive capabilities, then add

```
  -e EXEC_DIRECTLY=true
```

> **NOTES**
>
> This feature doesn't work via rcon, so you will need to `docker attach` to the container. Use the sequence Ctrl-P, Ctrl-Q to detach. 
> 
> This will bypass graceful server shutdown handling when using `docker stop`, so be sure the server console's `stop` command.
> 
> Make to enable stdin and tty with `-it` when using `docker run` or `stdin_open: true` and `tty: true` when using docker compose.
>
> This feature is incompatible with Autopause and cannot be set when `ENABLE_AUTOPAUSE=true`.

### Server Shutdown Options

To allow time for players to finish what they're doing during a graceful server shutdown, set `STOP_SERVER_ANNOUNCE_DELAY` to a number of seconds to delay after an announcement is posted by the server.

> **NOTE** be sure to adjust Docker's shutdown timeout accordingly, such as using [the -t option on docker-compose down](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/down/).

### OpenJ9 Specific Options

The openj9 image tags include specific variables to simplify configuration:

- `-e TUNE_VIRTUALIZED=TRUE` : enables the option to
  [optimize for virtualized environments](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/xtunevirtualized/)
- `-e TUNE_NURSERY_SIZES=TRUE` : configures nursery sizes where the initial size is 50%
  of the `MAX_MEMORY` and the max size is 80%.

### Enabling rolling logs

By default the vanilla log file will grow without limit. The logger can be reconfigured to use a rolling log files strategy by using:

```
  -e ENABLE_ROLLING_LOGS=true
```

> **NOTE** this will interfere with interactive/color consoles [as described in the section above](#interactive-and-color-console)

### Timezone Configuration

You can configure the timezone to match yours by setting the `TZ` environment variable:

        -e TZ=Europe/London

such as:

        docker run -d -it -e TZ=Europe/London -p 25565:25565 --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

Or mounting `/etc/timezone` as readonly (not supported on Windows):

        -v /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro

such as:

        docker run -d -it -v /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro -p 25565:25565 --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

### Enable Remote JMX for Profiling

To enable remote JMX, such as for profiling with VisualVM or JMC, add the environment variable `ENABLE_JMX=true`, set `JMX_HOST` to the IP/host running the Docker container, and add a port forwarding of TCP port 7091, such as:

```
-e ENABLE_JMX=true -e JMX_HOST=$HOSTNAME -p 7091:7091
```

### Enable Aikar's Flags

[Aikar has done some research](https://aikar.co/2018/07/02/tuning-the-jvm-g1gc-garbage-collector-flags-for-minecraft/) into finding the optimal JVM flags for GC tuning, which becomes more important as more users are connected concurrently. The set of flags documented there can be added using

    -e USE_AIKAR_FLAGS=true

When `MEMORY` is greater than or equal to 12G, then the Aikar flags will be adjusted according to the article.

### HTTP Proxy

You may configure the use of an HTTP/HTTPS proxy by passing the proxy's URL via the `PROXY`
environment variable. In [the example compose file](examples/docker-compose-proxied.yml) it references
a companion squid proxy by setting the equivalent of

    -e PROXY=proxy:3128

### Using ""noconsole"" option

Some older versions (pre-1.14) of Spigot required `--noconsole` to be passed when detaching stdin, which can be done by setting `-e CONSOLE=FALSE`.

### Explicitly disable GUI

Some older servers get confused and think that the GUI interface is enabled. You can explicitly
disable that by passing `-e GUI=FALSE`.

### Stop Duration

When the container is signalled to stop, the Minecraft process wrapper will attempt to send a ""stop"" command via RCON or console and waits for the process to gracefully finish. By default it waits 60 seconds, but that duration can be configured by setting the environment variable `STOP_DURATION` to the number of seconds.

### Setup only

If you are using a host-attached data directory, then you can have the image setup the Minecraft server files and stop prior to launching the server process by setting `SETUP_ONLY` to `true`. 
    
### Enable Flare Flags
    
To enable the JVM flags required to fully support the [Flare profiling suite](https://blog.airplane.gg/flare), set the following variable:
    
    -e USE_FLARE_FLAGS=true
    
Flare is built-in to Pufferfish/Purpur, and is available in [plugin form](https://github.com/TECHNOVE/FlarePlugin) for other server types.

### Enable support for optimized SIMD operations

To enable support for optimized SIMD operations, the JVM flag can be set with the following variable:

    -e USE_SIMD_FLAGS=true

SIMD optimized operations are supported by Pufferfish and Purpur.

### Enable timestamps in init logs

Before the container starts the Minecraft Server its output is prefixed with `[init]`, such as

```
[init] Starting the Minecraft server...
```

To also include the timestamp with each log, set `LOG_TIMESTAMP` to ""true"". The log output will then look like:

```
[init] 2022-02-05 16:58:33+00:00 Starting the Minecraft server...
```

### Auto-execute RCON commands

RCON commands can be configured to execute when the server starts, a client connects, or a client disconnects.

> When declaring several commands within a compose file environment variable, it's easiest to use YAML's `|-` [block style indicator](https://yaml-multiline.info/).

**On Server Start:**

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_STARTUP:  |-
        gamerule doFireTick false
        pregen start 200
```

**On Client Connection:**

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_ON_CONNECT:  |-
        team join New @a[team=]
```

**Note:**
* On client connect we only know there was a connection, and not who connected. RCON commands will need to be used for that.

**On Client Disconnect:**

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_ON_DISCONNECT:  |-
        gamerule doFireTick true
```

**On First Client Connect**

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_FIRST_CONNECT: |-
        pregen stop
```

**On Last Client Disconnect**

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_LAST_DISCONNECT: |-
        kill @e[type=minecraft:boat]
        pregen start 200

```

**Example of rules for new players**

Uses team NEW and team OLD to track players on the server. So move player with no team to NEW, run a command, move them to team OLD.
[Reference Article](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/redstone-discussion-and/2213523-detect-players-first-join)

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_STARTUP:  |-
        /pregen start 200
        /gamerule doFireTick false
        /team add New
        /team add Old
      RCON_CMDS_ON_CONNECT: |-
        /team join New @a[team=]
        /give @a[team=New] birch_boat
        /team join Old @a[team=New]
      RCON_CMDS_FIRST_CONNECT: |-
        /pregen stop
      RCON_CMDS_LAST_DISCONNECT: |-
        /kill @e[type=minecraft:boat]
        /pregen start 200
```

## Autopause

### Description

There are various bug reports on [Mojang](https://bugs.mojang.com) about high CPU usage of servers with newer versions, even with few or no clients connected (e.g. [this one](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149018), in fact the functionality is based on [this comment in the thread](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149018?focusedCommentId=593606&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-593606)).

An autopause functionality has been added to this image to monitor whether clients are connected to the server. If for a specified time no client is connected, the Java process is stopped. When knocking on the server port (e.g. by the ingame Multiplayer server overview), the process is resumed. The experience for the client does not change.

Of course, even loaded chunks are not ticked when the process is stopped.

**You must greatly increase or disable max-tick-time watchdog functionality.** From the server's point of view, the pausing causes a single tick to take as long as the process is stopped, so the server watchdog might intervene after the process is continued, possibly forcing a container restart. To prevent this, ensure that the `max-tick-time` in the `server.properties` file is set to a very large value or -1 to disable it entirely, which is highly recommended. That can be set with `MAX_TICK_TIME` as described in [the section below](#max-tick-time).

> **NOTE:** Non-vanilla versions might have their own configuration file, you might have to disable their watchdogs separately. For PaperMC servers, you need to send the JVM flag `-Ddisable.watchdog=true`, this can be done with the docker env variable `-e JVM_DD_OPTS=disable.watchdog:true`

On startup the `server.properties` file is checked and, if applicable, a warning is printed to the terminal. When the server is created (no data available in the persistent directory), the properties file is created with the Watchdog disabled.

The utility used to wake the server (`knock(d)`) works at network interface level. So the correct interface has to be set using the `AUTOPAUSE_KNOCK_INTERFACE` variable when using non-default networking environments (e.g. host-networking, Portainer oder NAS solutions). See the description of the variable below.

A file called `.paused` is created in `/data` directory when the server is paused and removed when the server is resumed. Other services may check for this file's existence before waking the server.

A starting, example compose file has been provided in [examples/docker-compose-autopause.yml](examples/docker-compose-autopause.yml).

### Enabling Autopause

Enable the Autopause functionality by setting:

```
-e ENABLE_AUTOPAUSE=TRUE
```

Autopause is not compatible with `EXEC_DIRECTLY=true` and the two cannot be set together.

> When configuring kubernetes readiness/liveness health checks with auto-pause enabled, be sure to reference the `mc-health` wrapper script rather than `mc-status` directly.

The following environment variables define the behaviour of auto-pausing:
* `AUTOPAUSE_TIMEOUT_EST`, default `3600` (seconds)
  describes the time between the last client disconnect and the pausing of the process (read as timeout established)
* `AUTOPAUSE_TIMEOUT_INIT`, default `600` (seconds)
  describes the time between server start and the pausing of the process, when no client connects inbetween (read as timeout initialized)
* `AUTOPAUSE_TIMEOUT_KN`, default `120` (seconds)
  describes the time between knocking of the port (e.g. by the main menu ping) and the pausing of the process, when no client connects inbetween (read as timeout knocked)
* `AUTOPAUSE_PERIOD`, default `10` (seconds)
  describes period of the daemonized state machine, that handles the pausing of the process (resuming is done independently)
* `AUTOPAUSE_KNOCK_INTERFACE`, default `eth0`
  <br>Describes the interface passed to the `knockd` daemon. If the default interface does not work, run the `ifconfig` command inside the container and derive the interface receiving the incoming connection from its output. The passed interface must exist inside the container. Using the loopback interface (`lo`) does likely not yield the desired results.

> To troubleshoot, add `DEBUG_AUTOPAUSE=true` to see additional output

## Autostop

An option to stop the server after a specified time has been added for niche applications (e.g. billing saving on AWS Fargate). The function is incompatible with the Autopause functionality, as they basically cancel out each other.

Note that the docker container variables have to be set accordingly (restart policy set to ""no"") and that the container has to be manually restarted.

A starting, example compose file has been provided in [examples/docker-compose-autostop.yml](examples/docker-compose-autostop.yml).

Enable the Autostop functionality by setting:

```
-e ENABLE_AUTOSTOP=TRUE
```

The following environment variables define the behaviour of auto-stopping:
* `AUTOSTOP_TIMEOUT_EST`, default `3600` (seconds)
  describes the time between the last client disconnect and the stopping of the server (read as timeout established)
* `AUTOSTOP_TIMEOUT_INIT`, default `1800` (seconds)
  describes the time between server start and the stopping of the server, when no client connects inbetween (read as timeout initialized)
* `AUTOSTOP_PERIOD`, default `10` (seconds)
  describes period of the daemonized state machine, that handles the stopping of the server

> To troubleshoot, add `DEBUG_AUTOSTOP=true` to see additional output

## Running on RaspberryPi

To run this image on a RaspberryPi 3 B+, 4, or newer, use any of the image tags [list in the Java version section](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version) that specify `armv7` for the architecture, which includes `itzg/minecraft-server:latest`.

> NOTE: you may need to lower the memory allocation, such as `-e MEMORY=750m`

> If experiencing issues such as ""sleep: cannot read realtime clock: Operation not permitted"", ensure `libseccomp` is up to date on your host. In some cases adding `:Z` flag to the `/data` mount may be needed, [but use cautiously](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-the-selinux-label).

Minecraft Overviewer  |Build Status|
====================================
By Andrew Brown and contributors (see CONTRIBUTORS.rst).

Documentation:
    http://docs.overviewer.org

Github code repository:
    https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer

Travis-CI:

The Minecraft Overviewer is a command-line tool for rendering high-resolution
maps of Minecraft worlds. It generates a set of static html and image files and
uses Leaflet to display a nice interactive map.

The Overviewer has been in active development for several years and has many
features, including day and night lighting, cave rendering, mineral overlays,
and many plugins for even more features! It is written mostly in Python with
critical sections in C as an extension module.

Getting Started
---------------
All documentation has been consolidated at our documentation site. For
information on downloading, compiling, installing, and running The Overviewer,
visit the docs site.

http://docs.overviewer.org

A few helpful tips are below, but everyone is going to want to visit the
documentation site for the most up-to-date and complete set of instructions!

Alternatively, the docs are also in the docs/ directory of the source download.
Look in there if you can't access the docs site.

Examples
--------
See examples of The Overviewer in action!

https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer/wiki/Map-examples

Disclaimers
-----------
Before you dive into using this, just be aware that, for large maps, there is a
*lot* of data to parse through and process. If your world is very large, expect
the initial render to take at least an hour, possibly more. (Since Minecraft
maps are practically infinite, the maximum time this could take is also
infinite!)

If you press ctrl-C, it will stop. The next run will pick up where it left off.

Once your initial render is done, subsequent renderings will be MUCH faster due
to all the caching that happens behind the scenes. Just use the same output
directory and it will only update the tiles it needs to.

There are probably some other minor glitches along the way, hopefully they will
be fixed soon. See the `Bugs`_ section below.

Viewing the Results
-------------------
Within the output directory you will find two things: an index.html file, and a
directory hierarchy full of images. To view your world, simply open index.html
in a web browser.

You can throw these files up to a web server to let others view your map.

Bedrock and other formats
=========================

Minecraft Overviewer only supports the world format from the Java edition of Minecraft.
Minecraft Bedrock (the Windows 10 version) is not supported by Overviewer, but users
have reported success using `Amulet <https://www.amuletmc.com/>`__ to convert
Bedrock worlds to the Java format, and then used Overviewer to render the converted
worlds.

4,TheGreyGhost/MinecraftByExample,Java,"MinecraftByExample [1.16.4]
==================
The purpose of MinecraftByExample is to give simple working examples of the important concepts in Minecraft and Forge. If you're anything like me, a good code example is worth several screens of waffling explanation, and can very quickly explain the key concepts.  I also find it much easier to adapt and debug something that already works, than to have to synthesize something from scratch and spend hours trying to discover the missing bit of information I didn't know about.

I've tried to keep the code simple and obvious and to resist the urge to be clever. The examples might not be the most efficient or succinct implementation, I've deliberately left the optimization to you.

Each example is split up to be totally independent of all the others.  The only part of the code which is common to more than one example is the MinecraftByExample class.

If you want more information and explanatory text about the concepts, the following links might be useful:

  - [The Official Forge documentation][forgedocs] (parts of it are rather outdated but on the whole still very useful starting reference)
  - [Guide to how Minecraft works][greyminecraftcoder] (explaining the key concepts for understanding vanilla code)
  - [Fabric Wiki][fabricwiki] (some of it is specific to the Fabric API, but a lot of useful general info too) 
  - [Forge modder support forum][Forge forum] ask for advice from the experts
  - [McJty tutorials][McJty] lots of step-by-step instructions / tutorial
  - [Mr Crayfish Furniture Mod (lots of examples)](https://github.com/MrCrayfish/MrCrayfishFurnitureMod)
  - [Cadiboo's example mod](https://github.com/Cadiboo/Example-Mod) some great tutorials for when you're starting out
  
#### For earlier versions, see the relevant GitHub branch:
 - MBE for Forge 1.8: [1-8final][version1-8]
 - MBE for Forge 1.8.9: [1-8-9final][version1-8-9]
 - MBE for Forge 1.10.2: [1-10-2final][version1-10-2]
 - MBE for Forge 1.11: [1-11final][version1-11]
 - MBE for Forge 1.11.2: [1-11-2final][version1-11-2]
 - MBE for Forge 1.12.2: [1-12-2final][version1-12-2]
 - MBE for Forge 1.14.4: [1-14-4partial][version1-14-4] (partially updated only)
 - MBE for Forge 1.15.2: [1-15-2][version1-15-2] 
 - MBE for Forge 1.16.3: [1-16-3][version1-16-3]

If you are updating from previous forge versions, you will probably find [this link][versionupdates] and [this link][versionupdates1-15] very helpful.  For better or for worse, MCP decided to rename a very large number of classes (eg all Blocks Blockxxx --> xxxxBlock, etc) so this might save you a stack of time.
If you use IntelliJ, you might find these [xml mapping files][mapfiles] useful too

## List of examples

## Usage
  - You can browse directly in GitHub, or alternatively, download it as a zip and browse it locally.

  - If you want to install it and compile it, the basic steps for beginners are:
    1. Download the project as a zip.
    2. Unzip it to an appropriate folder on your computer, such as My Documents.  (Or, if you know how to fork a project on GitHub and import it into a local git repository, you can do that instead)
    3. Look at Forge's README.txt file in this folder and follow the instructions to import it into Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
    4. Use the gradle task runClient to run or debug the project.

### How to compile and run:
1) Execute gradle task runClient to test the client installation
or
2) Execute gradle task runServer to test the dedicated server installation.  (The first time you run this task it will exit without starting the server.  You then need to edit the eula.txt file in the run directory, and execute runServer again.)

Info and Documentation [![Current Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-1.5.21-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327)
----------------------

<a href=""https://discord.gg/j6UNcfr""><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/JXu9C1G.png"" height=""48px""></img></a>

Visit [https://minecraftdev.org](https://minecraftdev.org) for some information about the project.


Installation
------------

This plugin is available on the [JetBrains IntelliJ plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327).

Because of this, you can install the plugin through IntelliJ's internal plugin browser. Navigate to
`File -> Settings -> Plugins` and click the `Browse Repositories...` button at the bottom of the window. In the search
box, simply search for `Minecraft`. You can install it from there and restart IntelliJ to activate the plugin.

Building
--------

Build the plugin with:

`./gradlew build`

The output .zip file for the plugin will be in `build/distributions`.

Test the plugin in IntelliJ with:

`./gradlew runIde`

Code is generated during the build task, to run the generation task without building use:

`./gradlew generate`

This task is necessary to work on the code without errors before the initial build.

To format the code in this project:

`./gradlew format`

This will format using `ktlint` described below in the [style guide](#style-guide) section below.

The [Gradle IntelliJ Plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin)
will handle downloading the IntelliJ dependencies and packaging the
plugin.

Style Guide
-----------

This projects follows the opinionated [`ktlint`](https://ktlint.github.io/) linter and formatter. It uses the
[`ktlint-gradle`](https://github.com/jlleitschuh/ktlint-gradle) plugin to automatically check and format the code in
this repo.

IDE Setup
---------

It's recommended to run the `ktlintApplyToIdea` and `addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook` tasks to configure your
IDE with `ktlint` style settings and to automatically format this project's code before committing:

```
./gradlew ktlintApplyToIdea addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook
```

IntelliJ includes a lot of dependencies transitively, including common dependencies that are used a lot, such as Kotlin,
Commons Lang3, Guava, etc. Unfortunately, the source distribution for IntelliJ does not contain sources for libraries as
well, so these libraries are imported into the IDE without sources by default. If you want to attach sources for (most)
of the dependencies IntelliJ includes, run the `resolveIntellijLibSources` task and refresh the Gradle project in
IntelliJ:

```
./gradlew resolveIntellijLibSources
```

If you're curious about that task, it is implemented in `buildSrc`.

6,jdah/minecraft-weekend,C,"# Minecraft, but I made it in 48 hours*

\* I've actually updated it since - [see this commit for the 48 hour version](https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend/tree/cb19738305804b5734faa7118c1c784f26ff9463).

![screenshot](screenshots/1.png)

#### Features:
- Infinite, procedurally generated world
- Infinite height/depth
- Day/night cycle
- Biomes
- ECS-driven player and entities with full collision and movement
- Full RGB lighting
- Full transparency + translucency support
- Sprite blocks (flowers)
- Animated blocks (water + lava)
- Distance fog
- A whole lot of different block types
- More

#### Building

##### Unix-like
`$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend.git`\
`$ make`

The following static libraries under `lib/` must be built before the main project can be built:

- GLAD `lib/glad/src/glad.o`
- CGLM `lib/cglm/.libs/libcglm.a`
- GLFW `lib/glfw/src/libglfw3.a`
- libnoise `lib/noise/libnoise.a`

All of the above have their own Makefile under their respective subdirectory and can be built with `$ make libs`.
If libraries are not found, ensure that submodules have been cloned.

The game binary, once built with `$ make`, can be found in `./bin/`.

*Be sure* to run with `$ ./bin/game` out of the root directory of the repository.
If you are getting ""cannot open file"" errors (such as ""cannot find ./res/shaders/*.vs""), this is the issue. 

##### Windows

good luck 🤷‍♂️ probably try building under WSL and using an X environment to pass graphics through.

</ul>

<h2>Quick Installation Instuctions</h2>
To run the installation type:<br>
<pre>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/master/SetupMinecraft.sh | bash</pre>

<h2>Installation Guide</h2>
<a href=""https://jamesachambers.com/minecraft-bedrock-edition-ubuntu-dedicated-server-guide/"">Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server Script Installation / Configuration Guide</a>

<h2>Installing Resource Packs / RTX Support</h2>
<p>For instructions on how to install resource packs (including optional RTX support), view my <a href=""https://jamesachambers.com/minecraft-bedrock-server-resource-pack-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">step-by-step Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server Resource Packs / Optional RTX guide here</a>.</p>

<h2>Tested Distributions</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Ubuntu / Ubuntu Server 22.04</li>
 <li>Ubuntu / Ubuntu Server 20.04</li>
 <li>Ubuntu / Ubuntu Server 18.04</li>
 <li>Debian Stretch / Buster</li>
</ul>
  
<h2>Tested Platforms</h2>
<ul>
 <li>All PC X86_64 (WORKING)</li>
 <li><a href=""https://jamesachambers.com/udoo-x86-microboard-breakdown/"">Udoo X86 (WORKING)</a></li>
 <li><a href=""https://jamesachambers.com/install-ubuntu-server-18-04-on-intel-compute-stick-guide/"">Intel Compute Stick (WORKING)</a></li>
 <li>Other X86_64 platforms (WORKING)</li>
  <ul><li>ARM 64bit (WORKING -- speed improved with Box64)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Raspberry Pi 64 bit (WORKING -- Box64)</li>
      <li>Raspberry Pi 32 bit (WORKING -- VERY SLOW -- 64 bit recommended!)</li>
      <li>Tinkerboard (WORKING, 32 bit is slow, 64 bit uses Box64)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Multiple Servers and Installation Paths</h2>
<p>The server supports multiple servers at once.  When you run SetupMinecraft.sh again, pick the identical root path as any previous servers.  The path structure of the scripts is $ROOTPATH/minecraftbe/yourservername, which is why the ""root"" path SetupMinecraft.sh asks you for should always be the same.</p>
<p>The individual server folder is determined by the ""server name"" you enter for your server.  If it's an existing server, the scripts will be safely updated.  If it's a new server, then a new folder will be created under $ROOTPATH/minecraftbe/newservername.</p>
<p>Keep the installation path the same for all servers and the script will manage all this for you.</p>

<h2>Version Override</h2>
You can revert to a previous version with the revert.sh script included in your directory like this: <pre>./revert.sh
Set previous version in version_pin.txt: bedrock-server-1.19.10.20.zip</pre>
If you have a specific version you would like to run, you can also create version_pin.txt yourself like this: <pre>echo ""bedrock-server-1.18.33.02.zip"" > version_pin.txt</pre>
The version hold can be removed by deleting version_pin.txt.  This will allow it to update to the latest version again!

<h2>Troubleshooting Note - Oracle Virtual Machines</h2>
A very common problem people have with the Oracle Virtual Machine tutorials out there that typically show you how to use a free VM is that the VM is much more difficult to configure than just about any other product / offering out there.<br>
The symptom you will have is that nobody will be able to connect.  This is not because of the second set of ports that it shows after startup (that is a nearly 3-4 years now old Bedrock bug and all servers do it).<br>
It is because there are several steps you need to take to open the ports on the Oracle VM.  You need to both:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Set the ingress ports (TCP/UDP) in the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) security list</li>
  <li>*and* set the ingress ports in a Network Security Group assigned to your instance</li>
</ul><br>
Both of these settings are typically required before you will be able to connect to your VM instance.  This is purely configuration related and has nothing to do with the script or the Minecraft server itself.<br><br>
I do not recommend this platform due to the configuration difficulty but the people who have gone through the pain of configuring an Oracle VM have had good experiences with it after that point.  Just keep in mind it's going to be a rough ride through the configuration for most people.<br><br>

<h2>Troubleshooting Note - Hyper-V</h2>
There is a weird bug in Hyper-V that breaks UDP connections on the Minecraft server.  The fix for this is that you have to use a Generation 1 VM with the Legacy LAN network driver.<br>

  <ul>
    <li>Add clean.sh utility script to clean up downloads folder, remove version pinning and force reinstall of current version</li>
    <li>Enable content log by default which shows errors related to resource/behavior packs</li>
  </ul>
  <li>August 12th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Add clean.sh utility script to clean up downloads folder, remove version pinning and force reinstall of current version</li>
    <li>Enable content log by default which shows errors related to resource/behavior packs</li>
  </ul>
  <li>August 10th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Moved DirName variable to a custom variable at the top of SetupMinecraft.sh</li>
  </ul>
  <li>August 4th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Script now removes non-alphanumeric characters from the servername variable (to prevent using quotes and other symbols that will break it)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>August 2nd 2022</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Add Box64 support for 64 bit ARM (aarch64).  32 bit ARM is not recommended as it cannot use Box64 so it will be much slower than if you install a 64-bit version of your OS on the device.</li>
      <li>You must be running a 64-bit OS to benefit from the Box64 increased speeds (both Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi OS have 64-bit versions)</li>
      <li>An easy way to check and make sure you are running 64 bit is to use <pre>uname -m</pre> which will return ""aarch64"" if you are on 64-bit ARM</li>
    </ul>
  <li>July 24th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Use libssl1.1 from repository instead of Ubuntu servers due to it changing every week or two (thanks theblujuice, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/129"">issue #129)</a></li>
    </ul>
  <li>July 21st 2022</li>
    <ul>

    </ul>
  <li>July 14th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Add libssl3 to dependencies</li>
    </ul>
  <li>July 7th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Updated curl fallback installation URL to newest package</li>

    </ul>
  <li>June 11th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Added allowlist.json and permissions.json default template files to prevent crashes when they are missing (thanks Eike)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>June 10th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed problem in escaping screen command in SetupMinecraft.sh (on the startup check)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>June 5th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Added additional escaping to screen -list commands to prevent similar names from matching the grep query (thanks wheelibin)</li>
        <li>Changed grep -q command to use single quotes to prevent expansion of additional characters (I still recommend only letters and numbers for the server label/name for the least amount of trouble)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>May 31st 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Add check to make sure server.properties exists when unzipping server as without it there will be a startup error</li>
    </ul>
  <li>May 26th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Add revert.sh to SetupMinecraft.sh downloads</li>
        <li>Add version override documentation</li>
    </ul>
  <li>May 25th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Added version_pin.txt to allow for manual override of running server version. Run ./revert.sh in your server folder to set version n-1 to run on next restart. Delete version_pin.txt when you want to resume automatic updates. (thanks smallsam)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>May 15th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Added screen -wipe to beginning of start.sh to prevent a startup issue that could occur if there was a ""dead"" screen instance (thanks grimholme)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>May 9th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated fallback installation URL for OpenSSL 1.1</li>
  </ul>
  <li>May 4th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue on Debian where the route command (/sbin/route) is not on the default path by adding a check for this</li>
    <li>Added Ubuntu 22.04 to tested distributions list (I upgraded my desktop OS to this today)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 28th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a line in fixpermissions.sh that could cause picky shells to complain</li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 24th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added dependency package install for libssl1.1 when it's available in apt</li>
    <li>Added fallback installation for libssl1.1 to hopefully fix the installer for Ubuntu 22.04/22.10 and other distros using libssl3</li>
    <li>Fixed a minor 'tail' error message that could occur upon starting the server if no logs were created yet</li>
    <li>Added DEBIAN_NONINTERACTIVE to some apt commands to try to suppress some interactive dialogs (such as running outdated kernel) that were causing the installer to get stuck</li>
    <li>Fixed a mistake in new multicore backup causing it to select the wrong compressor</li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 16th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added multiple CPU core support for backups which should speed up backup process</li>
  </ul>
  <li>March 19th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Removed /sbin qualifier from route command as the PATH variable is now stored at the top of each script by SetupMinecraft.sh (thanks LookedPath, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/120"">issue #120</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>March 10th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Add new allowlist.json to the unzip whitelist (thanks shaman79, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/118"">issue #118</a>)</li>
    <li>Added buy a coffe / donation information (thanks vandersonmota, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/117"">issue #117</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>November 2nd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed extra / in front of permissions fix script (thanks MarkBarbieri, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/109"">issue #109</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>October 31st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed missing sudo from fixpermissions line in start.sh (thanks MarkBarbieri, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/109"">issue #109</a>)</li>
    <li>Fixed missing -a parameter from /etc/sudoers file addition thanks MarkBarbieri, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/109"">issue #109</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>August 1st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated documentation and root path selection prompt to make it more clear that the root directory should be the same for ALL servers</li>
    <li>Don't change unless installing to a different disk, and then use the same root path for ALL servers as they will follow the structure $ROOTPATH/minecraftbe/yourservername</li>
    <li>Choosing a perfect storm of invalid paths has resulted in people's server files being pruned before from being off by one folder sublevel etc.  Please follow instructions carefully here and do not change it and make sure you have backups (saved outside of the main Minecraft backups folder) before ever trying to install an additional server or updating existing scripts.</li>
    <li>Fortunately this person was starting a new server so the pruning didn't get anything serious but I can't stress enough to leave the paths alone unless you're legitimately an expert with a use case like having an entire separate disk for all the Minecraft servers.  Use the same root directory every time (preferably the default)!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 27th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Cleaned up SetupMinecraft.sh and removed redundant code by organizing code into functions</li>
    <li>Scripts now fix all server file permissions on startup</li>
    <li>Added /etc/sudoers.d/minecraftbe file to contain passwordless sudo permission for fixpermissions and sudo systemctl start server</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 21st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated documentation and restart.sh to document how to enable systemd's service showing as ""online"" after called by restart.sh (useful for people tracking the servers using the systemd service) by adding a line to the sudoers file to allow passwordless sudo for the sudo systemctl start yourservername command.  Restart.sh now has commented lines at the bottom along with instructions on how to enable if you need this functionality (most people probably won't)</li>
    <li>Added error redirection to crontab line to help diagnose failures during scheduled restarts and removed ExecStartPre from the service as it wasn't doing anything (run ./fixpermissions.sh if you need to fix the permissions) and caused compatibility issues with older systemd versions</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 17th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added in check to ensure start.sh and other scripts are not being ran as root.  If this happens you have to use sudo screen -r to find the screen and the permissions will be wrong since root isn't the owner of the server files</li>
    <li>If you know you ran the script/server as root (which starts creating files owned by root instead of the regular user) and your server won't start/is wonky run the fixpermissions script from your server folder with ./fixpermissions.sh and it will correct them for you!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 15th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added update.sh convenience script to run SetupMinecraft.sh to update everything to the latest version</li>
    <li>Added validation loop for directory path -- if you are upgrading from an old version you should use the default directory.</li>
    <li>Nothing good can come from changing this and I've never seen or heard of it solving a single problem despite being requested for years (especially if you don't understand relative vs fully qualified Linux paths and other pitfalls -- leave it default!).</li>
    <li>Attempting to solve this problem with safety checks in case this is useful to some people and I just haven't heard about it but it may be removed entirely or turned into a check that you have to download and modify the script to enable if it continues to be a source of strife for people.</li>
    <li>Updated depends.zip for Raspberry Pis</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 4th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added missing sudo line to some prerequistes and removed apt-get install sudo as the script no longer runs as root (install sudo if missing) - thanks Rick Horn</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 3rd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added Accept-Encoding: Identity header to curl as a very small % of users are getting an ""Access Denied"" error without this header (thanks titiscan, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/pull/95"">pull request #95</a></li>
    <li>Added default language header to curl as non-english computers were getting an Access Denied error</li>
    <li>Script now checks for gawk being present in start.sh.  If it's not installed (likely due to reusing old SetupMinecraft.sh files) timestamps will be disabled.  This will prevent the server from failing to start.  This is avoided by not running an old copy of SetupMinecraft.sh!</li>
    <li>Removed broken screen -r command at the end of SetupMinecraft.sh as fixing it actually causes lockups -- instead now gives the command (screen -r) to pull up the Minecraft console.  Press Ctrl+A then Ctrl+D to hide the console once you're inside it.</li>
    <li>Added code to prevent SetupMinecraft.sh from being ran as a local file (please use the new method of curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/master/SetupMinecraft.sh | bash)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 2nd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved dependency detection and installation</li>
    <li>Removed wget dependency</li>
    <li>Added gawk dependency -- this should not have any impact on most systems but on systems that use mawk by default this will fix server startup issues related to timestamps since mawk doesn't support strftime</li>
    <li>Fixed stop.sh's -t countdown option (thanks da99Beast, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/76"">issue #76</a>)</li>
    <li>Fixed a nasty issue where the installation of libcurl3 over the top of libcurl4 was allowed in some configurations (like Ubuntu 18.04) and was clobbering curl (thanks Goretech)</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where empty folders could be created in the wrong location if start.sh was not ran from the server folder (thanks CobraBitYou, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/93"">issue #93</a></li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 1st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Changed from wget to curl as wget is freezing (but curl works)</li>
    <li>Added randomization to user agent</li>
  </ul>
  <li>June 19th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed timestamps to display on every line (thanks murkyl)</li>
    <li>Added chmod command after unzip line to make bedrock_server executable for <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/22"">issue #22</a> (thanks murkyl)</li>
    <li>Merged <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/pull/91"">pull request #91</a> from starkey-01 to add prompt for an alternate installation directory.  This has been requested for a while so thanks starkey-01!</li>
    <li>Merged <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/pull/88"">pull request #88</a> clarifying instructions to run script as non-root user (thanks sparagi!)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>May 23nd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The fixpermissions.sh script now displays the last 5 lines from the latest log file to aid in troubleshooting.  If your server won't start this script often will take care of it and the logs can give useful information otherwise!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>May 22nd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added setting the path variable to each script to prevent service from failing to start due to not being able to find the right path.</li>
    <li>Please redownload SetupMinecraft.sh for this update.  The script will give you a warning each time you start up that it couldn't set the path variable without the new SetupMinecraft.sh script</li>
    <li>Added user agent to wget string to prevent update check from failing</li>
    <li>Added automatic update to SetupMinecraft.sh if it has not been modified for more than 7 days</li>
    <li>Updated Raspberry Pi dependencies</li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 22nd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added a safety check to prevent installing on 32 bit (i386 or i686) operating systems.  The official Bedrock dedicated server has only been released as a 64 bit (x86_64) binary and attempts at emulation on 32 bit have failed to yield any successful results!</li>
    <li>Added chmod +x bedrock_server to start.sh as updates seem to be removing executable permissions sometimes</li>
    <li>Fix removing old backup directory context (thanks murkyl, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/76"">issue #76</a>)<li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 20th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fully qualified route command with /sbin/route to alleviate network check breaking some servers</li>
    <li>Added safety check to prevent using the server label 'minecraftbe' which can break the scripts</li>
    <li>Added libc6 dependency check as several people have reported libns1.so.1 missing</li>
    <li>Added curl and libcurl3 dependency as a fallback for older distros to avoid missing libcurl.so errors</li>
    <li>Added libcrypt1 dependency check</li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 7th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are updating from an old version make sure you remove the old SetupMinecraft.sh and redownload the new version from scratch.  If you are seeing something like userxname in the systemd service you're using an old version of SetupMinecraft.sh and need to download the latest</li>
    <li>Updated fixpermissions.sh -- can fix issues with permissions if you are seeing them!</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with userxname appearing in start.sh and not being updated to the correct username</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue that could trigger PAM authentication in start.sh</li>
  </ul>
  <li>March 16th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a incomplete sudo line in start.sh that was throwing an error (thanks /u/zfa from reddit!)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>February 1st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added fixpermissions.sh utility script to take ownership of Minecraft server files manually (the systemd startup service does this automatically for you if you are using it)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>January 31st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added .\ in front of the screen -q checks to prevent similar usernames from tripping up window detection</li>
    <li>Server now takes ownership of server files on each start to prevent folks a whole heap of trouble and heartache when restoring backups/moving files/etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>December 20th 2020</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added experimental QEMU support for 32 bit (i386, i686) similar to how the ARM support works</li>
  </ul>
  <li>December 18th 2020</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added safety check to prevent the script from being ran as root or sudo.  This would cause the script to be installed to the /root folder.</li>
    <li>If you know what you are doing and want to override just edit the check out of SetupMinecraft.sh but otherwise just run it as ./SetupMinecraft.sh normally.</li>
    <li>Fixed a nasty bug that could cause start.sh and stop.sh to disapper (thanks Paul and James).  This was related to log pruning and not having a hard path.  If you downloaded the SetupMinecraft script in the past 3 days update and try again here and you'll be set!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>December 15th 2020</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Resource packs (including ones that optionally enable RTX support) are working</li>
    <li>Guide available at <a href=""https://jamesachambers.com/minecraft-bedrock-server-resource-pack-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://jamesachambers.com/minecraft-bedrock-server-resource-pack-guide/</a></li>

    <li>Updated depends.zip</li>
  </ul>
  <li>December 10th 2020</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Cleaned up documentation</li>

    <li>Choose the folder name and port for the server in SetupMinecraft.sh (must be unique per server instance)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>May 23rd 2019</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed typo in restart.sh where there was a space after stop command preventing the server from closing cleanly</li>
    <li>Added 10 second sleep after a force close to give the server time to fully close before calling start.sh</li>
    <li>Fixed server not restarting after scheduled nightly reboot (related to restart.sh bug)</li>

## About this Repository

This is the repository of the project for translating Minecraft mods into simplified Chinese, currectly using a platform called Weblate which is similar to Crowdin.<br>
This project aims to deal with certain problems where localizations are not accepted in time or simply fail to be accepted.<br>
If you want to join us, please visit our official website and learn more:<br>
### <https://cfpa.team>

It is also fine to submit pull requests to this repository.

Before you start, check the important tips from us here: [*Regulations and Guidelines for Simplified Chinese Translation of Minecraft Mods*](https://github.com/Meow-J/Mod-Translation-Styleguide/blob/master/README.md).

## Usage

Download the *released* version [here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/simplified-chinese-localization-resource-package) or the *snapshot* version [here](https://github.com/CFPAOrg/Minecraft-Mod-Language-Package/releases/latest).<br>
To apply, simply load this pack like any other resource pack. In case of some issues, restarting Minecraft after loading is recommended.

## Related Information

**How does the current localization project look like? Can I submit my list of mods that I want them to be translated?**<br>
Currently, according to the popularity on CurseForge, we have chosen Minecraft 1.12.2 for the majority of our work, with over 1000 mods in the project. If you want any other mod to be translated, you can suggest through our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CFPAOrg/Minecraft-Mod-Language-Package/issues), or email us directly.<br>

We have been propagating this project on [the MCBBS page](http://www.mcbbs.net/thread-774087-1-1.html).

The history of this project can be seen in [TartaricAcid's blog](https://baka943.coding.me/2018/01/03/2018-01-03-AnIntroForWeblate/).

**How did you guys set up the workflow?**<br>
Ummmm, it's easy though:<br>

- Get the popular mods on CurseForge with the web scraper.
- Push the files to the GitHub repository with scripts
- Pull the updates from GitHub to Weblate automatically when detecting changes in the repository.
- The translators translate on Weblate, and Weblate push the changes to GitHub automatically.
- Github Actions builds and packs automatically when detecting changes in the repository.
- Github Actions publish packs to the GitHub release automatically so that the packs can be downloaded.

Please note that Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios(Microsoft) where players interact with a fully modifiable three-dimensional environment made of blocks and entities.  And this project is a tutorial that shows how to make a game like Minecraft using Unity and DOTS technologies.

Packages needed:
Entities 1.0.0-exp.8
Entities graphics 1.0.0-exp.8
Unity Physics 1.0.0-exp.8

Unity Version:
2022.2.0b10

It's been 4 years since last time I update this project. and I hope you can learn some Unity DOTS technologies from it! Enjoy it!

12,docker/dockercraft,Lua,"# Dockercraft

![Dockercraft](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/logo.png?raw=true)

A simple Minecraft Docker client, to visualize and manage Docker containers.

![Dockercraft](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/dockercraft.gif?raw=true)

[YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZDlJgJf55o)

> WARNING: Please use Dockercraft on your local machine only.
> It currently doesn't support authentication.
> Every player should be considered a root user! 

## How to run Dockercraft

1. **Install Minecraft: [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net)**

	The Minecraft client hasn't been modified, just get the official release.

2. **Pull or build Dockercraft image:** (an official image will be available soon)

	```
	docker pull gaetan/dockercraft
	```
	or

	```
	git clone git@github.com:docker/dockercraft.git
	docker build -t gaetan/dockercraft dockercraft
	```
3. **Run Dockercraft container:**

	```
	docker run -t -i -d -p 25565:25565 \
	-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
	--name dockercraft \
	gaetan/dockercraft
	```

	Mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` inside the container is necessary to send requests to the Docker remote API.

	The default port for a Minecraft server is *25565*, if you prefer a different one: `-p <port>:25565`

4. **Open Minecraft > Multiplayer > Add Server**

	The server address is the IP of Docker host. No need to specify a port if you used the default one.

	If you're using [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/): `docker-machine ip <machine_name>`

5. **Join Server!**

	You should see at least one container in your world, which is the one hosting your Dockercraft server.

	You can start, stop and remove containers interacting with levers and buttons. Some Docker commands are also supported directly via Minecraft's chat window, which is displayed by pressing the `T` key (default) or `/` key.
	
> A command always starts with a `/`.
> 
> If you open the prompt using the `/` key, it will be prefilled with a `/` character, but if you open it with the `T` key, it will not be prefilled and you will have to type a `/` yourself before typing your docker command.
> 
> example: `/docker run redis`.

![Dockercraft](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/landscape.png?raw=true)

## Customizing Dockercraft

Do you find the plains too plain?
If so, you are in luck!

Dockercraft can be customised to use any of the [Biomes](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/blob/7f8a4eb7264a12ca2035b4e4d412485e01f309d4/src/BiomeDef.cpp#L17) and [Finishers](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/blob/7f8a4eb7264a12ca2035b4e4d412485e01f309d4/src/Generating/ComposableGenerator.cpp#L299) supported by Cuberite!

You can pass these additional arguments to your `docker run` command:
```
docker run -t -i -d -p 25565:25565 \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --name dockercraft \
    gaetan/dockercraft <biome> <groundlevel> <sealevel> <finishers>
```

Here are some examples:

**Do you long for the calm of the oceans?**
![oceans](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/ocean.png?raw=true)

Try `Ocean 50 63`, or for a more frozen alternative, `FrozenOcean 50 63 Ice`

**Or perhaps the heat of the desert?**
![desert](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/desert.png?raw=true)

Then `Desert 63 0 DeadBushes` is what you need

**Are you pining for the... Pines?**
![forest](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/forest.png?raw=true)
We have you covered. Try `Forest 63 0 Trees`

**Or maybe you are looking for fun and games?**
![jungle](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/jungle.png?raw=true)
If so, Welcome to the Jungle. `Jungle 63 0 Trees`

## Upcoming features

This is just the beginning for Dockercraft! We should be able to support a lot more Docker features like:

- List [Docker Machines](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) and use portals to see what's inside
- Support more Docker commands
- Display [logs](https://docs.docker.com/v1.8/reference/commandline/logs/) (for each container, pushing a simple button)
- Represent links
- Docker networking
- Docker volumes
- ...

If you're interested about Dockercraft's design, discussions happen in [that issue](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/issues/19).
Also, we're using [Magicavoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) to do these nice prototypes:

![Dockercraft](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/voxelproto.jpg?raw=true)

You can find our Magicavoxel patterns in [that folder](![Dockercraft](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/tree/master/docs/magicavoxel)).

To get fresh news, follow our Twitter account: [@dockercraft](https://twitter.com/dockercraft).

## How it works

The Minecraft client itself remains unmodified. All operations are done server side.

The Minecraft server we use is [http://cuberite.org](http://cuberite.org). A custom Minecraft compatible game server written in C++. [github repo](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite)

This server accepts plugins, scripts written in Lua. So we did one for Docker. (world/Plugins/Docker)

Unfortunately, there's no nice API to communicate with these plugins. But there's a webadmin, and plugins can be responsible for ""webtabs"".

```lua
Plugin:AddWebTab(""Docker"",HandleRequest_Docker)
```

Basically it means the plugin can catch POST requests sent to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/webadmin/Docker/Docker`.

### Goproxy

Events from the Docker remote API are transmitted to the Lua plugin by a small daemon (written in Go). (go/src/goproxy)

```go
func MCServerRequest(data url.Values, client *http.Client) {
	req, _ := http.NewRequest(""POST"", ""http://127.0.0.1:8080/webadmin/Docker/Docker"", strings.NewReader(data.Encode()))
	req.Header.Set(""Content-Type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"")
	req.SetBasicAuth(""admin"", ""admin"")
	client.Do(req)
}
```

The goproxy binary can also be executed with parameters from the Lua plugin, to send requests to the daemon:

```lua
function PlayerJoined(Player)
	-- refresh containers
	r = os.execute(""goproxy containers"")
end
```

14,Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge,C++,"# MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge

I challenged myself to see if I could create Minecraft in just one week... So lets go!

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq3isov6mZ8

Note: I continued to edit after the 7 days, however the version seen in the video is found here https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge/tree/eb01640580cc5ad403f6a8b9fb58af37e2f03f0c

And the ""optimized"" version can be found here: https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge/tree/792df07e9780b444be5290fd05a3c8598aacafc8 (~1 week later version) 

There also is a version of this game with very good graphics, and things like a day/night cycle. However, it was causing rendering issues for many people. This version can be found here:
https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge/tree/aa50ad8077ef0e617a9cfc336bdb7db81c313017

## Other People's Projects

This was made in a week, as a challenge for a video. There do exist other, more mature and developed Minecraft clones written in C++.

MineTest here: https://github.com/minetest/minetest

## Building

You will need GLM and SFML 2.4.1+ libraries w/headers, and this also requires a compiler that supports C++14 (or newer) with threads.

### macOS

Install macports from https://www.macports.org 

`sudo port install sfml glm`

### Ubuntu

`sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev libglm-dev`

## Compile Source and Runnimg

### Linux

#### Debug

```sh
sh scripts/build.sh
sh scripts/run.sh
```

#### Release

```sh
sh scripts/build.sh release
sh scripts/run.sh release
```

## The Challenge

### Day One

End of day one commit: https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge/tree/44ace72573833796da05a97972be5765b05ce94f

The first day was spent setting up boilerplate code such as the game state/ game screen system, and the basic rendering engines, starting off with a mere quad.

The day was finished off by creating a first person camera.

The second day was spent setting up the basic ChunkSection and various block classes.

I also worked out the coordinates for a cube, and thus created a cube renderer.

I finished up the day attempting to create a mesh builder for the chunk; however, this did not go well at all, and two had ended before I got it to work correctly.

To start the day off, I fixed the chunk drawing. Turns out I was telling OpenGL the indices were ```GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE```, but they were actually ```GL_UNSIGNED_INT```. This took 3 hours to work out...

![gl bytesss](http://i.imgur.com/PD44aRg.png)

Anyways, after this I got the game working with more chunks. I now have an area of 16x16 chunks, made out of chunk sections of 16x16x16 blocks.

To finish the day off, I got some naive block editing to work.

### Day 4

The first thing I did on day 4 was create a sky box using OpenGL cube maps.

After this, I started work on the world generation, eg adding height map and trees.

### Day 5

I started off the day by cleaning up some of the chunk code, and then proceeded to make the world infinite, but
I felt it was not needed, so I simply went back to a fixed-sized world.

I then added an item system. My implementation probably was not great for this, but it was my first time
at creating that sort of the thing.

Basically, when a player breaks a block, it gets added to their inventory. When they place a block, a block
is placed.

### Day 6

Mostly optimizations, such as view-frustum culling and making the mesh building faster.

### Day 7

Focus on improving how it looks, eg adding directional lighting

Also implemented concurency :)

15,EngineHub/WorldEdit,Java,"<h1>
    <img src=""worldedit-logo.svg"" alt=""WorldEdit"" width=""400"" /> 
</h1>

**A Minecraft Map Editor... that runs in-game!**

* With selections, schematics, copy and paste, brushes, and scripting!
* Use it in creative, survival in single player or on your server.
* Use it on your Minecraft server to fix grieving and mistakes.

Java Edition required. WorldEdit is compatible with Forge, Fabric, Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, and Sponge.

## Download WorldEdit

This place contains the Java code for WorldEdit, but if you want to just use WorldEdit, get the mod or plugin from these pages:

* For the mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit
* For the server plugin: https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit

Edit the Code
---------

Want to add new features to WorldEdit or fix bugs yourself? You can get the game running, with WorldEdit, from the code here, without any additional outside steps, by doing the following *four* things:

1. Download WorldEdit's source code and put it somewhere. We recommend you use something called Git if you already know how to use it, but [you can also just download a .zip file](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEdit/archive/master.zip). (If you plan on contributing the changes, you will need to figure out Git.)
2. Install any version of Java greater than or equal to 16.
   * Note that if you do _not_ install JDK 16 exactly, Gradle will download it for you on first run. However, it is still required to have some form of Java installed for Gradle to start at all.
3. Open terminal / command prompt / bash and navigate to the directory where you put the source code.
4. Run **one** of these following commands:
   * Mac OS X / Linux: `./gradlew :worldedit-fabric:runClient`
   * Windows - Command Prompt: `gradlew :worldedit-fabric:runClient`
   * Windows - PowerShell: `.\gradlew :worldedit-fabric:runClient`

🎉 That's it. 🎉 It takes a long time to actually transform WorldEdit into a mod. If it succeeds, **the Minecraft game will open and you can create a single player world with WorldEdit**.

When you make changes to the code, you have to restart the game by re-running the command for your changes to take effect. If there are errors in your Java syntax, the command will fail.

For additional information about compiling WorldEdit, see [COMPILING.md](COMPILING.md).

### Using a Java IDE

To edit WorldEdit in a Java IDE, follow these steps:

1. Download and install [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
2. In the IDE, open the folder that you saved WorldEdit's code in. This creates a new project in IDEA.

That's pretty much it.

If you want to be able to run the game also, follow these instructions:

1. Go to Run -> Edit Configurations.
2. Add a Gradle task:
   1. Choose `worldedit-fabric` for the project.
   2. For the tasks, type in `runClient`
3. Click OK
4. Under the Run menu again, go to ""Debug [your new task]"".

### Speeding up the Edit-Test-Edit-Test Cycle

It's a little annoying have to restart the game to test your changes. The best way to reduce the time is to run the server instead (using `runServer` instead of `runClient`) and then reconnect to the server after restarting it.

Submitting Your Changes
------------

WorldEdit is open source (specifically licensed under GPL v3), so note that your contributions will also be open source. The best way to submit a change is to create a fork on GitHub, put your changes there, and then create a ""pull request"" on our WorldEdit repository.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for important guidelines to follow.

# Mekanism for Minecraft 1.19 #

Mekanism is an independent Minecraft add-on featuring high-tech machinery that can be used to create powerful tools, 
armor, and weapons. You can find more detail on the features on the [**Official Website**](http://aidancbrady.com/mekanism/).
With features ranging from jetpacks and balloons to factories and energy cubes, the mod does not have a single unifying goal.
Nevertheless, these features combine coherently to create a rich gameplay experience that players will enjoy.

Mekanism uses a tier-based system to organize the majority of its core features, like energy cubes and factories.
There are four tiers: basic, advanced, elite, and ultimate. Players can upgrade their components to the next tier
by placing each component in a crafting grid and surrounding it with the necessary resources for the upgrade or in
world by using tier installers.

After using Mekanism for a while, players can obtain a near-indestructible suit of Refined Obsidian Armor, receive five 
ingots for each ore mined, fly with hydrogen-powered jetpacks, and have cute robotic friends following them around while they mine. :)

# Discord #

Mekanism has a [discord server](https://discord.gg/nmSjMGc) where you can chat with other Mekanism users and the developers. Join us!

19,ddevault/TrueCraft,C#,"You've downloaded TrueCraft, an open source implementation of Minecraft beta
1.7.3. Please note that TrueCraft is still experimental, and is likely to
include bugs and unfinished features.

                           === Running TrueCraft ===

On Windows, double click `TrueCraft.Launcher.exe`. This will allow you to play
singleplayer and connect to multiplayer servers.

On Linux and OS X, run `mono TrueCraft.Launcher.exe` from a terminal.

                            === Running Servers ===

You've also been given the TrueCraft server. If you want to run a server to play
with your friends, you will need to forward port 25565 on your router.

Run `TrueCraft.exe` to host a server. On Linux and OS X, you can run `mono
TrueCraft.exe` to host the server.

If you do not want to host the server yourself, try https://gamocosm.com.

                           === Updating TrueCraft ===

TrueCraft is updated all the time. Download new versions from:

https://truecraft.io

Eventually TrueCraft will update itself automatically. Until then, you'll have
to update it yourself manually.

                               === Community ===

You aren't the only one playing TrueCraft! Come hang out with us:

* /r/truecraft
* #truecraft on irc.esper.net

                              === Source Code ===

## Data quality

Minecraft data provides scripts to audit the data, they can be useful to check the data is correct :

 * [audit_blocks](tools/js/test/audit_blocks.js)
 * [audit_items](tools/js/test/audit_items.js)
 * [audit_recipes](tools/js/test/audit_recipes.js)
 * [audit_shapes](tools/js/test/audit_shapes.js)

Minecraft data also provides json schemas in enums_schemas/ that are used in
test/test.js to check the json file are valid relative to these schemas.
These schemas can also be used to understand better how the json files are
formatted in order to use it.

23,xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query,PHP,"# PHP Minecraft Query [![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/xpaw/php-minecraft-query.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/xpaw/php-minecraft-query)

This library can be used to query Minecraft servers for some basic information.

**:warning: Please do not create issues when you are unable to retrieve information from a server, unless you can prove that there is a bug within the library.**

## Differences between Ping and Query

There are two methods of retrieving information about a Minecraft server.

### Ping
Ping protocol was added in Minecraft 1.7 and is used to query the server for minimal amount of information (hostname, motd, icon, and a sample of players). This is easier to use and doesn't require extra setup on server side. It uses TCP protocol on the same port as you would connect to your server.

`MinecraftPing` class contains a method `QueryOldPre17` which can be used to query servers on version 1.6 or older.

### Query
This method uses GameSpy4 protocol, and requires enabling `query` listener in your `server.properties` like this:

> *enable-query=true*<br>
> *query.port=25565*

Query allows to request a full list of servers' plugins and players, however this method is more prone to breaking, so if you don't need all this information, stick to the ping method as it's more reliable.

## RCON
It is possible to send console commands to a Minecraft server remotely using the [Source RCON protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol). Use [PHP Source Query](https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Source-Query-Class) library for your RCON needs.

## SRV DNS record
This library automatically tries to resolve SRV records. If you do not wish to do so, pass `false` as the fourth param in the constructor (after timeout param).

## Example
```php
<?php
	require __DIR__ . '/src/MinecraftPing.php';
	require __DIR__ . '/src/MinecraftPingException.php';
	
	use xPaw\MinecraftPing;
	use xPaw\MinecraftPingException;
	
	try
	{
		$Query = new MinecraftPing( 'localhost', 25565 );
		
		print_r( $Query->Query() );
	}
	catch( MinecraftPingException $e )
	{
		echo $e->getMessage();
	}
	finally
	{
		if( $Query )
		{
			$Query->Close();
		}
	}
?>
```

If you want to get `ping` info from a server that uses a version older than Minecraft 1.7,
then use function `QueryOldPre17` instead of `Query`.

----

If the server has query enabled (`enable-query`), then you can use `MinecraftQuery` to more retrieve information about a server.
```php
<?php
	require __DIR__ . '/src/MinecraftQuery.php';
	require __DIR__ . '/src/MinecraftQueryException.php';
	
	use xPaw\MinecraftQuery;
	use xPaw\MinecraftQueryException;
	
	$Query = new MinecraftQuery( );
	
	try
	{
		$Query->Connect( 'localhost', 25565 );
		
		print_r( $Query->GetInfo( ) );
		print_r( $Query->GetPlayers( ) );
	}
	catch( MinecraftQueryException $e )
	{
		echo $e->getMessage( );
	}
?>
```

For Bedrock servers (MCPE) use `ConnectBedrock` function instead of `Connect`, then `GetInfo` will work.

Geyser is a bridge between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition, closing the gap from those wanting to play true cross-platform.

Geyser is an open collaboration project by [CubeCraft Games](https://cubecraft.net).

## What is Geyser?
Geyser is a proxy, bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition servers.
The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible. However, due to the nature of Geyser translating packets over the network of two different games, *do not expect everything to work perfectly!*

Special thanks to the DragonProxy project for being a trailblazer in protocol translation and for all the team members who have joined us here!

### Currently supporting Minecraft Bedrock 1.19.20 - 1.19.51 and Minecraft Java 1.19.3.

## Setting Up
Take a look [here](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/setup/) for how to set up Geyser.

- Donate: https://opencollective.com/geysermc
- Test Server: `test.geysermc.org` port `25565` for Java and `19132` for Bedrock

## What's Left to be Added/Fixed
- Near-perfect movement (to the point where anticheat on large servers is unlikely to ban you)
- Some Entity Flags
- Structure block UI

## What can't be fixed
There are a few things Geyser is unable to support due to various differences between Minecraft Bedrock and Java. For a list of these limitations, see the [Current Limitations](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/current-limitations/) page.

## Compiling
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Navigate to the Geyser root directory and run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. This command downloads all the needed submodules for Geyser and is a crucial step in this process.
3. Run `gradlew build` and locate to `bootstrap/build` folder.

这是用Python和Pyglet写的简单的Minecraft游戏，
从<https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft>fork过来的，
一共只有几百行代码，麻雀虽小，五脏俱全，觉得挺有意思的，
于是把源码读了一遍，并做了详细的注释。
通过这个例子学习Pyglet和Python游戏编程还是不错的，推荐。

以下是游戏视频：

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC3lwK631X8

## How to Run

    pip install pyglet
    git clone https://github.com/Hawstein/PyMinecraft.git
    cd PyMinecraft
    python main.py

在windows和mac下，pyglet还不支持64 python，对于64 mac，可以试一下：

	export VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes
    arch -i386 python main.py
	
或者使用支持64位的Pyglet 1.2：

	pip install https://pyglet.googlecode.com/files/pyglet-1.2alpha1.tar.gz

27,jkutner/heroku-buildpack-minecraft,Shell,"# Heroku Minecraft Buildpack

This is a [Heroku Buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks)
for running a Minecraft server in a [dyno](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos).

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Usage

Create a [free ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/) and copy your Auth token. Then create a new Git project with a `eula.txt` file:

```sh-session
$ echo 'eula=true' > eula.txt
$ git init
$ git add eula.txt
$ git commit -m ""first commit""
```

Then, install the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/).
Create a Heroku app, set your ngrok token, and push:

```sh-session
$ heroku create
$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/python
$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/jvm
$ heroku buildpacks:add jkutner/minecraft
$ heroku config:set NGROK_API_TOKEN=""xxxxx""
$ git push heroku master
```

Finally, open the app:

```sh-session
$ heroku open
```

This will display the ngrok logs, which will contain the name of the server
(really it's a proxy, but whatever):

```
Server available at: 0.tcp.ngrok.io:17003
```

Copy the `0.tcp.ngrok.io:17003` part, and paste it into your local Minecraft app
as the server name.

## Syncing to S3

The Heroku filesystem is [ephemeral](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem),
which means files written to the file system will be destroyed when the server is restarted.

Minecraft keeps all of the data for the server in flat files on the file system.
Thus, if you want to keep you world, you'll need to sync it to S3.

First, create an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) and an S3 bucket. Then configure the bucket
and your AWS keys like this:

```
$ heroku config:set AWS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
$ heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
$ heroku config:set AWS_SECRET_KEY=xxx
```

The buildpack will sync your world to the bucket every 60 seconds, but this is configurable by setting the `AWS_SYNC_INTERVAL` config var.

## Connecting to the server console

The Minecraft server runs inside a `screen` session. You can use [Heroku Exec](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-exec) to connect to your server console.

Once you have Heroku Exec installed, you can connect to the console using

```
$ heroku ps:exec
Establishing credentials... done
Connecting to web.1 on ⬢ lovely-minecraft-2351...
$ screen -r minecraft
```

**WARNING** You are now connected to the Minecraft server. Use `Ctrl-A Ctrl-D` to exit the screen session.
(If you hit `Ctrl-C` while in the session, you'll terminate the Minecraft server.)

## Customizing

### ngrok

You can customize ngrok by setting the `NGROK_OPTS` config variable. For example:

```
$ heroku config:set NGROK_OPTS=""--remote-addr 1.tcp.ngrok.io:25565""
```

### Minecraft

You can choose the Minecraft version by setting the MINECRAFT_VERSION like so:

```
$ heroku config:set MINECRAFT_VERSION=""1.18.1""
```

You can also configure the server properties by creating a `server.properties`
file in your project and adding it to Git. This is how you would set things like
Creative mode and Hardcore difficulty. The various options available are
described on the [Minecraft Wiki](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties).

You can add files such as `banned-players.json`, `banned-ips.json`, `ops.json`,
`whitelist.json` to your Git repository and the Minecraft server will pick them up.

### Adding New Minecraft Versions

Please submit Pull Requests to [`etc/files.json`](https://github.com/jkutner/heroku-buildpack-minecraft/blob/master/etc/files.json)

### Using the Buildpack from source

If you want the bleeding edge version of this buildpack run:

```
$ heroku buildpacks:remove jkutner/minecraft
$ heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/jkutner/heroku-buildpack-minecraft
```

ScriptCraft lets you write Minecraft Mods using Javascript - a
programming language that's relatively easy to learn and use.
ScriptCraft is a Minecraft Server plugin which means it must be used
with a Minecraft server. Once you've downloaded and installed the
Minecraft Server, then installed the ScriptCraft Plugin you can write
your own Minecraft mods using Javascript.

I created ScriptCraft to make it easier for younger programmers to
create their own Minecraft Mods. Mods are written using the
JavaScript programming language. Once the ScriptCraft mod is
installed, you can add your own new Mods by adding JavaScript (.js)
files in a directory.

 * If you're new to programming and want to start modding Minecraft, then [Start Here][yp].
 * If you've already used [Scratch][scr], have attended a few
   [CoderDojo][cd] sessions, or have already dabbled with JavaScript,
   then [Start Here][cda].
 * Watch some [demos][ytpl] of what you can do with ScriptCraft.

This is a simple mod in a file called greet.js in the scriptcraft/plugins directory:

```javascript
function greet( player ) {
  echo( player, 'Hello ' + player.name );
}
exports.greet = greet;
```

At the in-game prompt, type:

```javascript
/js greet(self)
```

Anything you can do using the Spigot or CanaryMod APIs in Java,
you can do using ScriptCraft in JavaScript.

# Description

ScriptCraft is a plugin for Minecraft Servers which lets operators,
administrators and plug-in authors customize the game using
JavaScript.  ScriptCraft makes it easier to create your own mods. Mods
can be written in Javscript and can use the full [SpigotMC
API][spigot] or [CanaryMod API][cm]. ScriptCraft works with all of the
following Minecraft Server software:

* [SpigotMC][spigot] (Recommended)
* [GlowStone][gs] 
* [CanaryMod][cm] 

[spigot]: http://www.spigotmc.org/
[gs]: http://www.glowstone.net/
[cm]: http://canarymod.net/

I recommend using SpigotMC because both CanaryMod and CraftBukkit are
no longer being actively developed. The ScriptCraft mod also lets you
enter javascript commands at the in-game prompt.  To bring up the
in-game prompt press the `/` key then type `js ` followed by any
javascript statement.  For example: `/js 1 + 1` will print 2.

ScriptCraft also includes many objects and functions to make building
and modding easier using JavaScript. The JavaScript `Drone` object
bundled with ScriptCraft provides an easy way to build at-scale in
Minecraft. See the attached [temple.js][temple] file for an example
of how you can use the sample Drone plugin to create new buildings in
Minecraft.

[cottage]: https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/tree/master/src/main/js/plugins/drone/contrib/cottage.js
[temple]: https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/src/main/js/plugins/drone/contrib/temple.js
[bukkit]: http://dl.bukkit.org/

# Prerequisites

ScriptCraft is a Minecraft Server Mod which only works with Minecraft
for Personal computers (Windows, Mac and Linux). It does not work with
X-BOX, Playstation or WiiU versions of the game. You will need to have
Java version 7 or later installed. Check the version by typing `java 
-version` at a command prompt.

# Installation

Before installing ScriptCraft you must first install SpigotMC which is
a special version of Minecraft Server that makes it easy to customize
the game.

## Installing and Running SpigotMC

Follow these steps to download and install SpigotMC.

1. Download Spigot's [BuildTools.jar][spigotdl] 
2. Save the BuildTools.jar file to a new directory called spigotmc.
3. Open a terminal (Mac and Linux) or command prompt (windows) window and type `java -jar BuildTools.jar`. This will kick off a long series of commands to ""build"" SpigotMC.
4. When the build is done, there will be a new file beginning with `spigot` and ending in `.jar` in the spigotmc directory. Run this file by typing `java -jar spigot-1.10.2.jar` (it might not be that exact name - you can list files in the directory by typing `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Mac and Linux).
5. The server will start up then shut down very shortly afterwards. You'll need to edit a file called `eula.txt` - change `eula=false` to `eula=true` and save the file.
6. Run the `java -jar spigot-1.10.2.jar` command again - this time the server will start up. Shut it down by typing `stop` at the server prompt.

## Installing ScriptCraft

Follow these steps to download and install ScriptCraft.

1. Download the [scriptcraft.jar][dl] plugin and save it to the `plugins` directory and restart the server by typing `java -jar spigot-1.10.2.jar`.
2. At the server prompt type `js 1 + 1` and hit enter. The result `2` should be displayed. 

Congratulations - you've just installed your Custom Minecraft Server and are ready to begin writing your first mod!

# Post Install

Once installed, a new scriptcraft/plugins directory is automatically
created.  All files in the scriptcraft/plugins directory will be
automatically loaded when the server starts.  *Only players who are
ops can use this plugin.* You can grant a player `op` privileges by
typing 'op <username>' (replacing <username> with your own Minecraft
user name) at the server console prompt or by adding the player's
username to the ops.txt file in your server directory.

Launch the server, then launch the Minecraft client and create a new
server connection. The IP address will be `localhost` . Once you've
connected to your server and have entered the game, look at a
ground-level block and type:

    /js up().box( blocks.wool.black, 4, 9, 1 )

&hellip; This will create a black monolith structure 4 blocks wide by 9
blocks high by 1 block long.  Take a look at the
src/main/javascript/drone/drone.js file to see what ScriptCraft's
drone can do.  

If you're interested in customizing minecraft beyond just creating new buildings, take a look at [the homes mod][homes] for an example of how to create a more fully-featured JavaScript plugin for Minecraft.

## Your first mod - Howling blocks
Listed below is a simple mod that will make blocks 'Howl' when they're broken. 

``` javascript
// copy and paste this code to a new file named 'scriptcraft/plugins/howling-blocks.js'
var sounds = require('sounds');
function howl(event){
  sounds.entityWolfHowl( event.block );
}
events.blockBreak( howl );
``` 

If you're using CanaryMod instead of SpigotMC you can [download the equivalent code](https://gist.github.com/walterhiggins/69cddd15160d803fb096).

A JavaScript mod for minecraft is just a JavaScript source file (.js)
located in the scriptcraft/plugins directory. All .js files in this
directory will be automatically loaded when the server starts. 

To get started writing your own mod, take a look at some of the
[examples][examples].

[homes]: src/main/js/plugins/homes/homes.js
[examples]: src/main/js/plugins/examples/

# Additional information

Because the SpigotMC API is open, all of the SpigotMC API is accessible
via javascript once the ScriptCraft plugin is loaded. There are a
couple of useful Java objects exposed via javascript in the
ScriptCraft plugin:

 * `__plugin` &ndash; the ScriptCraft Plugin itself. This is a useful
   starting point for accessing other SpigotMC objects. The `__plugin`
   object is of type [org.bukkit.plugin.Plugin][api] and all
   of its properties and methods are accessible. For example: `js
   __plugin.name` returns the plugin's name
   (JavaScript is more concise than the equivalent Java code:
   `__plugin.getName()` ).

 * `server` &ndash; The top-level org.bukkit.Server object. See the [SpigotMC API docs][spigotapi] for reference.

 * `self` &ndash; The player/command-block or server console operator who
   invoked the `/js` command. Again, this is a good jumping off point for
   diving into the SpigotMC API.

# Bukkit Configuration 
## (You can ignore this if using CanaryMod)

ScriptCraft works with Bukkit Plugin and uses the Bukkit Configuration
API. On first loading, ScriptCraft will create a config.yml file in
the plugins/scriptcraft/ directory. This file looks like this:

    extract-js:
      plugins: true
      modules: true
      lib: true

This file allows scriptcraft admins to turn on or off re-unzipping of the `modules`,
`plugins` and `lib` folders when deploying a new version of
ScriptCraft. It's strongly recommended that the `lib` directory always
be set to true to get the latest core ScriptCraft code . The modules
and plugins directories are optional and not part of ScriptCraft core.

## Quick Start
Too much text for you?  Click the `cdk` folder in the source above for a fast and relatively-automated walkthrough.

## Background

Instead of paying a minecraft hosting service for a private server for you and your friends, host it yourself. By utilizing several AWS services, a minecraft server can automatically start when you're ready to use it, and shut down when you are done. The final cost will depend on use but can be as little as a a dollar or two per month. The cost estimate breakdown is below.

This is a _reasonably_ cost effective solution for someone that doesn't need their server running 24/7. If that's you, read on!

## Workflow

The process works as follows:

1. Open Minecraft Multiplayer, let it look for our server, it will time out.
2. The DNS lookup query is logged in Route 53 on our public hosted zone.
3. CloudWatch forwards the query to a Lambda function.
4. The Lambda function modifies an existing ECS Fargate service to a desired task count of 1.
5. Fargate launches two containers, Minecraft and a watchdog, which updates the DNS record to the new IP
6. The watchdog optionally sends a text message through Twilio and/or publishes to an SNS topic when the server is ready.
7. Refresh Minecraft server list, server is ready to connect.
8. After 10 minutes without a connection or 20 minutes after the last client disconnects (customizable) the watchdog sets the desired task count to zero and shuts down.

## Diagram

![Basic Workflow](docs/diagrams/aws_architecture.drawio.png)

## Requirements

- AWS Account
- Domain name with public [DNS served from Route 53]. Does not need to be registered through Route 53.
- Minecraft Java edition OR Bedrock edition client
- Use of the excellent [Minecraft Java Docker] or [Minecraft Bedrock Docker] server image (used within task definition, no direct download required)

## Cost Breakdown

- Link to [AWS Estimate] assuming 20 hours a month usage.
- tl;dr : $0.50 per month for DNS zones, $0.0149 (one point five cents) per hour for Fargate Spot or $0.049 (four point nine cents) per hour for regular Fargate. All other costs negligible, a couple of pennies per month at most.
- tl;dr;tl;dt : $1.50 / month for 20 hours of play.

# Installation and Setup

For a quick start, a Cloud Deployment Kit (CDK) implementation is available! Click on the `cdk` folder in the source for the instructions. The documentation will be refined soon to expand on this to help novice users. What follows is a manual walkthrough that anyone should be able to complete.

## Checklist of things to keep track of

To simplify the procedure, your ECS cluster name, service name, and sns topic name need to be defined before you start. This is because we will be referencing them before they are created. In the documentation I use these:

- Cluster name : `minecraft`
- Service name : `minecraft-server`
- SNS Topic : `minecraft-notifications`

Things you need to go find because they'll be used in the procedure are:

- AWS Account ID. This is a 12 digit number (at least mine is). [Finding your AWS account ID]. Put this in the IAM policies where I've put `zzzzzzzzzzzz`
- Hosted Zone ID. This is a variable length string tied to your domain name in the Route 53 console.
- VPC IPv4 CIDR. It looks like (and very well may be) `172.31.0.0/16`. Find it by opening the VPC console, tapping on `Your VPCs` and looking in the `IPv4 CIDR` column.

Things you will locate as you go along and will need during IAM policy creation:

- EFS File System ID
- EFS Access Point ID

## Region Selection

While it doesn't matter which region you decide to run your server in, **Route 53 will only ship its logs to us-east-1**, which in turns means that the lambda function also has to be in us-east-1. This lambda function can fire off the server in another region without issue, as long as the destination region is specified within the lambda function code. For the purposes of this documentation, I'm using `us-west-2` to run my server.

Double check the region in anything you're copy/pasting.

## VPC

A VPC with Subnets must exist in order for Fargate tasks to launch and for EFS shares to be mounted. A subnet should exist in each availability zone so that Fargate (and Fargate Spot, if used) can properly launch the tasks in an AZ with plenty of capacity. A security group for our task is required but is easiest configured when setting up the Task Definition below.

A [Default VPC] should do the trick, chances are you've already got one. We'll be modifying the default security group within the EFS setup below.

## Elastic File System

EFS is where the world data and server properties are stored, and persists between runs of the minecraft server. By using an ""Access Point"" the mounted folder is created automatically, so no mounting of the EFS to an external resource is required to get up and running. To make changes to the files like `server.properties` later however, a user can either mount the EFS file system to a Linux host in their account if they're comfortable with that, or I detail another method below using AWS DataSync and S3 that anyone can use without Linux experience.

### Creating the EFS

Open the Elastic File System console and create a new file system. Believe it or not, all the defaults are fine here! It will create an EFS available in each subnet within your VPC.

Select your newly created filesystem, and tap the `Access Points` tab. Create a new access point using the following specifics:

- Details
  - Root directory path : `/minecraft`
- POSIX User
  - User ID : `1000`
  - Group ID : `1000`
- Root directory creation permissions (this is required, otherwise our container won't be able to create the folder to store its data the first time)
  - Owner user ID : `1000`
  - Owner group ID : `1000`
  - POSIX Permissions : `0755`

Click `Create access point`. Record the File System ID and the Access Point ID for our checklist. They are in the format `fs-xxxxxxxx` and `fsap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` respectively.

### Allow access to EFS from within the VPC

Our EFS by default is assigned the default security group, which allows connections from all members of that default security group. Our ECS Service will not be using the default security group however, because we are opening Minecraft to the public internet. So, we need to add EFS access to the default security group (more advanced users may want to create a new dedicated security group with this rule and assign it to the mount points within the EFS console, however that will not be described here).

Open the VPC console, find `Security Groups` on the left hand side. Select the default security group in the list, then click on `Edit inbound rules`. Add a new rule, select `NFS` in the `Type` list and put your VPC IPv4 CIDR from your checklist as the source. After clicking `Save rules` double check that it added successfully by viewing it in the `Security Groups` detail pane.

## Lambda

A lambda function must exist that turns on your minecraft service. We do this with a simple python function that change the ""Tasks Desired"" count from zero to one when it is invoked. We haven't created the ECS service yet, but that's okay, because we decided on the cluster name and service name before we started.

Because we are relying on Route 53+CloudWatch to invoke the Lambda function, it _must_ reside in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) region.

From the Lambda console, create a new function using `Author from scratch`. I've used Python 3.9 but the latest version available should be fine. Call it `minecraft-launcher`. The other defaults are fine, it will create an IAM role we will modify afterward. We do not need to specify a VPC.

Once the function has been created and you're in the code editor, replace the contents of the default lambda_function.py with this:

```python
import boto3

REGION = 'us-west-2'
CLUSTER = 'minecraft'
SERVICE = 'minecraft-server'


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """"""Updates the desired count for a service.""""""

    ecs = boto3.client('ecs', region_name=REGION)
    response = ecs.describe_services(
        cluster=CLUSTER,
        services=[SERVICE],
    )

    desired = response[""services""][0][""desiredCount""]

    if desired == 0:
        ecs.update_service(
            cluster=CLUSTER,
            service=SERVICE,
            desiredCount=1,
        )
        print(""Updated desiredCount to 1"")
    else:
        print(""desiredCount already at 1"")
```

This file is also in this repository in the `lambda` folder. Change the region, cluster, or service on lines 3-5 if needed. Then, click the `Deploy` button. Switch back to your server region now so that we don't create anything in the wrong region later.

Lambda can be very inexpensive when used sparingly. For example, this lambda function runs in about 1600ms when starting the container, and in about 500ms if the container is already online. This means, running at a 128MB memory allocation, it will cost $0.00000336 the first time the server is launched from an off state, and about $0.00000105 every time someone connects to an online server, because anyone connecting will have to perform a DNS lookup which will trigger your lambda function. If you and four friends played once a day for a month, it would come out to $0.0002583, which is 2.6% of a single penny.

## Route 53

Ensure that a domain name you own is set up in Route 53. If you don't own one, consider registering one. You can use Route 53 for convenience or go to one of the big domain providers. Either way, ensure you've got your nameservers set to host out of Route 53 as it's required for the on-demand functionality.

### Server DNS Record

Add an A record with a 30 second TTL with a unique name that you will use to connect to your minecraft server. Something like minecraft.yourdomainname.com, or more complex if desired, as every time anyone _in the world_ performs a DNS lookup on this name, your Minecraft server will launch. The value of the record is irrelevant because it will be updated every time our container launches. Use 1.1.1.1 or 192.168.1.1 for now if you can't think of anything. The low TTL is so that the DNS clients and non-authoritative DNS servers won't cache the record long and you can connect quicker after the IP updates.

### Query Logging

The magic that allows the on-demand idea to work without any ""always on"" infrastructure comes in here, with Query logging. Every time someone looks up a DNS record for your domain, it will hit Route 53 as the authoritative DNS server. These queries can be logged and actions performed from them.

From your hosted zone, click `Configure query logging` on the top right. Then, click `Grant Permission` so that it will apply appropriate policies for queries to be logged. Finally, in `Log group` select `Create log group` and use the suggested name with your domain name in the string, `/aws/route53/yourdomainname.com` and click `Create`.

## Optional SNS Notifications

You can receive a text or email or anything else you want to consume via Amazon SNS, if Twilio isn't your thing. This also allows this to be a 100% AWS solution.

From the SNS console, create a `Standard` topic called `minecraft-notifications`. Also at your convenience, create a Subscription to the topic to a destination of your choice. Email is easy and free, SMS is beyond the scope of this documentation but there's plenty of resources out there to help you set it up.

## IAM

The IAM Console is where we configure the roles and policies required to give access to the Task running the Minecraft server and the Lambda Function used to start it.

We will be creating four distinct policies and one role. The policies will then be attached to the appropriate roles.

### Policies

#### EFS Policy

This policy will allow for read/write access to our new Elastic File System Access Point. In the policy below, replace the zzz's with your account id and put your file system and access point id in the appropriate places. Change the region if necessary.

Call this policy `efs.rw.minecraft-data`

```json
{
  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
  ""Statement"": [
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": [
        ""elasticfilesystem:ClientMount"",
        ""elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite"",
        ""elasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems""
      ],
      ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-west-2:zzzzzzzzzzzz:file-system/fs-xxxxxxxx"",
      ""Condition"": {
        ""StringEquals"": {
          ""elasticfilesystem:AccessPointArn"": ""arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-west-2:zzzzzzzzzzzz:access-point/fsap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx""
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ECS Policy

This policy will allow for management of the Elastic Container Service tasks and service. This lets the Lambda function start the service, as well as allows the service to turn itself off when not in use. The `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces` section is so that the task can determine what IP address is assigned to it to properly update the DNS record.

Replace the `zzzzzzzzzzzz` below with the appriopriate account ID in your ARN. If you are not using the default cluster name or service name we decided above, change those as well. Change the region if necessary.

Call this policy `ecs.rw.minecraft-service`

```json
{
  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
  ""Statement"": [
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": [""ecs:*""],
      ""Resource"": [
        ""arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:zzzzzzzzzzzz:service/minecraft/minecraft-server"",
        ""arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:zzzzzzzzzzzz:task/minecraft/*""
      ]
    },
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": [""ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces""],
      ""Resource"": [""*""]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Route 53 Policy

This policy gives permission to our ECS task to update the DNS `A` record associated with our minecraft server. Note: This will give your container access to change _all_ records within the hosted zone, and this may not be desirable if you're using this domain for anything else outside of this purpose. If you'd like to increase security, you can create a subdomain zone of the main domain to limit the impact. This is an advanced use case and the setup is described pretty well within the answers to [Delegate Zone Setup].

Place the hosted zone identifier from our checklist and place it in the Resource line within this policy where the XXX's are.

Call this policy `route53.rw.yourdomainname`

```json
{
  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
  ""Statement"": [
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": [
        ""route53:GetHostedZone"",
        ""route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets"",
        ""route53:ListResourceRecordSets""
      ],
      ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX""
    },
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": [""route53:ListHostedZones""],
      ""Resource"": ""*""
    }
  ]
}
```

#### SNS policy (optional)

If you have decided to receive SNS notifications, we need a policy that allows publishing to the SNS topic you created.

Replace the zzz's with your account ID, and adjust the topic name or the region if you used something different.

Call this policy `sns.publish.minecraft-notifications`

```json
{
  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
  ""Statement"": [
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": ""sns:Publish"",
      ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:zzzzzzzzzzzz:minecraft-notifications""
    }
  ]
}
```

### Roles

Policies are assigned to roles, and roles are used by services to services to perform the required tasks. We are creating one new role and adjusting an existing role.

#### ECS Role

In the IAM console, select `Roles` and `Create role`. In the wizard, in the first ""Choose your use case"" dialog click `Elastic Container Service` and then for ""Select your use case"", click `Elastic Container Service Task` (last one in the list). Click `Next: Permissions`.

In the policy list, you can click `Filter policies` and select `Customer managed` to make this easier. Check the boxes for all of our created policies:

- `efs.rw.minecraft-data`
- `ecs.rw.minecraft-service`
- `route53.rw.yourdomainname`
- `sns.publish.minecraft-notifications`

Click `Next: Tags` then `Next: Review`. Call the role `ecs.task.minecraft-server` and click `Create role`.

#### Lambda Role

In the roles list, find the role created by the lambda function earlier. It will be called `minecraft-launcher-role-xxxxxxxx`. Click on it, then click `Attach policies`. Give it the `ecs.rw.minecraft-service` policy we created earlier.

## Elastic Container Service

The final task we need to do is create the ECS task, cluster, and service.

### Task Definition

Create a new Task Definition of `FARGATE` launch type. In the configuration wizard, use these options:

- Task Definition Name: `minecraft-server`
- Task Role: `ecs.task.minecraft-server`
- Network Mode: `awsvpc` (default)
- Task Execution Role: `Create new role` (default if you've never created tasks before) or `ecsTaskExecutionRole` (default otherwise). Not to be confused with the `ecs.task.minecraft-server` role we used earlier.
- Task Memory: `2GB` (good to start, increase later if needed)
- Task CPU: `1 vCPU` (good to start, increase later if needed)

Skip `Container Definitions` temporarily and scroll further down to Volumes. Click `Add volume`, call it `data`, volume type EFS. Select the filesystem id from the dropdown that we created above, the access point id we created above, and check the box for `Encryption in transit` and click Add.

Scroll back up and click `Add container`. Use defaults except for these specifics:

- Container name: `minecraft-server`
- Image:
  - For Java edition: `itzg/minecraft-server`
  - For Bedrock edition: `itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server`
- Port Mappings:
  - For Java edition: `25565 TCP`
  - For Bedrock edition: `19132 UDP`

Under `Advanced container configuration` make these changes:

- Environment
  - UNCHECK `Essential` (the watchdog container handles shutdowns)
  - Environment Variables. One gotcha, you have to select ""Value"" from the drop down list when defining these.
    - `EULA` : `TRUE`
    - Any additional stuff you want from [Minecraft Java Docker Server Docs] or [Minecraft Bedrock Docker Server Docs]
- Storage and Logging
  - Mount Points
    - Source volume : `data`
    - Container path: `/data`

Click `Add` and then click `Add container` again to add a second container to the list. Use defaults except for these specifics:

- Container name: `minecraft-ecsfargate-watchdog`
- Image: `doctorray/minecraft-ecsfargate-watchdog` (source for this container within this project if you want to build/host it yourself)

Under `Advanced container configuration` make these changes:

- Essential: YES checked (default)
- Environmental Variables (required)
  - `CLUSTER` : `minecraft`
  - `SERVICE` : `minecraft-server`
  - `DNSZONE` : Route 53 hosted zone ID from your checklist
  - `SERVERNAME` : `minecraft.yourdomainname.com`
- Environmental Variables (optional)
  - `STARTUPMIN` : Number of minutes to wait for a connection after starting before terminating (default 10)
  - `SHUTDOWNMIN` : Number of minutes to wait after the last client disconnects before terminating (default 20)
  - `SNSTOPIC` : Full ARN of your SNS topic (if using SNS)
  - `TWILIOFROM` : `+1XXXYYYZZZZ` (your twilio number)
  - `TWILIOTO` : `+1XXXYYYZZZZ` (your cell phone to get a text on)
  - `TWILIOAID` : Twilio account ID
  - `TWILIOAUTH` : Twilio auth code

If using Twilio to alert you when the server is ready and when it turns off, all four twilio variables must be specified. If publishing to an SNS topic, the `SNSTOPIC` variable must be specified.

Click `Add` and then `Create` to create the task.

### Cluster

Create a new ""Networking Only"" Cluster. Call it `minecraft`. Don't create a dedicated VPC for this, use the default or same one you already created your EFS in. Enabling Container Insights is optional but recommended for troubleshooting later, especially if you expect a lot of people to potentially connect and you want to review CPU or Memory usage.

### Service

Within your `minecraft` cluster, create a new Service.

- Configure serivce
  - Launch type: Click `Switch to capacity provider`
  - Capacity provider strategy: `Custom strategy`
  - Click `Add another provider`
  - Provider 1: You've got a choice, details in next paragraph
    - `FARGATE`: 4.9 cents per hour of use with this CPU/Memory configuration
    - `FARGATE_SPOT`: 1.49 cents per hour of use with this CPU/Memory configuration
  - Task Definition
    - Family: `minecraft-server`
    - Revision: The latest version (Don't forget to update it here if you revise your task definition later)
  - Platform version: `LATEST`
  - Cluster: `minecraft`
  - Service name: `minecraft-server` (The service name from our checklist)
  - Number of tasks: `0` (The DNS+Lambda pipeline will change this to 1 on demand)

`FARGATE_SPOT` is significantly cheaper but AWS can terminate your instance at any time if they need the capacity. The watchdog is designed to intercept this termination command and shut down safely, so it's fine to use Spot to save a few pennies, at the extremely low risk of game interruption.

Click `Next step`

- Configure Network
  - Cluster VPC: The VPC that your EFS is in (you probably only have one anyway)
  - Subnets: Pick ALL of them, one at a time (must match the Subnets that EFS was created in, which by default is all of them)
  - Security Group: Click `Edit`
    - Create new security gruop
    - Security group name: Default is fine or call it `minecraft-server`
    - Inbound rules for security group (Java edition)
      - Change `HTTP` to `Custom TCP`
      - Port range: `25565`
      - Source: `Anywhere` is fine. Customizing this to specific source IPs is beyond the scope of this document.
      - Click `Save`
    - Inbound rules for security group (Bedrock edition)
      - Change `HTTP` to `Custom UDP`
      - Port range: `19132`
      - Source: `Anywhere` is fine. Customizing this to specific source IPs is beyond the scope of this document.
      - Click `Save`
    - Auto-assign public IP: `ENABLED` (default)

Tap `Next`, `Next`, and `Create Service`.

## CloudWatch

The final step to link everything together is to configure CloudWatch to start your server when you try to connect to it.

Open the CloudWatch console and change to the `us-east-1` region. Go to `Logs` -> `Log groups` -> and find the `/aws/route53/yourdomainname.com` Log group that we created in the Route 53 Query Log Configuration. Optionally, modify the retention period to delete the logs after a few days so they don't accumulate forever.

Go to the `Subscription filters` tab, click `Create` and then `Create Lambda subscription filter`.

In the `Create Lambda subscription filter` page, use the following values:

- Lambda Function : `minecraft-launcher`
- Log format : `Other`
- Subscription filter pattern: `""minecraft.yourdomainname.com""` (or just simply `minecraft` -- this is what it's looking for to fire off the lambda)
- Subscription filter name: `minecraft`

Click `Start streaming`.

# Usage and Customization

Launch your server the first time by visiting your server name in a web browser, which won't load anything but it will trigger the actions. You can watch it start up by refreshing the ECS console page within your `minecraft` cluster. Watch the `Desired tasks` change from 0 to 1, then on the `Tasks` tab select our task and refresh until both containers say `RUNNING`. You can also go to the `Logs` tab here and refresh the container logs to see the output of the initial world creation, etc.

To use your new server, open Minecraft Multiplayer, add your new server, and join. It will fail at first if the server is not started, but then everything comes online and you can join your new world! You may notice that you don't have many permissions or ability to customize a lot of things yet, so let's dig into how to edit the relevant files!

## Option 1: Mount EFS Directly

This option is the easiest for folks that are comfortable in the Linux command line, so I'm not going to step-by-step it. But basically, launch an AWS Linux v2 AMI in EC2 with bare-minimum specs, log into it, mount the EFS Access Point, and use your favorite command line text editor to change around server.properties, the ops.json, whitelists, whatever, and then re-launch your server with the new configuration.

## Option 2: DataSync and S3

Since EFS doesn't have a convenient way to access the files outside of mounting a share to something within the VPC, we can utilize AWS DataSync to copy files in and out to a more convenient location. These instructions will use S3 as there are countless S3 clients out there you can manage files, including the AWS Console itself.

### Step 1: Create an S3 bucket

Open the S3 console and create a bucket. It must have a unique name (across ALL s3 buckets). `yourdomainname-files` works pretty well. Place it in the same region as your EFS share. I always like to enable Bucket Versioning, in case you need to reference old files or restore to a different version. Also enable Server Side Encryption (why isn't this on by default?).

### Step 2: Create an EFS -> S3 DataSync Task

Open the DataSync console and click `Create task`.

For `Source location options`, select `Create new location` with these options:

- Location type : `Amazon EFS file system`
- Region : The region your EFS is in
- EFS File System : The file system you created earlier (this is the file system itself not the access point)
- Mount path : `/minecraft` or wherever your Access Point is pointed to

Click `Next`. For `Destination location options` select `Create new location` with these options:

- Location type : `Amazon S3`
- Region : The region your bucket was created in
- S3 bucket : The bucket you created earlier
- S3 storage class : `Standard` is fine, these are really small files.
- Folder : `/minecraft`
- IAM Role : Click `Autogenerate` and it will fill this in for you.

Click `Next`. For `Task Name` consider something like `minecraft-efs-to-s3`. For the rest of the options, use these:

- Task execution configuration : Use all defaults
- Data transfer configuration
  - Data to scan : Specific files and folders (Or pick the entire location if you don't want to specify each file below)
  - Transfer mode : Transfer only data that has changed
  - Keep deleted files / Overwrite files : Keep enabled as default
  - Includes for Java edition: add three:
    - `banned-ips.json`
    - `banned-players.json`
    - `ops.json`
    - `usercache.json`
    - `whitelist.json`
    - `server.properties`
    - `server-icon.png`
  - Includes for Bedrock edition:
    - `permissions.json`
    - `whitelist.json`
    - `server.properties`
- Schedule : not scheduled, we'll run it on demand
- Task logging
  - Log level : Do not send logs to CloudWatch

Click `Next` and `Create task`.

### Step 3: Create an S3 -> EFS DataSync Task

Open the DataSync console and click `Create task`.

For `Source location options`, select `Choose an existing location` with these options:

- Region : The region your S3 bucket is in
- Existing locations : The S3 location you created in the previous step

Click `Next`. For `Destination location options` select `Choose an existing location` with these options:

- Region : The region your EFS is in
- Existing locations: The EFS location you created in the previous step

Click `Next`. For `Task Name` consider something like `minecraft-s3-to-efs`. For the rest of the options, use these:

- Task execution configuration : Use all defaults
- Data transfer configuration
  - Data to scan : Entire source location
  - Transfer mode : Transfer only data that has changed
  - Keep deleted files / Overwrite files : Keep enabled as default
  - Excludes : None necessary this time around
  - Advanced : UNCHECK ""Copy Ownership"" and ""Copy Permissions"" -- otherwise it will change/lose them under certain circumstances and you won't be able to play after changes
- Schedule : not scheduled, we'll run it on demand
- Task logging
  - Log level : Do not send logs to CloudWatch

Click `Next` and `Create task`.

### Usage and file editing

After you've launched the minecraft server successfully once, it will create files in EFS such as `server.properties`, `ops.json`, `whitelist.json` among others. From the DataSync console, you can launch the `minecraft-efs-to-s3` task, which will copy these files from the EFS share to your S3 bucket. Then you can download these files from S3 (using the console or something like [S3 Browser]), edit them on your computer, then use the same client to upload the files back to S3. Afterward, open DataSync and launch the `minecraft-s3-to-efs` task to copy the updated files back to your EFS share. Then when you launch the server again, it will see and use the new files.

Best practice would be, any time you want to make a change to always copy the latest files from EFS to S3 first while your server is off before editing them and copying them back. Otherwise you may unintentionally regress some settings.

# Testing and Troubleshooting

The easiest way to trigger your process is to perform a dns lookup, which you can simply do by trying to visit your server name in a web browser. It will fail (duh) but it will also trigger your server to start up.

## Areas of concern, what to watch

### CloudWatch

Are your DNS queries getting logged properly? Check in the log groups, hit refresh. Often takes up to 30 seconds for them to show up.

### Lambda

Is your function running? We didn't design a ""test"" functionality for it but you could!

### Elastic Container Service

Can you start your server manually by setting desired count to 1? Here's some possible jumping off points for issues:

#### Service won't launch task

Check the execution roles, and that they have the right permissions. Check the container names for typos. Check that you selected multiple subnets in the task definition, and that it's using the LATEST version. If you updated the task definition, did you update the Service to use the new task definition version?

#### Containers won't switch to RUNNING state

Check all of the above, but also ensure you're using an EFS Access Point with the specified auto-create permissions. The minecraft container will fail if it can't mount the data volume.

### Can't connect to minecraft server

Refresh. Wait a minute, especially the first launch. Check ECS to see that the containers are in the RUNNING state. Open the running task, go to the logs tab, select minecraft and see if there are any errors on the logs. Did you make sure you opened the right port (25565 TCP) to the world in the task security group?? Security groups can be edited from both the VPC and the EC2 console.

### Not getting text messages

Are your Twilio vars valid? Do you have sufficient funds on your Twilio account? Check the logs on the watchdog container for any curl errors.

## Server starts randomly?

Remember, the server starts with a DNS query automatically. So, if you've got buddies you've shared the server with, it may start up if they open their multiplayer screen to play on a different server if yours is in the list! If this is an issue, it could probably be mitigated with a more advanced CloudWatch Subscription Filter that checks against the source IP address in addition to just the domain name, with it limiting to your ISP or location.

# Other Stuff

## Concerned about cost overruns?

Set up a [Billing Alert]! You can get an email if your bill exceeds a certain amount. Set it at $5 maybe?

## Twilio setup / usage

Open a free account at [Twilio], and load it up with $10 or so of credit. You can purchase a phone number here for a small monthly fee, and pay per use text messaging. Doing this will allow the container to send you a text message when the server is available for use.

30,Ahtenus/minecraft-init,Shell,"Init script for minecraft/bukkit servers
=======================================
A init script that apart from starting and stopping the server correctly also has some extra features
for running a mincraft/craftbukkit server.

Features
--------

 * Utilization of ramdisk for world data, decreases lag when getting world chunks
 * Cleaning of server.log, a big log file slows down the server
 * Backup for worlds
 * Server updating and complete backup
 * Exclude files and directories from full backup by adding them to ""exclude.list""

Requirements
------------
screen, rsync

Access server console
=====================

	screen -r minecraft

Exit the console
	
	Ctrl+A D

Setup
=====

1. Symlink the minecraft file to `/etc/init.d/minecraft`, set the required premissions and update rc.d.

		sudo ln -s ~/minecraft-init/minecraft /etc/init.d/minecraft
		chmod 755  ~/minecraft-init/minecraft
		sudo update-rc.d minecraft defaults

2. Edit the variables in `config.example` to your needs and rename it to `config` (leaving it in the same folder as the original minecraft script)

3. Move your worlds to the folder specified by `WORLDSTORAGE`

4. Edit crontab

	As the server user:
	
		crontab -e

	Add these lines:

		#m 	h 	dom	mon	dow	command

MCLC (Minecraft Launcher Core) is a NodeJS solution for launching modded and vanilla Minecraft without having to download and format everything yourself.
Basically a core for your Electron or script based launchers.

### Getting support
Since people seem to use this, I've created a Discord server for anyone who needs to get in contact with me or get help!

### Installing

`npm i minecraft-launcher-core`

### Standard Example
```javascript
const { Client, Authenticator } = require('minecraft-launcher-core');
const launcher = new Client();

let opts = {
    clientPackage: null,
    // For production launchers, I recommend not passing 
    // the getAuth function through the authorization field and instead
    // handling authentication outside before you initialize
    // MCLC so you can handle auth based errors and validation!
    authorization: Authenticator.getAuth(""username"", ""password""),
    root: ""./minecraft"",
    version: {
        number: ""1.14"",
        type: ""release""
    },
    memory: {
        max: ""6G"",
        min: ""4G""
    }
}

launcher.launch(opts);

launcher.on('debug', (e) => console.log(e));
launcher.on('data', (e) => console.log(e));
```

#### Notes
##### Custom
If you are loading up a client outside of vanilla Minecraft or Forge (Optifine and for an example), you'll need to download the needed files yourself if you don't provide downloads url downloads like Forge and Fabric. If no version jar is specified, MCLC will default back to the normal MC jar so mods like Fabric work.
##### Installer
This runs an executable with specified launch arguments. Was used to support Forge 1.13 before ForgeWrapper.
##### Authentication
MCLC's authenticator module does not support Microsoft authentication. You will need to use a library like [MSMC](https://github.com/Hanro50/MSMC). If you want to create your own solution, the following is the authorization JSON object format.
```js
{
    access_token: '',
    client_token: '',
    uuid: '',
    name: '',
    user_properties: '{}',
    meta: {
        type: 'mojang' || 'msa',
        demo: true || false, // Demo can also be specified by adding 'is_demo_user' to the options.feature array 
        // properties only exists for specific Minecraft versions.
        xuid: '',
        clientId: ''
    }
}
```

## Quickstart

The following starts a Bedrock Dedicated Server running a default version and
exposing the default UDP port: 

```bash
docker run -d -it -e EULA=TRUE -p 19132:19132/udp itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server
```

> **NOTE**: if you plan on running a server for a longer amount of time it is highly recommended using a management layer such as [Docker Compose](#deploying-with-docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](#deploying-with-kubernetes) to allow for incremental reconfiguration and image upgrades.

## Upgrading to the latest Bedrock server version

With the `VERSION` variable set to `LATEST`, which is the default, then the Bedrock server can be upgraded by restarting the container. At every startup, the container checks for the latest version and upgrades, if needed.

## Looking for a Java Edition Server

For Minecraft Java Edition you'll need to use this image instead:

[itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server)

## Environment Variables

### Container Specific

- `EULA` (no default) : must be set to `TRUE` to 
  accept the [Minecraft End User License Agreement](https://minecraft.net/terms)
- `VERSION` (`LATEST`) : can be set to a specific server version or the following special values can be used:
  - `LATEST` : determines the latest version and can be used to auto-upgrade on container start
  - `PREVIOUS` : uses the previously maintained major version. Useful when the mobile app is gradually being upgraded across devices
  - `1.11` : the latest version of 1.11
  - `1.12` : the latest version of 1.12
  - `1.13` : the latest version of 1.13
  - `1.14` : the latest version of 1.14
  - `1.16` : the latest version of 1.16
  - otherwise any specific server version can be provided to allow for temporary bug avoidance, etc
- `UID` (default derived from `/data` owner) : can be set to a specific user ID to run the
  bedrock server process
- `GID` (default derived from `/data` owner) : can be set to a specific group ID to run the
  bedrock server process
- `PACKAGE_BACKUP_KEEP` (`2`) : how many package backups to keep

### Server Properties

The following environment variables will set the equivalent property in `server.properties`, where each [is described here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#Bedrock_Edition_3).

- `SERVER_NAME`
- `SERVER_PORT`
- `SERVER_PORT_V6`
- `GAMEMODE`
- `DIFFICULTY`
- `LEVEL_TYPE`
- `ALLOW_CHEATS`
- `MAX_PLAYERS`
- `ONLINE_MODE`
- `WHITE_LIST`
- `VIEW_DISTANCE`
- `TICK_DISTANCE`
- `PLAYER_IDLE_TIMEOUT`
- `MAX_THREADS`
- `LEVEL_NAME`
- `LEVEL_SEED`
- `DEFAULT_PLAYER_PERMISSION_LEVEL`
- `TEXTUREPACK_REQUIRED`
- `SERVER_AUTHORITATIVE_MOVEMENT`
- `PLAYER_MOVEMENT_SCORE_THRESHOLD`
- `PLAYER_MOVEMENT_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD`
- `PLAYER_MOVEMENT_DURATION_THRESHOLD_IN_MS`
- `CORRECT_PLAYER_MOVEMENT`

For example, to configure a flat, creative server instead of the default use:

```bash
docker run -d -it --name bds-flat-creative \
  -e EULA=TRUE -e LEVEL_TYPE=flat -e GAMEMODE=creative \
  -p 19132:19132/udp itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server
```

## Exposed Ports

- **UDP** 19132 : the Bedrock server port. 
  **NOTE** that you must append `/udp` when exposing the port, such as `-p 19132:19132/udp`
  
## Volumes

- `/data` : the location where the downloaded server is expanded and ran. Also contains the
  configuration properties file `server.properties`

You can create a `named volume` and use it as:

```shell
docker volume create mc-volume
docker run -d -it --name mc-server -e EULA=TRUE -p 19132:19132/udp -v mc-volume:/data itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server
```

If you're using a named volume and want the bedrock process to run as a non-root user then you will need to pre-create the volume and `chown` it to the desired user.

For example, if you want the bedrock server to run with user ID 1000 and group ID 1000, then create and chown the volume named ""bedrock"" using:

```shell script
docker run --rm -v bedrock:/data alpine chown 1000:1000 /data
```

If using `docker run` then simply reference that volume ""bedrock"" in the `-v` argument. If using a compose file, declare the volume as an external using this type of declaration:

```yaml
volumes:
  bedrock:
    external:
      name: bedrock
```

## Connecting

When running the container on your LAN, you can find and connect to the dedicated server
in the ""LAN Games"" part of the ""Friends"" tab, such as:

![](docs/example-client.jpg)

## Permissions

The Bedrock Dedicated Server requires permissions be defined with XUIDs. There are various tools to look these up online and they
are also printed to the log when a player joins. There are 3 levels of permissions and 3 options to configure each group:

- `OPS` is used to define operators on the server.  
```shell
-e OPS ""1234567890,0987654321""
```
- `MEMBERS` is used to define the members on the server.
```shell
-e MEMBERS ""1234567890,0987654321""
```
- `VISITORS` is used to define visitors on the server.
```shell
-e VISITORS ""1234567890,0987654321""
```

## Whitelist

There are two ways to handle a whitelist. The first is to set the `WHITE_LIST` environment variable to true and map in [a whitelist.json](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Whitelist.json) that is custom-crafted to the container. The other is to use the `WHITE_LIST_USERS` environment variable to list users that should be whitelisted. This list is player names. The server will look up the names and add in the XUID to match the player.

```shell
-e WHITE_LIST_USERS=""player1,player2,player3""
```

> Starting with 1.16.230.50, `ALLOW_LIST`, `ALLOW_LIST_USERS`, and the file `allowlist.json` will be used instead.

## Mods Addons 

Also known as behavior or resource packs, in order to add mods into your server you can follow these steps, tested with [OPS (One Player Sleep)](https://foxynotail.com/addons/ops/) and [bedrocktweaks](https://bedrocktweaks.net/resource-packs/)

1. Install the mcpack or mcaddon on the client side first, just to make it easier to copy the files to the server, for Windows 10 files should be located on `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_*\LocalState\games\com.mojang`.
2. Copy over the folders of the mods from either behavior_packs or resource_packs into the server's volume.
> If you want to install them without using a client you should be able to unzip the mods directly into the server's volume, .mcaddon should go into behavior_packs and .mcpack into resource_packs. Both .mcaddon and .mcpack are actually renamed .zip files.
3. On the server's volume we will need to edit `valid_known_packs.json`, you can just copy and paste the definition of another pack and replace path, uuid and version with the mod being installed, uuid and version can be found on the mod behavior or resource _packs/mod/manifest.json, path is the path to the mod's folder.
```
	{
		""file_system"" : ""RawPath"",
		""path"" : ""behavior_packs/Foxy'sOneP"",
		""uuid"" : ""5f51f7b7-85dc-44da-a3ef-a48d8414e4d5"",
		""version"" : ""3.0.0""
	}
```
4. Lastly create on the server's volume `worlds/$level-name/world_behavior_packs.json`, you'll need to add an entry for each mod like on the previous manifest.json, we only need the uuid now called pack_id and the version replacing dots with commas and double quotes with [ ].
> You can also create a `worlds/$level-name/world_resource_packs.json` but I have seen that putting both resource and behavior packs inside the same json works just fine
```
[
	{
		""pack_id"" : ""5f51f7b7-85dc-44da-a3ef-a48d8414e4d5"",
		""version"" : [ 3, 0, 0 ]
	}
]
```
5. Restart the server and the mods should be enabled now! when connecting you will get a prompt asking if you want to ""Download & Join"" or just ""Join"", You need to Download & Join if you want to actually see the new resource pack added to the server.
This prompt is exclusive to resource packs as these alter how minecraft looks while behavior packs alter how minecraft functions and don't need to be downloaded or installed on the client side.
> If you want to force the resource pack on all clients, there's an option `texturepack-required=false` in `server.properties` that should be changed to `true`.
> Resource packs can be deleted by going into Settings > Storage > Cached Data, then selecting the pack and clicking on the trash can.

For more information [FoxyNoTail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBM4UFm0rQ&t=1380s) did a video explaining the same on a server running on Windows.

For more information about managing Bedrock Dedicated Servers in general, [check out this Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/user/ProfessorValko/comments/9f438p/bedrock_dedicated_server_tutorial/).

## Executing server commands

Assuming you started container with stdin and tty enabled (such as using `-it`), you can attach to the container's console by its name or ID using:

```shell script
docker attach CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
``` 

While attached, you can execute any server-side commands, such as op'ing your player to be admin:

```
op YOUR_XBOX_USERNAME
```

When finished, detach from the server console using Ctrl-p, Ctrl-q

## Deploying with Docker Compose

The [examples](examples) directory contains [an example Docker compose file](examples/docker-compose.yml) that declares:
- a service running the bedrock server container and exposing UDP port 19132
- a volume to be attached to the service

The service configuration includes some examples of configuring the server properties via environment variables:
```yaml
environment:
  EULA: ""TRUE""
  GAMEMODE: survival
  DIFFICULTY: normal
```

From with in the `examples` directory, you can deploy the composition by using:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can follow the logs using:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f bds
```

## Deploying with Kubernetes

The [examples](examples) directory contains [an example Kubernetes manifest file](examples/kubernetes.yml) that declares:
- a peristent volume claim (using default storage class)
- a pod deployment that uses the declared PVC
- a service of type LoadBalancer

The pod deployment includes some examples of configuring the server properties via environment variables:
```yaml
env:
- name: EULA
  value: ""TRUE""
- name: GAMEMODE
  value: survival
- name: DIFFICULTY
  value: normal
```

The file is deploy-able as-is on most clusters, but has been confirmed on [Docker for Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/kubernetes/) and [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/):

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kubernetes.yml
```

You can follow the logs of the deployment using:

```bash
kubectl logs -f deployment/bds
```

# Minecraft HDL 
 
Minecraft HDL is a digital synthesis flow for minecraft redstone circuits. It is an attempt to use industry standard design tools and methods to generate digital circuits with redstone. 
 
### Example: 
 
 
This file `multiplexer4_1.v` is a 6 input - 1 output circuit that selects one of the first 4 inputs (a, b, c, d) as the output based on the value of the last 2 inputs (x, y) 
 
```verilog 
module multiplexer4_1 ( a ,b ,c ,d ,x ,y ,dout ); 
 
output dout ; 
input a, b, c, d, x, y; 
 
assign dout = (a & (~x) & (~y)) | 
     (b & (~x) & (y)) |  
     (c & x & (~y)) | 
     (d & x & y); 
endmodule 
``` 
 
When synthesized through Minecraft HDL it produces this circuit: 
 
 
![4to1mux][mux4_short] 
 
 
With the 6 inputs on the right and the single output on the left

# About 

![MHDL_FLOW][flow]

MinecraftHDL was the final undergraduate design project made by three students in the Electrical, Computer & Software Engineering department at McGill University.  
 
It is by no means bug-free or even complete; It produces objectively inferior circuits to 'hand-made' redstone designs, and is not intended to be used in modded survival. It can generate almost any verilog circuit, however only simple designs will actually be testable in-game since any moderately-complex design will end up being longer than the maximum number of blocks loaded in Minecraft. 

Additionally, we are currently unable to synthesize sequential circuits, aka any circuits with a loopback or feedback. That means no memory, no counters or any circuit that could hold a state.
 
MinecraftHDL is an educational tool to illustrate on a macro-scopic scale how microelectronic digital circuits are designed and produced. It is a great way to introduce younger audiences to the world of digital design and can also be used to illustrate the difference between software and hardware design to undergraduate engineers taking their first RTL class.

 To show how easy it is to make a circuit with MinecraftHDL here is a gif of me creating a circuit, synthesizing, and generating it in minecraft in less than a minute!

The circuit I generate above is a 2bit adder. It takes two numbers of two bits and adds them. At the end of the gif I set both input numbers to '11' which is the binary representation of the number 3. Then I move to the output and we see that O3=1, O2=1, and O1=0, this gives the binary number '110' which is indeed 6.

## For Developers

### Compiling MineColonies

IMPORTANT: Please report any issues you have, as there might be some problems with the documentation! Also make sure you know EXACTLY what you're doing! It's not our fault if your OS crashes, becomes corrupted, etc.

#### Setup Java
The Java JDK is used to compile MineColonies.

1. Download and install the Java JDK 8.
    * [Windows](https://adoptopenjdk.net/): Choose OpenJDK 8 (LTS) version and HotSpot JVM, then click the `latest release` button. After the download is complete, open the file, accept the license agreement, and in a custom setup make sure that `Add to Path` and `Set JAVA_HOME` are set to `Entire feature will be installed on your local hard drive`. Then choose `Install` and wait for the installation to finish.
    * Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
		* Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/openjdk-bin:8`
		* Archlinux: `pacman -S jdk8-openjdk`
		* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk`
		* Fedora: `yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk`
2. Open up your command line and run `javac`. If it spews out a bunch of possible options and the usage, you're good to go. If not, try the steps again.

**Troubleshooting**
If the `javac` command does not work on Windows:
* Go to `Control Panel\System and Security\System` and click on `Advanced System Settings` on the left-hand side.
* Click on `Environment Variables`.
* Under `System Variables`, click `New`.
* For `Variable Name`, input `JAVA_HOME`.
* For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45` exactly as shown (or wherever your Java JDK installation is) and click `OK`.
* Scroll down to a variable named `Path` and double-click on it.
* Append `;%JAVA_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `OK`. Make sure the location is correct; double-check to make sure.

#### Setup Gradle (Optional)
Gradle is used to execute the various build tasks when compiling MineColonies.

1. Download and install Gradle.
	* [Windows/Mac download link](http://www.gradle.org/downloads). You only need the binaries, but choose whatever flavor you want.
		* Unzip the package and put it wherever you want, for example, `C:\Gradle`.
	* Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.gradle.org/downloads).
		* Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/gradle-bin`
		* Archlinux: You'll have to install it from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gradle).
		* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install gradle`
		* Fedora: Install Gradle manually from its website (see above), as Fedora ships a ""broken"" version of Gradle. Use `yum install gradle` only if you know what you're doing.
2. Windows: Set environment variables for Gradle.
	* Go back to `Environment Variables` and then create a new system variable.
	* For `Variable Name`, input `GRADLE_HOME`.
	* For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Gradle-3.0` exactly as shown (or wherever your Gradle installation is), and click `Ok`.
	* Scroll down to `Path` again, and append `;%GRADLE_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `Ok`. Once again, double-check the location.
3. Open up your command line and run `gradle`. If it says 'Welcome to Gradle [version].', then you're good to go. If not, try the steps again.

#### Setup Git
Git is used to clone MineColonies and update your local copy.

1. Download and install Git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/).
2. *Optional*: Download and install a Git GUI client, such as Gitkraken, SourceTree, GitHub for Windows/Mac, SmartGitHg, TortoiseGit, etc. A nice list is available [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

#### Setup MineColonies (Command Line)
This section assumes that you're using the command line version of Git.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to a place where you want to download the MineColonies source (e.g., `C:\GitHub\MineColonies\`) by executing `cd [folder location]`. This location is known as `basefolder` from now on.
3. Execute `git clone https://github.com/Minecolonies/minecolonies.git`. This will download MineColonies' source into `basefolder`.
4. Right now, you should have a directory that looks something like this:

***
    basefolder
	\-MineColonies
		\-MineColonies' files (should have `build.gradle`)
***

#### Setup MineColonies (GitKraken)
If you decide to go with a GUI client like GitKraken:

1. Open GitKraken
2. Click `File → Clone Repo`
3. Select GitHub.com and choose a base folder to clone to.
4. Write MineColonies in the ""Repository to Clone"" and select the one by ldtteam.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jVTXyCJ.png)

5. Click 'Clone the Repo'.

#### Compile MineColonies (Command Line)
1. Navigate to the MineColonies folder and run a `dir` to make sure the `build.gradle` file is where you expect it to be.
2. Execute `gradlew build`. This first sets up Forge and downloads the necessary libraries to build MineColonies. Be patient, as this may take a while.
    * If you did everything right, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` will be displayed after it finishes.
    * If you see `BUILD FAILED`, check the error output (it should be right around `BUILD FAILED`), fix everything (if possible), and try again.
3. Go to `basefolder\MineColonies\build\libs`.
    * You should see a `.jar` file named `MineColonies-universal-null.jar`.
4. Copy the jar into your Minecraft `mods` folder, and you are done! (`~/.minecraft/mods` on Linux)
5. Alternatively, you can also run `./gradlew runClient` to start Minecraft with this jar.

#### Compile MineColonies (Intellij)
1. Right-click the `build.gradle` file (or the background of the folder it's in) and select `Open Folder as Intellij Project`.
2. Select `Auto Import` and make sure a valid Gradle and JVM are selected.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ewccjDZ.png)

3. This will prepare some of the libraries used by Forge.
4. Click `View → Tool Windows → Gradle`.
5. In the Gradle view, expand the options to `Tasks → fg_runs`.
6. Click the small refresh symbol in the upper left of the Gradle view. This sets up Forge and downloads the necessary libraries to build MineColonies. 
7. Execute `genIntellijRuns` and restart Intellij.
8. You will see a runClient and runServer startup configuration in the dropdown at the top right next to the green ""run"" button. Select one and press ""run"".
9. If it doesn't start and throws a lot of errors, try another refresh. This often does wonders.
10. If you want to produce a running jar, execute the `build` task. This will result in a runnable jar file in `basefolder\MineColonies\build\libs`.

##### Troubleshooting
If Gradle synchronization fails, make sure:
1. `File → Project structure → Project → Project SDK` is set to your installed JDK version.
2. `File → Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → Build Tools → Gradle → Gradle JVM` is set to your installed JDK version.

#### Updating Your Repository
To get the most up-to-date builds, you'll have to update your local repository periodically.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to `basefolder` in the console.
3. Ensure you have not made any changes to the local repository (if you did, there might be issues with Git).
	* If you have, try reverting them to their status when you last updated your repository.
4. Execute `git pull version/1.16.3`. This pulls all commits from the official repository that do not yet exist on your local repository and updates it (with GitKraken, click the small pull arrow at the top).

#### Troubleshooting
- Sometimes Gradle tasks fail because of missing memory. For that, you can find system-wide settings in the `.gradle` folder of your `HOME` directory (`~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or on Windows in `C:\Users\username\.gradle\gradle.properties`).
- Sometimes after a branch change, libraries can not be resolved. Running another refresh in IntelliJ or the command line usually solves this issue.

36,YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization,,"# Minecraft server optimization guide

Note for users that are on vanilla, Fabric or Spigot (or anything below Paper) - go to your server.properties and change `sync-chunk-writes` to `false`. This option is forcibly set to false on Paper and its forks, but on other server implementations you need to switch this to false manually. This allows the server to save chunks off the main thread, lessening the load on the main tick loop.

Guide for version 1.19. Some things may still apply to 1.15 - 1.18.

Based on [this guide](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/guide-server-optimization%E2%9A%A1.283181/) and other sources (all of them are linked throughout the guide when relevant).

Use the table of contents located above (next to `README.md`) to easily navigate throughout this guide.

# Intro
There will never be a guide that will give you perfect results. Each server has their own needs and limits on how much you can or are willing to sacrifice. Tinkering around with the options to fine tune them to your servers needs is what it's all about. This guide only aims to help you understand what options have impact on performance and what exactly they change. If you think you found inaccurate information within this guide, you're free to open an issue or set up a pull request to correct it.

# Preparations

## Server JAR
Your choice of server software can make a huge difference in performance and API possibilities. There are currently multiple viable popular server JARs, but there are also a few that you should stay away from for various reasons.

Recommended top picks:
* [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) - The most popular server software that aims to improve performance while fixing gameplay and mechanics inconsistencies.
* [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish) - Paper fork that aims to further improve server performance.
* [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur) - Pufferfish fork focused on features and the freedom of customization.

You should stay away from:
* Any paid server JAR that claims async anything - 99.99% chance of being a scam.
* Bukkit/CraftBukkit/Spigot - Extremely outdated in terms of performance compared to other server software you have access to.
* Any plugin/software that enables/disables/reloads plugins on runtime. See [this section](#plugins-enablingdisabling-other-plugins) to understand why.
* Many forks further downstream from Pufferfish or Purpur will encounter instability and other issues. If you're seeking more performance gains, optimize your server or invest in a personal private fork.

## Map pregen
Map pregeneration, thanks to various optimizations to chunk generation added over the years is now only useful on servers with terrible, single threaded, or limited CPUs. Though, pregeneration is commonly used to generate chunks for world-map plugins such as Pl3xMap or Dynmap.

If you still want to pregen the world, you can use a plugin such as [Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky) to do it. Make sure to set up a world border so your players don't generate new chunks! Note that pregenning can sometimes take hours depending on the radius you set in the pregen plugin. Keep in mind that with Paper and above your tps will not be affected by chunk loading, but the speed of loading chunks can significantly slow down when your server's cpu is overloaded.

It's key to remember that the overworld, nether and the end have separate world borders that need to be set up for each world. The nether dimension is 8x smaller than the overworld (if not modified with a datapack), so if you set the size wrong your players might end up outside of the world border!

**Make sure to set up a vanilla world border (`/worldborder set [diameter]`), as it limits certain functionalities such as lookup range for treasure maps that can cause lag spikes.**

# Configurations

## Networking

### [server.properties]

#### network-compression-threshold

`Good starting value: 256`

This allows you to set the cap for the size of a packet before the server attempts to compress it. Setting it higher can save some CPU resources at the cost of bandwidth, and setting it to -1 disables it. Setting this higher may also hurt clients with slower network connections. If your server is in a network with a proxy or on the same machine (with less than 2 ms ping), disabling this (-1) will be beneficial, since internal network speeds can usually handle the additional uncompressed traffic.

### [purpur.yml]

#### use-alternate-keepalive

`Good starting value: true`

You can enable Purpur's alternate keepalive system so players with bad connection don't get timed out as often. Has known incompatibility with TCPShield.

> Enabling this sends a keepalive packet once per second to a player, and only kicks for timeout if none of them were responded to in 30 seconds. Responding to any of them in any order will keep the player connected. AKA, it won't kick your players because 1 packet gets dropped somewhere along the lines  
~ https://purpurmc.org/docs/Configuration/#use-alternate-keepalive

---

## Chunks

### [server.properties]

#### simulation-distance

`Good starting value: 4`

Simulation distance is distance in chunks around the player that the server will tick. Essentially the distance from the player that things will happen. This includes furnaces smelting, crops and saplings growing, etc. This is an option you want to purposefully set low, somewhere around `3` or `4`, because of the existence of `view-distance`. This allows to load more chunks without ticking them. This effectively allows players to see further without the same performance impact.

#### view-distance

`Good starting value: 7`

This is the distance in chunks that will be sent to players, similar to no-tick-view-distance from paper.

The total view distance will be equal to the greatest value between `simulation-distance` and `view-distance`. For example, if the simulation distance is set to 4, and the view distance is 12, the total distance sent to the client will be 12 chunks.

### [spigot.yml]

#### view-distance

`Good starting value: default`

This value overwrites server.properties one if not set to `default`. You should keep it default to have both simulation and view distance in one place for easier management.

### [paper-world configuration]

#### delay-chunk-unloads-by

`Good starting value: 10s`

This option allows you to configure how long chunks will stay loaded after a player leaves. This helps to not constantly load and unload the same chunks when a player moves back and forth. Too high values can result in way too many chunks being loaded at once. In areas that are frequently teleported to and loaded, consider keeping the area permanently loaded. This will be lighter for your server than constantly loading and unloading chunks.

#### max-auto-save-chunks-per-tick

`Good starting value: 8`

Lets you slow down incremental world saving by spreading the task over time even more for better average performance. You might want to set this higher than `8` with more than 20-30 players. If incremental save can't finish in time then bukkit will automatically save leftover chunks at once and begin the process again.

#### prevent-moving-into-unloaded-chunks

`Good starting value: true`

When enabled, prevents players from moving into unloaded chunks and causing sync loads that bog down the main thread causing lag. The probability of a player stumbling into an unloaded chunk is higher the lower your view-distance is.

#### entity-per-chunk-save-limit

```
Good starting values:

    area_effect_cloud: 8
    arrow: 16
    dragon_fireball: 3
    egg: 8
    ender_pearl: 8
    experience_bottle: 3
    experience_orb: 16
    eye_of_ender: 8
    fireball: 8
    firework_rocket: 8
    llama_spit: 3
    potion: 8
    shulker_bullet: 8
    small_fireball: 8
    snowball: 8
    spectral_arrow: 16
    trident: 16
    wither_skull: 4
```

With the help of this entry you can set limits to how many entities of specified type can be saved. You should provide a limit for each projectile at least to avoid issues with massive amounts of projectiles being saved and your server crashing on loading that. You can put any entity id here, see the minecraft wiki to find IDs of entities. Please adjust the limit to your liking. Suggested value for all projectiles is around `10`. You can also add other entities by their type names to that list. This config option is not designed to prevent players from making large mob farms.

### [pufferfish.yml]

#### max-loads-per-projectile

`Good starting value: 8`

Specifies the maximum amount of chunks a projectile can load in its lifetime. Decreasing will reduce chunk loads caused by entity projectiles, but could cause issues with tridents, enderpearls, etc.

---

## Mobs

### [bukkit.yml]

#### spawn-limits

```
Good starting values:

    monsters: 20
    animals: 5
    water-animals: 2
    water-ambient: 2
    water-underground-creature: 3
    axolotls: 3
    ambient: 1
```

The math of limiting mobs is `[playercount] * [limit]`, where ""playercount"" is current amount of players on the server. Logically, the smaller the numbers are, the less mobs you're gonna see. `per-player-mob-spawn` applies an additional limit to this, ensuring mobs are equally distributed between players. Reducing this is a double-edged sword; yes, your server has less work to do, but in some gamemodes natural-spawning mobs are a big part of a gameplay. You can go as low as 20 or less if you adjust `mob-spawn-range` properly. Setting `mob-spawn-range` lower will make it feel as if there are more mobs around each player. If you are using Paper, you can set mob limits per world in [paper-world configuration].

#### ticks-per

```
Good starting values:

    monster-spawns: 10
    animal-spawns: 400
    water-spawns: 400
    water-ambient-spawns: 400
    water-underground-creature-spawns: 400
    axolotl-spawns: 400
    ambient-spawns: 400
```

This option sets how often (in ticks) the server attempts to spawn certain living entities. Water/ambient mobs do not need to spawn each tick as they don't usually get killed that quickly. As for monsters: Slightly increasing the time between spawns should not impact spawn rates even in mob farms. In most cases all of the values under this option should be higher than `1`. Setting this higher also allows your server to better cope with areas where mob spawning is disabled.

### [spigot.yml]

#### mob-spawn-range

`Good starting value: 3`

Allows you to reduce the range (in chunks) of where mobs will spawn around the player. Depending on your server's gamemode and its playercount you might want to reduce this value along with [bukkit.yml]'s `spawn-limits`. Setting this lower will make it feel as if there are more mobs around you. This should be lower than or equal to your simulation distance, and never larger than your hard despawn range / 16.

#### entity-activation-range

```
Good starting values:

      animals: 16
      monsters: 24
      raiders: 48
      misc: 8
      water: 8
      villagers: 16
      flying-monsters: 48
```

You can set what distance from the player an entity should be for it to tick (do stuff). Reducing those values helps performance, but may result in irresponsive mobs until the player gets really close to them. Lowering this too far can break certain mob farms; iron farms being the most common victim.

#### entity-tracking-range

```
Good starting values:

      players: 48
      animals: 48
      monsters: 48
      misc: 32
      other: 64
```

This is distance in blocks from which entities will be visible. They just won't be sent to players. If set too low this can cause mobs to seem to appear out of nowhere near a player. In the majority of cases this should be higher than your `entity-activation-range`.

#### tick-inactive-villagers

`Good starting value: false`

This allows you to control whether villagers should be ticked outside of the activation range. This will make villagers proceed as normal and ignore the activation range. Disabling this will help performance, but might be confusing for players in certain situations. This may cause issues with iron farms and trade restocking.

#### nerf-spawner-mobs

`Good starting value: true`

You can make mobs spawned by a monster spawner have no AI. Nerfed mobs will do nothing. You can make them jump while in water by changing `spawner-nerfed-mobs-should-jump` to `true` in [paper-world configuration].

### [paper-world configuration]

#### despawn-ranges

```
Good starting values:

      ambient:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      axolotls:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      creature:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      misc:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      monster:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      underground_water_creature:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      water_ambient:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      water_creature:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
```

Lets you adjust entity despawn ranges (in blocks). Lower those values to clear the mobs that are far away from the player faster. You should keep soft range around `30` and adjust hard range to a bit more than your actual simulation-distance, so mobs don't immediately despawn when the player goes just beyond the point of a chunk being loaded (this works well because of `delay-chunk-unloads-by` in [paper-world configuration]). When a mob is out of the hard range, it will be instantly despawned. When between the soft and hard range, it will have a random chance of despawning. Your hard range should be larger than your soft range. You should adjust this according to your view distance using `(simulation-distance * 16) + 8`. This partially accounts for chunks that haven't been unloaded yet after player visited them.

#### per-player-mob-spawns

`Good starting value: true`

This option decides if mob spawns should account for how many mobs are around target player already. You can bypass a lot of issues regarding mob spawns being inconsistent due to players creating farms that take up the entire mobcap. This will enable a more singleplayer-like spawning experience, allowing you to set lower `spawn-limits`. Enabling this does come with a very slight performance impact, however it's impact is overshadowed by the improvements in `spawn-limits` it allows.

#### max-entity-collisions

`Good starting value: 2`

Overwrites option with the same name in [spigot.yml]. It lets you decide how many collisions one entity can process at once. Value of `0` will cause inability to push other entities, including players. Value of `2` should be enough in most cases. It's worth noting that this will render maxEntityCramming gamerule useless if its value is over the value of this config option.

#### update-pathfinding-on-block-update

`Good starting value: false`

Disabling this will result in less pathfinding being done, increasing performance. In some cases this will cause mobs to appear more laggy; They will just passively update their path every 5 ticks (0.25 sec).

#### fix-climbing-bypassing-cramming-rule

`Good starting value: true`

Enabling this will fix entities not being affected by cramming while climbing. This will prevent absurd amounts of mobs being stacked in small spaces even if they're climbing (spiders).

#### armor-stands.tick

`Good starting value: false`

In most cases you can safely set this to `false`. If you're using armor stands or any plugins that modify their behavior and you experience issues, re-enable it. This will prevent armor stands from being pushed by water or being affected by gravity.

#### armor-stands.do-collision-entity-lookups

`Good starting value: false`

Here you can disable armor stand collisions. This will help if you have a lot of armor stands and don't need them colliding with anything.

#### tick-rates

```
Good starting values:

  behavior:
    villager:
      validatenearbypoi: 60
      acquirepoi: 120
  sensor:
    villager:
      secondarypoisensor: 80
      nearestbedsensor: 80
      villagerbabiessensor: 40
      playersensor: 40
      nearestlivingentitysensor: 40
```

> It is not recommended to change these values from their defaults while [Pufferfish's DAB](#dabenabled) is enabled!

This decides how often specified behaviors and sensors are being fired in ticks. `acquirepoi` for villagers seems to be the heaviest behavior, so it's been greately increased. Decrease it in case of issues with villagers finding their way around.

### [pufferfish.yml]

#### dab.enabled

`Good starting value: true`

DAB (dynamic activation of brain) reduces the amount an entity is ticked the further away it is from players. DAB works on a gradient instead of a hard cutoff like EAR. Instead of fully ticking close entities and barely ticking far entities, DAB will reduce the amount an entity is ticked based on the result of a calculation influenced by [dab.activation-dist-mod](#dabactivation-dist-mod).

#### dab.max-tick-freq

`Good starting value: 20`

Defines the slowest amount entities farthest from players will be ticked. Increasing this value may improve the performance of entities far from view but may break farms or greatly nerf mob behavior. If enabling DAB breaks mob farms, try decreasing this value.

#### dab.activation-dist-mod

`Good starting value: 7`

Controls the gradient in which mobs are ticked. Decreasing this will activate DAB closer to players, improving DAB's performance gains, but will affect how entities interact with their surroundings and may break mob farms. If enabling DAB breaks mob farms, try increasing this value.

#### enable-async-mob-spawning

`Good starting value: true`

If asynchronous mob spawning should be enabled. For this to work, the Paper's per-player-mob-spawns setting must be enabled. This option does not actually spawn mobs asynchronous, but does offload much of the computational effort involved with spawning new mobs to a different thread. Enabling this option should not be noticeable on vanilla gameplay.

#### enable-suffocation-optimization

`Good starting value: true`

This option optimises a suffocation check (the check to see if a mob is inside a block and if they should take suffocation damage), by rate limiting the check to the damage timeout. This optimisation should be impossible to notice unless you're an extremely technical player who's using tick-precise timing to kill an entity at exactly the right time by suffocation.

#### inactive-goal-selector-throttle

`Good starting value: true`

Throttles the AI goal selector in entity inactive ticks, causing the inactive entities to update their goal selector every 20 ticks instead of every tick. Can improve performance by a few percent, and has minor gameplay implications.

### [purpur.yml]

#### zombie.aggressive-towards-villager-when-lagging

`Good starting value: false`

Enabling this will cause zombies to stop targeting villagers if the server is below the tps threshold set with `lagging-threshold` in [purpur.yml].

#### entities-can-use-portals

`Good starting value: false`

This option can disable portal usage of all entities besides the player. This prevents entities from loading chunks by changing worlds which is handled on the main thread. This has the side effect of entities not being able to go through portals.

#### villager.lobotomize.enabled

`Good starting value: true`

> This should only be enabled if villagers are causing lag! Otherwise, the pathfinding checks may decrease performance.

Lobotomized villagers are stripped from their AI and only restock their offers every so often. Enabling this will lobotomize villagers that are unable to pathfind to their destination. Freeing them should unlobotomize them.

---

## Misc

### [spigot.yml]

#### merge-radius

```
Good starting values:

      item: 3.5
      exp: 4.0
```

This decides the distance between the items and exp orbs to be merged, reducing the amount of items ticking on the ground. Setting this too high will lead to the illusion of items or exp orbs disappearing as they merge together. Setting this too high will break some farms, as well as allow items to teleport through blocks. There are no checks done to prevent items from merging through walls. Exp is only merged on creation.

#### hopper-transfer

`Good starting value: 8`

Time in ticks that hoppers will wait to move an item. Increasing this will help improve performance if there are a lot of hoppers on your server, but will break hopper-based clocks and possibly item sorting systems if set too high.

#### hopper-check

`Good starting value: 8`

Time in ticks between hoppers checking for an item above them or in the inventory above them. Increasing this will help performance if there are a lot of hoppers on your server, but will break hopper-based clocks and item sorting systems relying on water streams.

### [paper-world configuration]

#### alt-item-despawn-rate

```
Good starting values:

      enabled: true
      items:
        cobblestone: 300
        netherrack: 300
        sand: 300
        red_sand: 300
        gravel: 300
        dirt: 300
        grass: 300
        pumpkin: 300
        melon_slice: 300
        kelp: 300
        bamboo: 300
        sugar_cane: 300
        twisting_vines: 300
        weeping_vines: 300
        oak_leaves: 300
        spruce_leaves: 300
        birch_leaves: 300
        jungle_leaves: 300
        acacia_leaves: 300
        dark_oak_leaves: 300
        mangrove_leaves: 300
        cactus: 300
        diorite: 300
        granite: 300
        andesite: 300
        scaffolding: 600
```

This list lets you set alternative time (in ticks) to despawn certain types of dropped items faster or slower than default. This option can be used instead of item clearing plugins along with `merge-radius` to improve performance.

#### redstone-implementation

`Good starting value: ALTERNATE_CURRENT`

Replaces the redstone system with faster and alternative versions that reduce redundant block updates, lowering the amount of logic your server has to calculate. Using a non-vanilla implementation may introduce minor inconsistencies with very technical redstone, but the performance gains far outweigh the possible niche issues. A non-vanilla implementation option may additionally fix other redstone inconsistencies caused by CraftBukkit.

The `ALTERNATE_CURRENT` implementation is based off of the [Alternate Current](https://modrinth.com/mod/alternate-current) mod. More information on this algorithm can be found on their resource page.

#### hopper.disable-move-event

`Good starting value: false`

`InventoryMoveItemEvent` doesn't fire unless there is a plugin actively listening to that event. This means that you only should set this to true if you have such plugin(s) and don't care about them not being able to act on this event. **Do not set to true if you want to use plugins that listen to this event, e.g. protection plugins!**

#### hopper.ignore-occluding-blocks

`Good starting value: true`

Determines if hoppers will ignore containers inside full blocks, for example hopper minecart inside sand or gravel block. Keeping this enabled will break some contraptions depending on that behavior.

#### tick-rates.mob-spawner

`Good starting value: 2`

This option lets you configure how often spawners should be ticked. Higher values mean less lag if you have a lot of spawners, although if set too high (relative to your spawners delay) mob spawn rates will decrease.

#### optimize-explosions

`Good starting value: true`

Setting this to `true` replaces the vanilla explosion algorithm with a faster one, at a cost of slight inaccuracy when calculating explosion damage. This is usually not noticeable.

#### treasure-maps.enabled

`Good starting value: false`

Generating treasure maps is extremely expensive and can hang a server if the structure it's trying to locate is in an ungenerated chunk. It's only safe to enable this if you pregenerated your world and set a vanilla world border.

#### treasure-maps.find-already-discovered

```
Good starting values:
      loot-tables: true
      villager-trade: true
```

Default value of this option forces the newly generated maps to look for unexplored structure, which are usually in not yet generated chunks. Setting this to true makes it so maps can lead to the structures that were discovered earlier. If you don't change this to `true` you may experience the server hanging or crashing when generating new treasure maps. `villager-trade` is for maps traded by villagers and loot-tables refers to anything that generates loot dynamically like treasure chests, dungeon chests, etc.

#### tick-rates.grass-spread

`Good starting value: 4`

Time in ticks between the server trying to spread grass or mycelium. This will make it so large areas of dirt will take a little longer to turn to grass or mycelium. Setting this to around `4` should work nicely if you want to decrease it without the decreased spread rate being noticeable.

#### tick-rates.container-update

`Good starting value: 1`

Time in ticks between container updates. Increasing this might help if container updates cause issues for you (it rarely happens), but makes it easier for players to experience desync when interacting with inventories (ghost items).

#### non-player-arrow-despawn-rate

`Good starting value: 20`

Time in ticks after which arrows shot by mobs should disappear after hitting something. Players can't pick these up anyway, so you may as well set this to something like `20` (1 second).

#### creative-arrow-despawn-rate

`Good starting value: 20`

Time in ticks after which arrows shot by players in creative mode should disappear after hitting something. Players can't pick these up anyway, so you may as well set this to something like `20` (1 second).

### [pufferfish.yml]

#### disable-method-profiler

`Good starting value: true`

This option will disable some additional profiling done by the game. This profiling is not necessary to run in production and can cause additional lag.

### [purpur.yml]

#### dolphin.disable-treasure-searching

`Good starting value: true`

Prevents dolphins from performing structure search similar to treasure maps

#### teleport-if-outside-border

`Good starting value: true`

Allows you to teleport the player to the world spawn if they happen to be outside of the world border. Helpful since the vanilla world border is bypassable and the damage it does to the player can be mitigated.

---

## Helpers

### [paper-world configuration]

#### anti-xray.enabled

`Good starting value: true`

Enable this to hide ores from x-rayers. For detailed configuration of this feature check out [Configuring Anti-Xray](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/anti-xray). Enabling this will actually decrease performance, however it is much more efficient than any anti-xray plugin. In most cases the performance impact will be negligible.

#### nether-ceiling-void-damage-height

`Good starting value: 127`

If this option is greater that `0`, players above the set y level will be damaged as if they were in the void. This will prevent players from using the nether roof. Vanilla nether is 128 blocks tall, so you should probably set it to `127`. If you modify the height of the nether in any way you should set this to `[your_nether_height] - 1`.

---

# Java startup flags
[Vanilla Minecraft and Minecraft server software in version 1.19 requires Java 17 or higher](https://docs.papermc.io/java-install-update). Oracle has changed their licensing, and there is no longer a compelling reason to get your java from them. Recommended vendors are [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) and [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/). Alternative JVM implementations such as OpenJ9 or GraalVM can work, however they are not supported by Paper and have been known to cause issues, therefore they are not currently recommended.

Your garbage collector can be configured to reduce lag spikes caused by big garbage collector tasks. You can find startup flags optimized for Minecraft servers [here](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags) [`SOG`]. Keep in mind that this recommendation will not work on alternative JVM implementations.
It's recommended to use the [flags.sh](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags) startup flags generator to get the correct startup flags for your server

In addition, adding the beta flag `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector` before `-jar` in your startup flags can improve performance. This flag enables Pufferfish to use SIMD instructions on your CPU, making some maths faster. Currently, it's only used for making rendering in game plugin maps (like imageonmaps) possibly 8 times faster.

# ""Too good to be true"" plugins

## Plugins removing ground items
Absolutely unnecessary since they can be replaced with [merge-radius](#merge-radius) and [alt-item-despawn-rate](#alt-item-despawn-rate) and frankly, they're less configurable than basic server configs. They tend to use more resources scanning and removing items than not removing the items at all.

## Mob stacker plugins
It's really hard to justify using one. Stacking naturally spawned entities causes more lag than not stacking them at all due to the server constantly trying to spawn more mobs. The only ""acceptable"" use case is for spawners on servers with a large amount of spawners.

## Plugins enabling/disabling other plugins
Anything that enables or disables plugins on runtime is extremely dangerous. Loading a plugin like that can cause fatal errors with tracking data and disabling a plugin can lead to errors due to removing dependency. The `/reload` command suffers from exact same issues and you can read more about them in [me4502's blog post](https://madelinemiller.dev/blog/problem-with-reload/)

# What's lagging? - measuring performance

## mspt
Paper offers a `/mspt` command that will tell you how much time the server took to calculate recent ticks. If the first and second value you see are lower than 50, then congratulations! Your server is not lagging! If the third value is over 50 then it means there was at least 1 tick that took longer. That's completely normal and happens from time to time, so don't panic.
  
## Spark
[Spark](https://spark.lucko.me/) is a plugin that allows you to profile your server's CPU and memory usage. You can read on how to use it [on its wiki](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/). There's also a guide on how to find the cause of lag spikes [here](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes).

## Timings
Way to see what might be going on when your server is lagging are Timings. Timings is a tool that lets you see exactly what tasks are taking the longest. It's the most basic troubleshooting tool and if you ask for help regarding lag you will most likely be asked for your Timings. Timings is known to have a serious performance impact on servers, it's recommended to use the Spark plugin over Timings and use Purpur or Pufferfish to disable Timings all together.

To get Timings of your server, you just need to execute the `/timings paste` command and click the link you're provided with. You can share this link with other people to let them help you. It's also easy to misread if you don't know what you're doing. There is a detailed [video tutorial by Aikar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4J0A9l7bfQ) on how to read them.

=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dan200/ComputerCraft.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dan200/ComputerCraft)

ComputerCraft is a Minecraft modification which adds programmable Robots and Computers to the world of Minecraft.
If you're not familiar with ComputerCraft, visit the [Website](http://www.computercraft.info/download) or the [Wiki](http://www.computercraft.info/wiki) to find out more.

About this Repository
=====================

ComputerCraft was originally released in late 2011 by [Daniel Ratcliffe](https://twitter.com/DanTwoHundred). In early 2017, after working on the mod solo for five years, it was decided to release the source code publicly to allow Dan to devote time to other projects. This repository marks the first public release of this source code.

The code in this repository will always represent the ""bleeding edge"" of the ComputerCraft codebase, but stable builds back to 1.79 will be marked on the [Releases](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/releases) page.

Contributing
============

While ComputerCraft will no longer be actively developed by Daniel Ratcliffe, you may still contribute pull requests which will be reviewed and incorporated into releases periodically. A pull request is more likely to be accepted if it meets the following criteria:

* It does not add any new dependencies for compiling, running or using the mod.
* It does not break compatibility with world saves or programs created with previous versions of the mod.
* It does not add unneccessary complexity for users of the mod, and maintains the accessibility for which the mod is known.
* It does not add unneccessary complexity or stylistic changes to the code, especially where functionality is not being changed.
* It does not create bugs!

The pull requests most likely to be accepted are those which fix bugs, simplify code, or make the mod compatible with newer versions of Minecraft.

40,ReplayMod/ReplayMod,Java,"# ReplayMod
A Minecraft mod to record game sessions and replay them afterwards from any perspective.

## Building
Make sure your sub-projects are up-to-date: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

For compiling 1.7.10, you must run `./gradlew :jGui:1.7.10:setupDecompWorkspace :1.7.10:setupDecompWorkspace` once after the initial clone. This may take quite some time.

### No IDE
You can build the mod by running `./gradlew build` (or just `./gradlew bundleJar`). You can then find the final jar files in `versions/$MCVERSION/build/libs/`.
You can also build single versions by running `./gradlew :1.8:build` (or just `./gradlew :1.8:bundleJar`) (builds the MC 1.8 version).

### IntelliJ
Ensure you have at least IDEA 2020.1.
Build the mod via Gradle as explained above at least once (`./gradlew compileJava` should be sufficient). This will ensure that the sources for all MC versions are generated.
Then import the Gradle project from within IDEA: File -> Open -> build.gradle -> Open as Project
Finally configure IDEA to build everything by itself instead of delegating it to Gradle (cause that is slow): File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Build and run using: IntelliJ IDEA

### Eclipse

## Development
### Branches
Loosely based on [this branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) with `stable` instead of `master`.

TL;DR:
Main development happens on the `develop` branch, snapshots are built from this branch.
The `stable` branch contains the most recent release.

The `master` branch is solely to be used for the `version.json` file that contains a list of all versions
used by the clients to check for updates of this mod.

### The Preprocessor
To support multiple Minecraft versions with the ReplayMod, a [JCP](https://github.com/raydac/java-comment-preprocessor)-inspired preprocessor is used.
It has by now acquired a lot more sophisticated features to make it as noninvasive as possible.
Please read the [preprocessor's README](https://github.com/ReplayMod/preprocessor/blob/master/README.md) to understand how it works.

### Versioning
The ReplayMod uses the versioning scheme outlined [here](https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/1.12.x/conventions/versioning/)
with three changes:
- No `MAJORAPI`, the ReplayMod does not provide any external API
- ""Updating to a new Minecraft version"" should not increment `MAJORMOD`, we maintain one version of the ReplayMod
for each version of Minecraft and all these versions share the same feature set (and most bugs). We therefore try to
keep the version name the same for all of them (with the exception of `MCVERSION` of course). This also means that the
""Multiple Minecraft Version"" section does not apply.
- For pre-releases the shorter `-bX` is used instead of `-betaX`

When a new version is (pre-)release, a new commit modifying the `version.txt` file should be added and the
`versions.json` file in the `master` branch should be updated. To simplify this process the gradle task `doRelease` can
be used: `./gradlew -PreleaseVersion=2.0.0-rc1 doRelease`. It will create the commit and update the version.json
accordingly.

Care should be taken that the updated `version.json` is not pushed before a jar file is available on the
download page (or Jenkins) as it will inform the users of the update.

### Bugs
GitHub should generally be used to report bugs.

In the past, bugs were tracked via [Bugzilla](https://bugs.replaymod.com/), so bug numbers in commits prior to 2020 such as `(fixes #42)` generally referred to Bugzilla unless noted otherwise.

## License
The ReplayMod is provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 3 or (at your option) any later version.

_MinecraftStats_ is a web browser application for the [statistics](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Statistics) that Minecraft servers collect about players.

The presentation is done by giving __awards__ to players for certain achievements. For example, the player who played on the server for the longest total time receives the _Addict_ award. Every award has a viewable ranking associated to it with __medals__ - the award holder gets the gold medal, the second the silver medal and the third the bronze medal for the award. Each medal gives players a __crown score__ (1 for every bronze medal, 2 for every silver, 4 for every gold medal), which is displayed in a server __hall of fame__.

The system is highly customizable. All the awards are defined in Python modules that can be altered, added or removed to fit your needs. Additionally to simply reading Minecraft's original statistics, there are some awards that are combinations of various statistics.

A live demo of _MinecraftStats_ in action is available here: [DVG Snapshot Stats](http://mine3.dvgaming.com/)

Feel free to join the project [Discord](https://discord.gg/brH5PGG8By) 

## Setup Guide
This section describes how to set up _MinecraftStats_ to work on your server.

### Compatibility
_MinecraftStats_ is compatible only to Minecraft 1.13 or later (more precisely: snapshot [17w47a](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/17w47a) or later).

I am trying to keep the statistics up to date with new Minecraft versions. However, Mojang sometimes decide to rename entity or statistic IDs, which may break some awards. I am trying my best to update accordingly, but please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/pdinklag/MinecraftStats/issues) in case you notice something is wrong!

### Requirements
_Python 3.4_ or later is required to feed _MinecraftStats_ with your server's data.

### Installation

I recommend using git to check out the `master` branch of this repository somewhere under your webserver's document root (e.g. `/var/www/html`), as it makes updating easier (see below).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pdinklag/MinecraftStats.git
```

However, downloading the repository as a zip file and unpacking it there will work as well.

The web application is accessed via `index.html` - so you'll simply need to point your players to the URL corresponding to the installation path.

##### Updating MinecraftStats

To update _MinecraftStats_ to a newer version, if you are using git, the following will do the trick:

```sh
git pull
```

Otherwise, re-download the repository and overwrite any existing files.

### Feeding The Data

The heart of _MinecraftStats_ is the `update.py` script, which loads the player statistics from your Minecraft server into the database for the web application. Said database is file-based and will be stored in the `data` directory by default.

To call the update script, simply go into the installation directory and execute the following:

```sh
python3 update.py config.json
```

When you do this for the first time, the file called `config.json` will be created for you with a default configuration.

You will also receive the following message:

```
server.path not configured, please edit config.json
```

This is because _MinecraftStats_ does not yet know where your Minecraft server is installed. So go ahead and enter the path to your Minecraft server under the `server > path` setting in `config.json`. See below for more configuration possibilities.

### Configuration

The configuration JSON file supprots the following settings:

* `client`
  * `defaultLanguage` - the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) code of the default language to use when none was explicitly selected by the user (*default: en*) .
  * `playerCacheUUIDPrefix` - short explanation: *do not touch*. Determines player cache grouping by UUIDs. Most of the time you should leave the default value of 2 untouched. If you have *many* active players on your server (e.g., thousands) and wish to reduce traffic and load times somewhat, you may try increasing this to 3 to see if it helps. Note that increasing this value will increase the number of files under `data/playercache` *exponentially* (!), so handle with care (*default: 2*).
  * `playersPerPage` - how many players to display at most in the players list (*default: 100*).
  * `showLastOnline` - if `true`, the last online date and time will be displayed for players (*default: true*).
* `configVersion` - used internally, do not change manually.
* `crown`
  * `bronze` - the crown score worth of a bronze medal (*default: 1*)
  * `silver` - the crown score worth of a silver medal (*default: 2*)
  * `gold` - the crown score worth of a gold medal (*default: 4*)
* `events` - see below in the *Events* section.
* `players`
  * `exclude` - a list of UUIDs to exclude from the stats (*default: empty*)
  * `excludeBanned` - if `true`, exclude players listed in `banned-players.json` from the stats (*default: true*)
  * `excludeOps` - if `true`, exclude players listed in `ops.json` from the stats (*default: false*)
  * `inactiveDays` - if a player is inactive for this many days, they will no longer be eligible for any awards (*default: 7*)
* `minPlaytime` - only players having played this many minutes or more will be eligible for awards (*default: 0*)
  * `profileUpdateInterval` - update player names and skins using the Mojang API every this many days (*default: 3*)
  * `updateInactive` - also update names and skins of inactive players (not recommended) (*default: false*)
* `server`
  * `sources` - a list of data sources, each of which must define the following
    * `path` - the path to the Minecraft server installation (*no default*)
    * `worldName` the name of the world on the server that contains the player statistics (`stats` directory with JSON files in it). In most cases, this is simply `world` (*default: world*).
  * `customName` - the server name to display on the home page. Leave this at `null` to use the MOTD from your `server.properties` (*default: null*)

A nice commented overview with default values can also be found in `mcstats/config.py`

##### Combining Multiple Servers

You can combine multiple servers (e.g., servers connected via BungeeCord) into a single stat database by listing multiple entries in the `server` &rarr; `sources` configuration like so:

```json
{
    ""server"": {
        ""sources"": [
            {
                ""path"": ""/opt/minecraft/server1"",
                ""worldName"": ""world1""
            },
            {
                ""path"": ""/opt/minecraft/server2"",
                ""worldName"": ""world2""
            },
        ],
    },
}
```

Any number of servers can be combined this way. Note that *MinecraftStats* will get the server name (MOTD) and icon from the first source only.

##### Migrating Command-Line Configurations

If you have been using _MinecraftStats_ before the configuration was changed to JSON-based, you can use the `makeconfig.py` script with all your old arguments to generate the corresponding JSON configuration, for example:

```sh
python3 makeconfig.py -s /path/to/server --min-playtime 60 > config.json
```

Note that the way how events are started and stopped has changed. You will find the new information in the *Events* section.

#### Troubleshooting

You may encounter the following messages during the update:

* `update.py: error: unrecognized arguments: ...` - if you are sure that everything is right, it may be that when you last used *MinecraftStats*, configuration was still done via the command line. This has changed and you need to switch to the JSON based configuration described above. You can call `makeconfig.py` with the old list of arguments to create a JSON file from it to make the process easier.

* `updating profile for <player> ...` - the updater needs to download the player's skin URL every so often using Mojang's web API ,so that the browser won't have to do it later and slow the web application down. __If this fails__, make sure that Python is able to open `https` connections to `sessionserver.mojang.com`.
* `HTTP Error 429` - Mojang has some limitations on their API that MinecraftStats uses to get player skins. If too many requests for the same player are done within a certain time frame (the exact specs are not known to me), Mojang's API refuses the request with a 429 code. This normally shouldn't happen if you use the default profile update interval.
* `unsupported data version 0 for <player>` - this means that `<player>` has not logged into your server for a long time and his data format is still from Minecraft 1.12.2 or earlier.

In case you encounter any error messages and can't find an explanation, don't hesistate to [open an issue](https://github.com/pdinklag/MinecraftStats/issues).

After the update, you will have a `data` directory that contains everything the web application needs; refer to the *Database Structure* section for details.

### Automatic Updates
_MinecraftStats_ does not include any means for automatic updates - you need to take care of this yourself.

#### Cronjobs

The most common way to do it on Linux servers is by creating a cronjob that starts the update script regularly, e.g., every 10 minutes.

:warning: Note that ​ *MinecraftStats* will produce the output (`data` directory) in the *current working directory*, and not simply where `update.py` is located. This means that your cronjob may have to start with a `cd` to your *MinecraftStats* directory, otherwise the output will be created in the home directory of the cron user.

Typically, a cronjob for *MinecraftStats* will look like this:

```
# update MinecraftStats every 10 minutes
 */10 *  *  *  *  cd /path/to/mcstats ; python3 update.py config.json
```

#### Windows

If you're using Windows to run your server... figure something out! There's probably some task scheduler available that you can use.

### FTP
In case you use FTP to transfer the JSON files to another machine before updating, please note that _MinecraftStats_ uses a JSON file's last modified date in order to determine a player's last play time. Therefore, in order for it to function correctly, the last modified timestamps of the files need to be retained.

### Database Structure
The `data` directory will contain the following after running an update:
* `summary.json.gz` - This is a summary for the web application, containing information about the server and everything needed to display the award listing.
* `server-icon.png` - if your server has an icon, this will be a copy of it. Otherwise, a default icon will be used.
* `events` - contains one JSON file for every event containing player scores.
* `playercache` - cache of player names and skin IDs, grouped by player UUIDs.
* `playerdata` - contains one JSON file for every player, containing information displayed in the player view.
* `playerlist` - contains an index for player information used by the player list.
* `rankings` - contains one JSON file for every award containing player rankings.

## Events
Events allow you to track a specific award stat for a limited amount of time. You can plan events via the `events` list in the config JSON. The following information needs to be specified for an event:

* `name` - the *unique* internal name of the event, which needs to be a valid file and URL name, i.e., you should not use spaces or special characters here. Every event needs a different name, even if they share the same title, and they must not collide with the ID of any actual stat.
* `title` - the title of the event displayed in the browser.
* `stat` - the ID of the award stat counted for the event. An easy way to find these IDs is by clicking an award in the browser and getting it from the URL.
* `startTime` - the time at which the event starts in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, where the hour field assumes a 24h day).
* `endTime` - the time at which the event ends (same format as `startTime`).

When you run `update.py`, events will automatically be started or stopped based on the current server time. Please note that there should be at least one update *before* the event starts, so that each player's initial score can be saved.

##### Event Example

As an example, let's consider a Halloween-themed event called ""Skeleton Hunt"" that tracks how many skeletons people kill between October 30, 10 o'clock in the morning and midnight of November 1. We would add the following to the config JSON:

```json
...
	""events"": [
        {
            ""name"": ""skeleton_hunt_2021"",
            ""title"": ""Skeleton Hunt"",
            ""stat"": ""kill_skeleton"",
            ""startTime"": ""2021-10-30 10:00"",
            ""endTime"": ""2021-01-01 00:00""
        }
    ],
...
```

## Customizing Awards

I assume here that you have some very basic knowledge of Python, however, you may also get away without any.

`update.py` imports all modules from the `mcstats/stats` directory. Here you will find many `.py` files that define the awards in a pretty straightforward way.

Any changes will be in effect the next time `update.py` is executed.

### Adding New Awards
For adding a new award, follow these steps:

1. Create a new module in `mcstats/stats` and register your `MinecraftStat` instances (see below).
2. Place an icon for the award in `img/award-icons`. If your award ID is `my_award`, the icon's file name needs to be `my_award.png`.

#### The MinecraftStat Class
A `MinecraftStat` object consists of an _ID_, some _meta information_ (_title_, _description_ and a _unit_ for statistic values) and a _StatReader_.

The _ID_ is simply the award's internal identifier. It is used for the database and the web application also uses it to locate the award icon (`img/award-icons/<id>.png`).

The _meta information_ is for display in the web application. The following units are supported:
* `int` - a simple integer number with no unit.
* `ticks` - time statistics are usually measured in ticks. The web application will convert this into a human readable duration (seconds, minutes, hours, ...).
* `cm` - Minecraft measures distances in centimeters. The web application will convert this to a suitable metric unit.

The _StatReader_ is responsible for calculating the displayed and ranked statistic value. Most commonly, this simply reads one single entry from a player's statistics JSON, but more complex calculations are possible (e.g., summing up various statistics like for the `mine_stone`.

There are various readers, the usage of which is best explained by having a close look to the existing awards. If you require new types of calculations, dig in the `mcstats/mcstats.py` file and expand upon what's there.

### Modifying and Removing Awards
In order to modify or remove an award, find the corresponding module and modify or delete it to suit your needs.

Note that some awards, e.g., all the mob kill awards, are grouped into a single python file.

## Development Notes
This section contains some hints for those who want to develop on _MinecraftStats_.

### Web Frontend Localization

The web frontend is fully localized. If you cannot find your language yet, please feel very welcome to provide a localization and create a pull request! In order to add a new language, two things have to be done:

* Create a new language JSON file in the `localizations` directory and fill it with your translations. For the file name, please choose the corresponding [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) code for your language.
* Find the `mcstats.languages` array in `js/dev/mcstats-localization.js` and add a new entry for your language there. The text should be the name of the language in that language (e.g. ""Deutsch"" for German, which is the German word for ""German"").

### JavaScript and CSS minimization

In an effort to reduce client traffic, the JavaScript and CSS files of the web UI are minified. The JavaScripts are minified using [terser](https://github.com/terser/terser). Refer to the `minimize.sh` script located in the `js` directory for the command-line used to do so. For CSS minimization, I use [uglifycss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglifycss) without any special command-line parameters.

## License and Attribution

_MinecraftStats_ is released under the [Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. This means you can pretty much use and modify it freely, with the only requirements being attribution and not putting it under restrictive (e.g., commercial) licenses if modified.

Concerning the _attribution_ part, the only requirement is that you provide a visible link to [this original repository](https://github.com/pdinklag/MinecraftStats) in your installment. The easiest way to do this is by not removing it from the `index.html` footer, where you will also find a reminder about this.

## Contributing

If you want to help but are not sure what to do, take a look at our [planning board](https://github.com/orgs/Wurst-Imperium/projects/5/views/1) or the [help wanted list](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). Of course you can contribute anything you like, but these issues are particularly useful.

If you are contributing multiple unrelated features, please create a separate pull request for each feature. Squeezing everything into one giant pull request makes it very difficult for me to add your features, as I have to test, validate and add them one by one.

Thank you for your understanding - and thanks again for taking the time to contribute!!

## Translations

We have a [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/wurst7) for translations. You can also submit translations here on GitHub, but Crowdin is preferred since it makes it much easier to resolve issues.

To enable translations in-game, go to Wurst Options > Translations > ON.

Names of features (hacks/commands/etc.) should always be kept in English. This ensures that everyone can use the same commands, keybinds, etc. regardless of their language setting. It also makes it easier to communicate with someone who uses Wurst in a different language.

The translation files are located in [this folder](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/tree/master/src/main/resources/assets/wurst/lang), in case you need them.

MultiMC
=======

MultiMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

## Development
If you want to contribute, talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/multimc) first.

While blindly submitting PRs is definitely possible, they're not necessarily going to get accepted.

We aren't looking for flashy features, but expanding upon the existing feature set without disruption or endangering the future viability of the project is OK.

### Building
If you want to build the launcher yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

### Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:
* Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
* Prefer readability over dogma.
* Keep to the existing formatting.
* Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
* Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.

## Translations
Translations can be done [on crowdin](https://translate.multimc.org). Please avoid making direct pull requests to the translations repository.

## Forking/Redistributing/Custom builds policy
We keep Launcher open source because we think it's important to be able to see the source code for a project like this, and we do so using the Apache license.

The license gives you access to the source MultiMC is built from, but not:
- The name, logo and other branding.
- The API tokens required to talk to services that the launcher depends on.

Because of the nature of the agreements required to interact with the Microsoft identity platform, it's impossible for us to continue allowing everyone to build the code as 'MultiMC'. The source code has been debranded and now builds as `DevLauncher` by default.

You must provide your own branding if you want to distribute your own builds.

You will also have to register your own app on Azure to be able to handle Microsoft account logins.

If you decide to fork the project, a mention of its origins in the About dialog and the license is acceptable. However, it should be abundantly clear that the project is a fork *without* implying that you have our blessing.

yeah I made it again

Minecraft, but it's built on top of a deferred renderer.

![screenshot](images/screenshot.png)

Use the `Makefile` (`$ make`) to build (make **sure** you clone with submodules!). This won't support any platforms other than Mac OS, you'll need to modify `platform_glfw.cpp` yourself to add support.

PLEASE NOTE, this is just some reference code - I will not be supporting it, adding new platforms, fixing bugs, or anything like that - but feel free to browse :)

# LuckPerms
[![Build Status](https://ci.lucko.me/job/LuckPerms/badge/icon)](https://ci.lucko.me/job/LuckPerms/)

LuckPerms is a permissions plugin for Minecraft servers. It allows server admins to control what features players can use by creating groups and assigning permissions.

The latest downloads, wiki & other useful links can be found on the project homepage at [luckperms.net](https://luckperms.net/).

It is:

* **fast** - written with performance and scalability in mind.
* **reliable** - trusted by thousands of server admins, and the largest of server networks.
* **easy to use** - setup permissions using commands, directly in config files, or using the web editor.
* **flexible** - supports a variety of data storage options, and works on lots of different server types.
* **extensive** - a plethora of customization options and settings which can be changed to suit your server.
* **free** - available for download and usage at no cost, and permissively licensed so it can remain free forever.

For more information, see the wiki article on [Why LuckPerms?](https://luckperms.net/wiki/Why-LuckPerms)

## Building
LuckPerms uses Gradle to handle dependencies & building.

#### Requirements
* Java 8 JDK or newer
* Git

#### Compiling from source
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms.git
cd LuckPerms/
./gradlew build
```

You can find the output jars in the `loader/build/libs` or `build/libs` directories.

## Contributing
#### Pull Requests
If you make any changes or improvements to the plugin which you think would be beneficial to others, please consider making a pull request to merge your changes back into the upstream project. (especially if your changes are bug fixes!)

LuckPerms loosely follows the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Generally, try to copy the style of code found in the class you're editing. 

#### Project Layout
The project is split up into a few separate modules.

* **API** - The public, semantically versioned API used by other plugins wishing to integrate with and retrieve data from LuckPerms. This module (for the most part) does not contain any implementation itself, and is provided by the plugin.
* **Common** - The common module contains most of the code which implements the respective LuckPerms plugins. This abstract module reduces duplicated code throughout the project.
* **Bukkit, BungeeCord, Fabric, Forge, Nukkit, Sponge & Velocity** - Each use the common module to implement plugins on the respective server platforms.

## License
LuckPerms is licensed under the permissive MIT license. Please see [`LICENSE.txt`](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for more info.

51,overshard/docker-minecraft,Shell,"# docker-minecraft

A nice and easy way to get a Minecraft server up and running using docker. For
help on getting started with docker see the [official getting started guide][0].
For more information on Minecraft and check out it's [website][1].


## Building docker-minecraft

Running this will build you a docker image with the latest version of both
docker-minecraft and Minecraft itself.

    git clone https://github.com/overshard/docker-minecraft
    cd docker-minecraft
    sudo docker build -t overshard/minecraft .


## Running docker-minecraft

Running the first time will set your port to a static port of your choice so
that you can easily map a proxy to. If this is the only thing running on your
system you can map the port to 25565 and no proxy is needed. i.e.
`-p=25565:25565` . If you want to enable the query protocol you need
to add another -p=25565:25565/udp to forward the UDP protocol on the
same port as well.
Also be sure your mounted directory on your host machine is
already created before running `mkdir -p /mnt/minecraft`.

    sudo docker run -d=true -p=25565:25565 -v=/mnt/minecraft:/data overshard/minecraft /start

From now on when you start/stop docker-minecraft you should use the container id
with the following commands. To get your container id, after you initial run
type `sudo docker ps` and it will show up on the left side followed by the
image name which is `overshard/minecraft:latest`.

    sudo docker start <container_id>
    sudo docker stop <container_id>


### Notes on the run command

 + `-v` is the volume you are mounting `-v=host_dir:docker_dir`
 + `overshard/minecraft` is simply what I called my docker build of this image
 + `-d=true` allows this to run cleanly as a daemon, remove for debugging
 + `-p` is the port it connects to, `-p=host_port:docker_port`

Minecraft Region Fixer
======================

By Alejandro Aguilera (Fenixin) 

Locates problems and tries to fix Minecraft worlds (or region files).

Minecraft Region Fixer tries to fix corrupted chunks in region files using old backup copies
of the Minecraft world. If you don't have a copy, you can eliminate the
corrupted chunks making Minecraft regenerate them.

It also scans the 'level.dat' file and the player '\*.dat' and tries to 
read them. If there are any problems it prints warnings. At the moment
it doesn't fix any problem in these files.

Web page:
https://github.com/Fenixin/Minecraft-Region-Fixer

Mincraft forums posts:
https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/server-support-and/1903200-minecraft-region-fixer
https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-tools/1261480-minecraft-region-fixer

Supported platforms
===================
This program only works with Python 3.x, and DOESN'T work with
python 2.x. There was a Windows .exe for older versions, but right
now you need to install the python interpreter to run this
program.

Notes
=====
Older versions of Minecraft had big problems when loading broken
worlds. Newer versions of Minecraft are improving the way
they deal with corruption and other things.

Region-Fixer still is useful for replacing chunks/regions with a 
backup, removing entities, or trying to see what's going wrong
with your world.


Usage
=====
You can read the program help running: ""python regionfixer.py --help""

For usage examples and more info visit the wiki:

Bugs, suggestions, feedback, questions
======================================
Suggestions and bugs should go to the github page:

Donations and sponsors
======================
Region-Fixer was created thanks to sponsors and donations. You can find
information about that in DONORS.txt


Contributors
============
See CONTRIBUTORS.txt


Warning
=======
This program has been tested with a lot of worlds, but there may exist 
bugs, so please, MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR WORLD BEFORE RUNNING it,
I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE OF WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR WORLD. Other way to say it 
is USE THIS TOOL AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Think that you are playing with your precious saved games :P .

Good luck! :)
"
53,MightyPirates/OpenComputers,Scala,"![Welcome to OpenComputers](assets/misc/banner.png)

OpenComputers is a Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers and robots to the game. The built-in computer implementation uses Lua 5.2 and is fully persistent. This means programs will continue running across reloads. For more information, please [see the wiki][wiki]. Feel invited to visit the [community forums][forums] or drop by in the [IRC channel #oc on esper.net][irc].

A few useful links:
* [Minecraft Forum Thread][mcf]
* [Downloads][releases]
* [Bug Tracker][issues]
* [Wiki][wiki]
* [Ingame Manual][ingame manual]
* [IRC][irc]
* [Community Forums][forums]

### Experimental Builds
You can find experimental builds [on the build server][github-actions]. Expect these to be generally more unstable than builds marked as releases. Use these **at your own risk**, but - when using the latest one - please *do* report bugs you encounter using them. Thanks!

## License / Use in Modpacks
This mod is [licensed under the **MIT license**](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/blob/master-MC1.7.10/LICENSE). All **assets are public domain**, unless otherwise stated; all are free to be distributed as long as the license / source credits are kept. This means you can use this mod in any mod pack **as you please**. I'd be happy to hear about you using it, though, just out of curiosity.

## Contributing
### Assets and Localizations
1. **Translations**  
   Translations to other languages are very much appreciated. You can find the localization files [in this folder][localizations]. If a localization you wanted to create already exists, please take the time to see if the present one is complete - the strings change every so often, invalidating some of the translations. If you start a fresh localization, please base it off of the English or German one, those are the 'master' localization files. If you add a new language, please also add it to [the pack.mcmeta][pack.mcmeta] file. Keep it sorted alphabetically, use the name and region Minecraft itself uses. If you don't know how to do that, that's OK, I'll do it later.
2. **Textures**  
   If you would like to contribute better textures for certain items or blocks, feel free to pull-request them. If you would like to contribute *alternative* textures, make it a resource pack, and post it on the forums, for example.
3. **Documentation**  
   Help with keeping the [wiki][] up to date would be *really* appreciated. If you notice anything amiss and know better, fix it. If you don't ask someone who does, then fix it. If you had a question answered, consider adding that information somewhere in the wiki where you would have expected to find that information.  
   There are also the files containing the ingame help [for programs][manpages] and [for blocks and items][manual], which could probably be much better than they are right now. Improvements to them, and new ones (e.g. for the libraries, such as `text` or `sides`) would help a lot. Thanks!
4. **Robot Names**  
   Robots get a random name when placed (unless set with an Anvil). The list the names are chose from [can be found here][robot names]. Feel free to pull request additional names! *However*: since the list has grown to a considerable length already, here are the two basic criteria for new names: it must either be a real or fictional robot, or an AI that at least *appears* to be self-aware.

### Bug fixes, features and scripts
1. **Bugs**  
   If you've found a bug, please report it in the [issue tracker][issues], after checking it has not been reported before - and possibly even fixed by now. If you think you can and have fixed it, feel free to do a pull request, I'll happily pull it if it looks all right to me - otherwise I'll gladly tell you what to change to get it merged.
2. **Features**  
   If you'd like to propose a new feature, take it to the [forums][] or the [issue tracker][issues]. If you'd like to contribute code that adds new features, please make sure to discuss the feature with me, first - again, the issue tracker is an OK place for this, there are a couple of feature requests there, already. Alternatively start a topic on the forums to discuss the feature, and / or stop by the [IRC][irc] to talk about it. Blind / unexpected feature pull requests might very well not make it, so save yourself some time by talking about it, first! Thanks.
3. **Scripts / Programs**  
   OpenComputers generates floppy disks in dungeon chests that can contain data from a selection of 'loot' directories. For example, the IRC client and OPPM (a package manager) are two programs that can be found on such loot disks. If you'd like to contribute a program that can be found this way, please have a look at [the loot readme][loot], which explains how to add custom loot. Simply pull request your loot!
4. **Core Scripts**  
   If you would like to contribute scripts to the ""core"" Lua code (which basically defines 'OpenOS'), please have a look at the [code conventions][] for Lua to save us all some time. Bug fixes are always welcome. Additional programs and features should be kept small. Bigger programs (rule of thumb: larger than 3KiB) should go onto loot disks.
5. **Drivers**  
   As of OC 1.4, mod interaction that was previously provided by OpenComponents it now fully integrated into OC itself. If you wish to contribute a driver for blocks from other mods, cool! Have a look at the [integration][] package to get an idea of how to structure modules and read the readme in that package for more information (in particular on additional criteria to get your PR merged).

#### Pull requests
The following are a few quick guidelines on pull requests. That is to say they are not necessarily *rules*, so there may be exceptions and all that. Just try to stick to those points as a baseline.
- Make sure your code is formatted properly.
- Make sure it builds and works.
- Try to keep your changes as minimal as possible. In particular, no whitespace changes in existing files, please.
- Feel free to code in Java, but don't be surprised if I convert it to Scala later on, if I feel it makes the code more concise ;-)
- When adding mod dependencies, keep them *weak*, i.e. make sure OC still works without that mod. Also, prefer adding a Gradle dependency over adding API class files to the repo.
- [Squash](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) your commits!

Also, and this should go without saying, your contributed code will also fall under OC's license, unless otherwise specified (in the super rare case of adding third-party stuff, add the according license information as a `LICENSE-???` file, please).

## Extending
### In your own mod
To use [the API][api] in your own mod, either get the API JAR from the [build server][github-actions], or if you're using [Gradle](http://gradle.org/), add a dependency to the maven repo:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url = ""http://maven.cil.li/"" }
}
dependencies {
    compile ""li.cil.oc:OpenComputers:MC1.7.10-1.5.+:api""
}
```
Adjust the version number accordingly to the version you'd like to build against.

To run the mod in your development environment, download the [`dev` JAR from the build server][dev-jar] and drop it into your development environment's `eclipse/mods` (Eclipse) or `run/mods` (IntelliJ IDEA) folder.

Alternatively, leave out the `api` classifier and you can build against the dev JAR directly. This way you don't have to add it to your mods folder, but you will have to add `-Dfml.coreMods.load=li.cil.oc.common.launch.TransformerLoader` to the VM options in your run configuration.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask, either in the [forums][] or in the [IRC][irc]!

### OpenComputers
Want to tinker with the mod itself? Here is how - for IntelliJ IDEA users.

**Important**
- Make sure you have the Gradle plugin enabled in IntelliJ IDEA (File->Settings->Plugins).
- Make sure you have the Scala plugin enabled.

Clone the repository, then in it run  
`gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`  
to setup the workspace, including assets and such, then  
`gradlew idea`  
to create an IntelliJ IDEA project.

Open the project and you will be asked to *import the Gradle project* (check your Event Log if you missed the pop-up). **Do so**. This will configure additionally referenced libraries.

For more specific instructions, read [Steps to run master MC1.7.10 from IDEA][idea_1.7.10]

In the case you wish to use Eclipse rather than IntelliJ IDEA, the process is mostly the same, except you must run `gradlew eclipse` rather than `gradlew idea`.

54,WildBamaBoy/minecraft-comes-alive,Java,"Minecraft Comes Alive
=====================
Minecraft Comes Alive (MCA) is a Minecraft mod that replaces Minecraft's villagers with normal player-like NPCs. It works in single player, LAN, and SMP.

Villagers can be interacted with - you can talk to them, ask them to follow you, set their home, give them gifts, etc. Interacting with people builds relationships. Get your relationship high enough and you will be able to marry someone.

After getting married, you will be able to have children who will do many chores for you such as: Farming, Fishing, Woodcutting, Hunting, and Mining.

Children will eventually grow up into adults. Adults can get married and have children of their own, and this cycle can repeat indefinitely!

## Dependencies
At runtime, MCA has no external dependencies other than Minecraft Forge.

For development, MCA depends on Lombok. It will be installed automatically when you set up your development environment. Install the Lombok plugin for your relevant IDE if you have trouble building in your IDE.

## Contributing

Hey creeps! These are couple PHP scripts that make it rather simple to display who is currently online on your Minecraft server.

== index.php

This script parses your server.log file generated by your Minecraft server and tells you:

  Who is online or offline
  When they were last logged on
  How many times they have logged on
  How long they have been logged on for this session
  Total time they have ever been on the server
  Most recent things said in chat
  Displays the actual face from their Minecraft skin (generated by avatar.php)

Just throw this file on a webserver, along with your server.log file.

Extra uses:
By adding '?total' to the end of the URL, you can sort the list by total time spent online in the server.
By adding '?chat' to the end of the URL, you can see the 30 most recent items said in the server chat!
(Example: http://yourserver.com/minecraft/index.php?total)

== avatar.php

This script magically pulls out the face of your Minecraft.net into a new PNG image of specified size.

Now supports local image caching!

== Minecraft Google Map

As a bonus, you can generate a map of your Minecraft world and use Google Maps API to view it. Check it out: https://github.com/brownan/Minecraft-Overviewer
Or use Tectonicus: http://triangularpixels.net/games/tectonicus/

== Changes
Changes made by Jaryth are as follows:

October 1th (2015):
  -Removed security bug

[![Join our Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/289587909051416579.svg?logo=discord&label=)](https://discord.gg/papermc)

A Minecraft server proxy with unparalleled server support, scalability,
and flexibility.

Velocity is licensed under the GPLv3 license.

## Goals

* A codebase that is easy to dive into and consistently follows best practices
  for Java projects as much as reasonably possible.
* High performance: handle thousands of players on one proxy.
* A new, refreshing API built from the ground up to be flexible and powerful
  whilst avoiding design mistakes and suboptimal designs from other proxies.
* First-class support for Paper, Sponge, and Forge. (Other implementations
  may work, but we make every endeavor to support these server implementations
  specifically.)
  
## Building

Velocity is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org). We recommend using the
wrapper script (`./gradlew`) as our CI builds using it.

It is sufficient to run `./gradlew build` to run the full build cycle.

## Running

Once you've built Velocity, you can copy and run the `-all` JAR from
`proxy/build/libs`. Velocity will generate a default configuration file
and you can configure it from there.

Alternatively, you can get the proxy JAR from the [downloads](https://papermc.io/downloads#Velocity)
page.

# Immersive Vehicles (Formerly Transport Simulator)
From the folks that brought you Minecraft Flight Simulator comes the all-new Immersive Vehicles mod!\
This mod is the result of over a year's worth of work and is the continuation and future of Minecraft Flight Simulator.

## Building From Source or Contributing
To build from source, you will need to do a few things.  These instructions assume you are on Windows.  If you are on Linux, you should be able to tell where your instructions differ and how to handle such differences.

<ol>
<li>Create a fork of this repository.  Git has tons of tutorials for this.</li>
<li>Ensure you have Git Bash installed.  While you can make updates and commits through the web interface, this is a Bad Idea and will lead to pain down the road.  Command line programs are your freind when coding.</li>
<li>Open Git Bash in the folder where you want to keep your code via the right-click option `Git Bash Here`.  Then do a `git clone URL`, where the URL is the one for your forked repository.  Git will download all your code and files locally to allow you to start programming.</li>
<li>Ensure you have the Java 8 JDK installed.  This is NOT the same as the Java 8 JRE program that you use to run most Java applications.  You will specifically need to install the JDK.  Check your progam files if you are un-sure.</li>
<li>If you just installed the JDK, you will need to update your `path`.  This is a System Environment Variable on Windows that tells it where to look for things.  You want to add the directory where the Java 8 JDK was installed (likely `C:\Program Files\Java\SomeJDKVersion\bin`.  If you already have Java 8 JRE installed, you will see it in this list.  Just remove that entry and replace it with the Java 8 JDK entry (the location should match except for one folder).  You know you have done this correctly if you can open your command prompt and type `javac` and get a result besides ""command not found"".  (Note, you will have to close and open Command Prompt to reflect any PATH changes.</li>
<li>Now that you have your Java set up, you can use the same Git Bash prompt inside the folder you just cloned to setup your workspace:</li>
<ul>
<li>If you are running Eclipse, run `./gradlew eclipse` and then `./gradlew genEclipseRuns`.  Then open your Eclipse program.  When it asks you for a ""workspace location"" do NOT pick any folder to do with code.  Just pick a folder somewhere where Eclipse can throw things and you can forget about.  Once this is done, you need to go into the menu and ""Import Gradle Project"".  Pick the folder where all your code was copied to and the files should show up in the editor.  To test them, you can click the little bug icon and then go to Debug Configurations->Java Application-runClient. Select this, and go to the Environment tab and delete the MC_VERSION entry.  Apply, close, and then select it for debugging and you're off to testing your code!</li>
<li>If you are using IDEA, import the build script (`build.gradle`) with IDEA then run the `genIntellijRuns` Gradle task when it finishes importing.</li>
<li>If you are running VSCode, run `./gradlew genVSCodeRuns`.  Then bug TurboDefender on the Discord to fill this section out.</li>
<li>If you aren't using any of these three, START DOING SO.  Notepad is not meant for coding.  Do you want a Bad Time?  I didn't think so.</li>
</ul>
<li>After making your code changes, use Git Bash to do a `git add -u` to add all modified files.  Then you can do a `git commit -m ""Message for what you commited""`. This marks the changes, and the reason for them.  Finally, do a `git push` to push the changes back up to Git.  From there, you can create a Pull Request and have your code be part of the mod!</li>
</ol>

60,trevor-laher/OnDemandMinecraft,Python,"# On Demand Minecraft Server
Using a Python Flask application and AWS, this repository launches an AWS EC2 Instance to host a Minecraft server upon request from users through the web application. The server will automatically shut down after the server has crashed or is empty for 15 minutes. This makes server hosting for small communities very inexpensive. For up to 20 players you can expect $0.02 per hour the server runs. The largest benefit of this system is that the server bill diminishes if your community decides to take a break from the game, and will be ready to pick back up when you want to play again. No subscriptions are required.

Note that this configuration will likely require familiarity with programming, SSH, and the command line.


# AWS Setup
This step will properly configure your AWS account and configuration.py file so that an instance can be created via the createInstance.py script.

 1. Create or access an **AWS Account**. Under the **User Dropdown** in the    **Toolbar**, select **Security Credentials**, then **Access Keys**, and finally **Create New Access Key**. Download this file, open it, and copy the values of **AWSAccessKeyId** and **AWSSecretKey** to **ACCESS_KEY** and **SECRET_KEY** in the **configuration.py** file in the root directory of the repository.
	
	<code>ACCESS_KEY = 'YourAWSAccessKeyIdHere'
	SECRET_KEY  =  'YourAWSSecretKeyHere'</code> 

 3. Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard** under the **Services Dropdown** and select **Security Groups** in the sidebar. Select **Create Security Group**, input **minecraft** for the **Security group name**. Create **Inbound Rules** for the following:
	 - Type: **SSH** Protocol: **TCP** Port Range: **22** Source: **Anywhere**
	 - Type: **Custom TCP Rule** Protocol: **TCP** Port Range: **25565** Source: **Anywhere**
	 - Type: **Custom UDP Rule** Protocol: **UDP** Port Range: **25565** Source: **Anywhere**
	 
	 In **configuration.py** in the root directory, set **ec2_secgroups** to the name of the security group.
	 
	 <code>ec2_secgroups =  ['YourGroupNameHere']</code>

3. Under the **EC2 Dashboard** navigate to **Key Pairs** in the sidebar. Select **Create Key Pair**, provide a name and create. Move the file that is downloaded into the root directory of the project. In **configuration.py** in the root directory, set ** ec2_keypair** to the name entered, and **SSH_KEY_FILE_NAME** to the name.pem of the file downloaded.

	THIS MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE
		<code>ec2_keypair =  'YourKeyPairName'
		SSH_KEY_FILE_PATH  =  './YourKeyFileName.pem'</code>

4. This step is concerned with creating the AWS instance. View [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) (Or google AWS Regions), and copy the  **Region** column for the **Region Name** of where you wish to host your server. In **configuration.py** of the root directory, set the **ec2_region** variable to the copied value.

	<code>ec2_region =  ""Your-Region-Here""</code>

5. Navigate to [https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) and select one of the T3 types (with the memory and CPU you desire, I recommend 10 players/GB). Copy the value in the **Model** column. I've configured mine to use **t3.small**. In **configuration.py** of the root directory, set the **ec2_instancetype** variable to the copied value.

	<code>ec2_instancetype =  't3.yourSizeHere'</code>

6. Then we must select an image for the instance to boot. Navigate to [https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/), in the filter at the bottom of the screen, select your region of choice under **Zone**, pick any LTS (Latest Stable) under **Version**, under **Arch** select **amd64**, and **hvm:ebs** under **Instance Type**. Select one of the images available and copy the **AMI-ID**. In **configuration.py** of the root directory, set the **ec2_amis** variable to the copied value.

	<code>ec2_amis =  ['ami-YourImageIdHere']</code>

7. At this point you should have the necessary configuration to create a new instance through the **createInstance.py** script in the **root** folder. Open a command line in the utilityScripts directory of the project, and execute:

	<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
	
	After successful installation of dependencies execute:

	<code>python utilityScripts/createInstance.py</code>

	Copy the **Instance ID** that is output into the terminal. In **configuration.py** of the root directory, set the **INSTANCE_ID** variable to the copied value.

	<code>INSTANCE_ID  =  'i-yourInstanceIdHere'</code>


# Web Application Deployment
In this step the project will get deployed to Heroku's free hosting. This part of the application provides a rudimentary UI and Web URL for users to start the server.

Before deployment it will be important to set the password for the server to start. In **configuration.py** of the root directory, set the **SERVER_PASSWORD** variable to the password of your choosing.

   <code>SERVER_PASSWORD='YourPasswordHere'</code>
 1. Create or have access to a Heroku account.
 2. Install and setup the **Heroku CLI** onto your computer. [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)
 3. In the command line for the directory of this project, type:
	 <code>heroku create YourProjectNameHere</code>
4. Once this new project has been created, it is time to push the project to Heroku.
	<code>git push heroku master</code>
5. The URL to your hosted site should be: YourProjectNameHere.herokuapp.com
6. Access your site and launch/access your server!

# AWS Instance Configuration
This step will configure the AWS Linux server to run the minecraft server. It will include SSH connecting to the server, gaining admin privileges, installing java, directory setup, moving shell scripts onto the server, and making a CRON job for these shell scripts. Note that this step will include both an SSH client and a File Transfer client (such as FileZilla) on your PC.
1. The first step will be to get SSH into the server instance. Using the key downloaded from AWS in the section above, add this key to PuTTY or simply access it through command line. The IP address can be obtained by entering the server password on the site, or through the EC2 Dashboard, selecting the iPV4 address from the corresponding instanceID in your configuration file. For MacOS and Linux systems

	<code>ssh -i pathToYourKeyFileHere ubuntu@IPAddress</code>

2. Make the ubuntu user admin if it isn't already with:
 
	<code>adduser ubuntu sudo</code>

3. The next step will be to install JavaJDK onto your system. For newer versions you may enter:
	<code>sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk-headless</code>
	If this doesn't work you can use <code>sudo apt list</code> and search through these packages for an alternative java version.

4. Open up an FTP client such as FileZilla and connect to the same address as the same user with the same IP address. Drag all files from the **instanceSetup** folder from this repository, into the root directory of the current user (probably **ubuntu**, for the purposes of these commands I will be using **ubuntu**, but feel free to replace with your own user if appropriate).

5.  Download the desired Minecraft server version from [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/), rename it **server.jar** and drag it into the root directory of the user using FileZilla.

6. Using the FTP client, create a new folder in the root directory of the current user called **screens**  
OR  
In the SSH client, create a folder in the current directory with the command:
	<code>sudo mkdir screens</code>
7. Then execute the following command:
   <code>sudo chmod 700 /home/ubuntu</code>
8. Then execute the next command:
  <code>export SCREENDIR=/home/ubuntu/screens</code>
9. Then execute the command:
  <code>sudo crontab /home/ubuntu/crontab -u ubuntu</code>

	Feel free to close the server through the AWS console or execute the command:
	<code>sudo /sbin/shutdown -P +1</code>

At this point you may restart the server from the Web Application using the password you configured. You should then be able to play!

# Additional Remarks
## Minecraft Memory Configuration
The server startup command does not specify memory constraints by default, but is available to be specified in Configuration.py. In the event that you configure this from an empty string, **the trailing space is required** as in the example below. Traditional minecraft server flags apply for this configuration.
<code>MEMORY_ALLOCATION='-Xmx1024M -Xms1024M '</code>
## UI Configuration
The title and header for the site can be changed in **/templates/index.html**. Feel free to add any more content or styling to the site, though be careful not to change any form, input, button, or script elements in the template.

## Server Maintenance
Maintaining the server is fairly straightforward and is done primarily through FileZilla. Updating the server file can be done by downloading the new server file, renaming it to **server.jar** and replacing the old file on the server. The world file can be backed up to your PC manually though there is no automated process at this time.

Subscribe to [the newsletter][1] for important updates and project news.

## Installation

There are several ways to obtain Cuberite.

### Binaries

- The easiest method is downloading for Windows or Linux from the [website][2].
- You can use the EasyInstall script for Linux and macOS, which automatically downloads the correct binary. The script is described below.

#### The EasyInstall script

This script will download the correct binary from the project site.

    curl -sSfL https://download.cuberite.org | sh

### Compiling

- You can compile automatically for Linux, macOS and FreeBSD with the `compile.sh` script. The script is described below.
- You can also compile manually. See [COMPILING.md][4].

Compiling may provide better performance (1.5-3x as fast) and it supports more operating systems.

#### The compile.sh script

This script downloads the source code and compiles it. The script is smart enough to notify you of missing dependencies and instructing you on how to install them. The script doesn't work for Windows.

Using curl:

    sh -c ""$(curl -sSfL -o - https://compile.cuberite.org)""

Or using wget:

    sh -c ""$(wget -O - https://compile.cuberite.org)""

Web based Minecraft chat client for 1.8 servers.

![MinecraftChat Screenshot](http://puu.sh/hwR1L/9e88547904.png)

### Description
This is a very lightweight application... ~500kb without modules. It is built on Node and utilizes tools such as [mineflayer](https://github.com/andrewrk/mineflayer), [node-minecraft-protocol](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol#windows) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/). The whole purpose is that you can chat on Minecraft servers from your browser. This makes it easier to just jump in, say a few things, and leave without having to wait for your game to load.

### Installing on your own server
```
git clone https://github.com/AlexKvazos/MinecraftChat
cd MinecraftChat
npm install && grunt build
npm start
```

This will start the application on port `3000` or the one specified by the `PORT`environment variable.

### Grunt tasks

* `grunt debug` - Builds the client-side javascript application with no minification
* `grunt build` - Builds the client-side javascript application with minification
* `grunt watch` - Automatically runs `grunt debug` when client-side code changes
* `grunt server` - Starts server and automatically restart when server-side code changes

* From [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk)'s ashes here comes PojavLauncher!

* PojavLauncher is a launcher that allows you to play Minecraft:Java Edition on your Android device!

* It can run almost every version of the Minecraft, allowing you to use .jar only installers to install modloaders like [forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/), [fabric](http://fabricmc.net/), [optifine](https://optifine.net); Utility and hack clients like [LabyMod](https://www.labymod.net/en), [Wurst](https://www.wurstclient.net/) and much more!

* For more details [check out our wiki](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/wiki)

* This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions ranging from rd-132211 to 1.19 snapshots (including Combat Test versions). 
* Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported. 
* This repository contains source code for Android. 
* For iOS/iPadOS, check out [PojavLauncher_iOS](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS).

## Getting PojavLauncher

Getting PojavLauncher is divided into 3 parts.

1. You can get prebuilt app from [stable releases](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/releases) or [automatic builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/actions).

2. You can get it from Google Play by clicking:
[![Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kdt.pojavlaunch)

3. You can [build](#building) from source.
## Building
If you want to build after launcher code changes, follow the steps below.
### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- JRE for Android is [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/openjdk-multiarch-jdk8u), and the build script is [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch).
- Follow build instruction on build script [README.md](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/blob/buildjre8/README.md).
- You can also get [CI auto builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/actions) if you are lazy or failing it for some reason.
* Either get `jre8-pojav` artifact from auto builds, or do splitting by yourself:</br>
   - Get JREs for all of 4 supported architectures (arm, arm64, x86, x86_64) </br> 
      - Split JRE into parts:</br>
                Platform-independent: .jar files, libraries, configs, etc...</br>
                Platform-dependent: .so files, etc...</br>
        - Create:</br>
                A file named `universal.tar.xz` with all platform-independent files</br>
                4 files named `bin-<arch>.tar.xz` with all platform-dependent files per-architecture</br>
        - Put these in `assets/components/jre/` folder</br>
        - (If needed) update the Version file with the current date</br>

### LWJGL
- **Coming soon**

### The Launcher
- Because languages are auto added by Crowdin, you need to run language list generator before building. In the project directory, run:

* On Linux, Mac OS:
```
chmod +x scripts/languagelist_updater.sh
bash scripts/languagelist_updater.sh
```
* On Windows:
```
scripts\languagelist_updater.bat
```
Then, run these commands ~~or build using Android Studio~~.

* Build GLFW stub:
```
./gradlew :jre_lwjgl3glfw:build
```       
* Build the launcher
```
./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug
```
(Replace `gradlew` to `gradlew.bat` if you are building on Windows).

## Downloads
- There are two versions, modded and vanilla, where vanilla doesn't have the option to turn on mods
- [Windows 32 bit](https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC/releases)
- [Windows 64 bit](https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC/releases)
- [MacOS x86_64](https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC/releases)
- [MacOS ARM](https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC/releases)

## Building
Note: if you would like to build the vanilla version, remove `-DMINECRAFTC_MODS=1` from the cmake command
### Requirements:
- `git`
- `cmake`
- A compiler of your choice

### Windows instructions for Visual Studio:
1. Run the following commands:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC.git
cd MinecraftC
mkdir Build
cd Build
cmake -DMINECRAFTC_MODS=1 -G""Visual Studio 17"" .. # replace ""Visual Studio 17"" with your version
```
2. You should now have `MinecraftC.sln` in your directory that you can open with Visual Studio and build

### MacOS instructions for Xcode:
1. Run the following commands:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC.git
cd MinecraftC
mkdir Build && cd Build
cmake -DMINECRAFTC_MODS -GXcode ..
```
2. You should now have `MinecraftC.xcodeproj` in your directory that you open with Xcode and build

3. (optional) If you would like it in a .app format, you can run this command to convert your executable:
```
python3 Scripts/MacOS-App.py <path-to-executable> [developer-id]
```
Providing the developer id will sign the .app, which you can find by running `security find-identity`

### Linux instructions (untested):
1. If you don't have SDL2 already, run these commands:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```
2. Run the following commands:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC.git
cd MinecraftC
mkdir Build && cd Build
cmake -DMINECRAFTC_MODS=1 ..
make
```

### Modifying Resources
If you're creating a mod and want to change or add any `.png` or `.ogg` resouces, then run this script to update the resource headers:
```sh
python3 Scripts/EmbedResources.py
```
It will recursively go through all `.png` and `.ogg` files in `Resources/`, and convert them to `.h`

## Known Issues
- There is no survival mode, it was removed for simplicity and compatibility with raytracing
- A few sounds have the incorrect pitch, I'm waiting for cute_sound.h to implement pitch shifting
- Load file and save file are not implemented
- If raytracing doesn't turn on, then something is going wrong with OpenCL, report an issue and I can help troubleshoot

====================
**This project is dead, go find paper at [papermc.io](https://papermc.io/)**


This project hasn't been updated in at least 5 years, Minecraft is a totally different beast that the one this project was intending to modify. It was super fun while it lasted, thanks for stopping by.


hMod is a server mod for the Minecraft Beta server software. This is only the source code, if you don't know how to use this you won't find it useful.

Compiling
---------
Add a new project from existing sources in whatever IDE you use. Add minecraft_servero.jar as a library, and mysql-connector-java-bin.jar if need be. Your IDE should compile .class files that you can copy over into a clean minecraft_server.jar, then you can test your changes.


minecraft_servero.jar
---------
You can get this file by running jarjar.bat in the jarjar folder and it will automaticly make minecraft_servero.jar

# How to build
Dynmap 3.x+ uses Gradle for building support for all platforms, with all resulting artifacts produced in the /targets directory.  Due to Minecraft 1.18.x+ requirements, the developer's
default JDK must be a JDK 17 (or later) versions - older versions will still be compiled
to run on the default JDK for those platforms (JDK 8, or JDK 16 for 1.17.x), and common libraries are built JDK 8.

To build and get all jars in `target/`, run:

    ./gradlew setup build
    
Or (on Windows):

    gradlew.bat setup build
    
The Forge 1.12.2 versions (specifically ForgeGradle for these) are very sensitive to being built by JDK 8, so to build them, 
set JAVA_HOME to correspond to a JDK 8 installation, then build using the following;

    cd oldgradle
    ./gradlew setup build
    
Or (on Windows):

    cd oldgradle
    gradlew.bat setup build

Those familiar with gradle can save time by specifying a build (or commenting in settings.gradle) BUT this is not suitable for uploading DEV code changes.

NOTE: PR code submissions MUST be built and TESTED for ALL platforms (including oldgradle), or be rejected and negatively influence future approvals. 
For more check [contributing rules](#contributing-to-dynmaps-code).

    ./gradlew :fabric-1.18:build

# Data Storage
Dynmap supports the following storage backends:
- Flat files: The default for a new installation
- MySQL†
- SQLite†
- PostgreSQL (JDBC driver for this is now bundled with the Dynmap JAR)
- MariaDB - is compatible with MySQL
- AWS S3 (allows S3 bucket to be used for storage AND as web site host)
- †Note: drivers for SQL are usually included for Spigot and its derivatives but not included with other platforms or Dynmap. For Forge and Fabric servers we recommend Kosma's [SQLite mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sqlite-jdbc) or [MySQL mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mysql-jdbc) to add the needed drivers. Additionally, injecting driver classes into jar file will be recognized and supported.

# Contributing to Dynmap's Code
The Dynmap team welcomes Pull Requests with fixes, new features, and new platform support.  That said, the following rules apply:
- Ultimately, we reserve the right to accept or deny a PR for any reason: fact is, by accepting it, we're also accepting any of the problems with supporting it,
explaining it to users, and fixing current and future problems - if we don't think the PR is of value consistent with that cost, we'll probably not accept it.
- All PRs should be as small as they can be to accomplish the feature or fix being supplied.  To that end:
   - Do not lump multiple features into one PR - you'll be asked to split them up before they will be reviewed or accepted
   - Do not make style changes, reflow code, pretty printing, or otherwise make formatting-only code changes.  This makes the PR excessively large, 
   creating changes to be reviewed that don't actually do anything (but we have to review them to be sure they aren't being used to disguise security 
   compromises or other malicious code), and they create problems with the MANY people who fork Dynmap for the sake of doing PRs or their own private
   custom builds - since all theose modified lines create merge conflicts - once again, with no actual function having been accomplished.  If we decide
   the code needs to be 'prettied up', it'll be done by the Dynmap team.
- Do not make changes to core code (anything in DynmapCore or DynmapCoreAPI) unless you're ready to build and test it on all supported platforms.  Code that
breaks building of ANY supported platform will be rejected.
- Likewise, any Spigot related changes are expected to function correctly on all supported Spigot and PaperMC versions (currently 1.10.2 through 1.18.1).  
- Do not include any code that involves platform specific native libraries or command line behaviors.  Dynmap supports 32-bit and 64-bit, Windows, lots of
Linux versions (both x86 and ARM), MacOS, being used in Docker environments, and more - this is all about staying as 'pure Java' as the Minecraft server itself
is.  If your PR includes platform specific dependencies that are not coded to handle working on all the above platforms properly, the PR will be rejected.
- Dynmap's code is Apache Public License v2 - do not include any code that is not compatible with this license.  By contributing code, you are agreeing to
that code being subject to the APL v2.
- Do not include any code that unconditionally adds to Dynmap's hosting requirements - for example, support for a database can be added, but the use of the
database (which likely depends on a database server being deployed and configured by the user) cannot become an unconditional requirement in order to run
Dynmap.  Features can add the option to exploit new or additional technologies, but cannot add unconditionally to the minimum requirements on the supported
platforms (which is what is needed to run the corresponding MC server, plus the Dynmap plugin or mod)
- Dynmap is built and supports running on Java 8 - it can run on newer versions, but any contributed code and dependencies MUST support being compiled and run
using just Java 8.
- Don't introduce other language dependencies - Java only: no Kotlin, Scala, JRuby, whatever. They just add runtime dependencies that most of the platforms lack,
and language skills above and beyond the Java language requirements the code base already mandates, which just creates obstacles to other people contributing.
- Similarly, do not update existing libraries and dependencies - these are often tied to the versions on various platforms, and updates will likely break runtime
- Do not include code specific to other plugins or mods.  Dynmap has APIs for the purpose of avoiding the problem of working with other mods - there are many 
'Dynmap-XXX' mods and plugins which use the APIs to provide support for other mods and plugins (WorldGuard, Nucleus, Citizens, dozens of others).  Maintaining
interfaces in Dynmap particular to dozens of mods on multiple versions of multiple platforms is unmanageable, so we don't do it.  The ONLY exception currently
are security mods - although, even for those, leverage of platform-standard security interfaces is always preferred (e.g. Sponge or Bukkit standard permissions)

# Porting, Supporting Other Platforms, Customized Dynmap Builds
While Dynmap is open source, subject to the Apache Public License, v2, the Dynmap team does have specific policies and requirements for anyone that would
use the code here for anything except building contributions submitted back to this code base as Pull Requests (which is the only process by which code is accepted and can become part of a release supported by the Dynmap team).  Other authorized uses include:

- Building custom version of Dynmap for use on a personal or on a specific server, so long as this version is NOT distributed to other parties. 
The modifying team agrees to not pursue support from the Dynmap team for this modified private version, but is otherwise not required to share the 
modified source code - though doing so is encouraged.
- Building a modified version of Dynmap for otherwise unsupported platforms: in this event, the modified version MUST be for a platform or version 
not yet (or no longer) supported by the Dynmap team.  If the Dynmap team comes to support this platform or version, the modifying team must agree to
cease distribution of the unofficial version, unless otherwise authorized to continue doing so.  Further:
    - The team distributing the modified version must cite the origin of the Dynmap code, but must also clearly indicate that the version is NOT supported by
    nor endorsed by the Dynmap team, and that ALL support should be directed through the team providing the modified version.
    - Any modified version CANNOT be monetized or otherwise charged for, under any circumstances, nor can redistribution of it be limited or restricted.
    - The modified code must continue to be Apache Public License v2, with no additional conditions or restrictions, including full public availability of the
    modified source code.
    - Any code from Dynmap used in such versions should be built from an appropriate fork, as DynmapCore and other components (other than DynmapCoreAPI and 
    dynmap-api) are subject to breaking changes at any time, and the support messages in DynmapCore MUST be modified to refer to the supporting team (or, at
    least, removed).  The modified version should NOT refer to the Dynmap Discord nor to /r/Dynmap on Reddit for support. in any case.
    - Any bugs or issues opened in conjunction with the use of the modified version on this repository will be closed without comment.

Additions of new functions, including new platform support, in this official Dynmap code base MUST be fully contained within the PRs submitted to this 
repository.  Further, it is always expected than any updates will be built and tested across all relevant platforms - meaning any chances to shared code 
components (DynmapCore, DynmapCoreAPI) MUST be successfully built and tested on ALL supported platforms (Forge, Spigot, etc).  Changes which break 
supported platforms will be rejected.

The only interfaces published and maintained as 'stable' are the interfaces of the DynmapCoreAPI (cross platform) and dynmap-api (Bukkit/spigot specific) 
libraries.  All other components are NOT libraries - DynmapCore, in particular, is a shared code component across the various platforms, but is subject to 
breaking changes without warning or consideration - any use of DynmapCore interfaces by code outside this repository is NOT supported, and will likely 
result in breaking of such consuming code without warning and without apology.  DynmapCore is an internal shared code component, not a library - please
treat it accordingly.

Plugins or mods using the published APIs - DynmapCoreAPI (for all platforms) or dynmap-api (only for Spigot/Bukkit) - may access these components as 
'compile' dependencies: DO NOT INTEGRATE THEM INTO YOUR PLUGIN - this will break Dynmap and/or other plugins when these interfaces are updated or 
expanded.  These libraries are published at https://repo.mikeprimm.com and will be updated each official release.

====================
**This project is dead, go find paper at [papermc.io](https://papermc.io/)**


This project hasn't been updated in at least 5 years, Minecraft is a totally different beast that the one this project was intending to modify. It was super fun while it lasted, thanks for stopping by.


hMod is a server mod for the Minecraft Beta server software. This is only the source code, if you don't know how to use this you won't find it useful.

Compiling
---------
Add a new project from existing sources in whatever IDE you use. Add minecraft_servero.jar as a library, and mysql-connector-java-bin.jar if need be. Your IDE should compile .class files that you can copy over into a clean minecraft_server.jar, then you can test your changes.


minecraft_servero.jar
---------
You can get this file by running jarjar.bat in the jarjar folder and it will automaticly make minecraft_servero.jar

73,mapcrafter/mapcrafter,C++,"# Mapcrafter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mapcrafter/mapcrafter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mapcrafter/mapcrafter) #

**For Minecraft 1.13, see issue [#113](https://github.com/mapcrafter/mapcrafter/issues/275). TL;DR: Minecraft 1.13 support is pretty much complete, few small features and full documentation are still in progress. Can be built from source from `world113` branch or [nightly packages](https://mapcrafter.org/downloads/nightly) can be used.**

by Moritz Hilscher

*Due to my university studies and other projects, unfortunately I'm not able to develop new features for Mapcrafter anymore. I'll try to keep up with the issues on GitHub from time to time, so if you're experiencing a problem, don't mind reporting it. You can still submit feature requests in case I or someone else decides to do some work on Mapcrafter. I'm happy about PRs too. If you want to work on Mapcrafter and need help with something just ask me (Mail, IRC, GitHub), I can tell you a bit about how the project is structured.*

Mapcrafter is a high performance Minecraft map renderer written in C++. It renders
Minecraft worlds to a bunch of images which are viewable in any webbrowser
using Leaflet.js.

Mapcrafter is free software and available under the GPL license.  You can
access the latest source code of Mapcrafter on GitHub:
http://github.com/mapcrafter/mapcrafter

Thanks to pigmap and Minecraft Overviewer, whose documentations and source code
were very helpful. I also used the alpha blending code of pigmap and some maps
stuff of the template from Minecraft Overviewer.

<div align=""center"">
    <img src=""http://i.imgur.com/WyKXrgO.png"" />
</div>

## Features ##

* **Web output:** Render your Minecraft worlds to maps viewable in any webbrowser!
* **Different render views:** Choose between different perspectives to render your world
  from! A 2D topdown and a 3D isometric render view are available!
* **Different rotations:** Choose from four different rotations to render your worlds from!
* **Different render modes:** Choose between different render modes like day, night and cave 
  for your maps!
* **Different overlays:** Show additional information on your map! For example: Where can
  slimes spawn? Where can monsters spawn at night?
* **Configuration files:** Highly-customizable which worlds are rendered with which render
  view and other render parameters!
* **Markers:** Automatically generated markers from your Minecraft world data!
* **Other stuff:** Biome colors, incremental rendering, multithreading

## Requirements ##

* A Linux-based or Unix-like operating system like Mac OS
* A decent C++ compiler (preferable gcc >= 4.4, or clang), CMake and make if you want to build
      Mapcrafter from source
* Some libraries:
  * libpng
  * libjpeg (but you should use libjpeg-turbo as drop in replacement)
  * libboost-iostreams
  * libboost-system
  * libboost-filesystem (>= 1.42)
  * libboost-program-options
  * (libboost-test if you want to use the tests)
* For your Minecraft worlds:
  * Anvil world format
  * Minecraft 1.6 resource packs

## Examples ##

There are a few example maps of the renderer on the [GitHub
Wiki](https://github.com/mapcrafter/mapcrafter/wiki/Example-maps).  Please feel free
to add your own map to this list.

## Documentation and Help ##

The documentation is in the `docs/` directory and you can build it yourself
with Sphinx. You can read a built version of the documentation on
[docs.mapcrafter.org](http://docs.mapcrafter.org) and you can also [download
other builds](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mapcrafter/downloads/).

If you find bugs or problems when using Mapcrafter or if you have ideas for new
features, then please feel free to add an issue to the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/mapcrafter/mapcrafter/issues).

You can contact me in IRC (#mapcrafter on Freenode). Use the 
[webclient](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mapcrafter>) if you
are new to IRC. I will be there most of the time, but please bear in mind
that I can't be available all the time. If I'm not there, wait some time or 
try another time of the day.

You can also ask questions in the [Minecraft Forum
thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1632003-mapcrafter-fast-minecraft-map-renderer/).

* Not a coder? [Post an issue][issues] with your idea for MSM instead.
* Read the [changelog][changelog] to get a picture of how MSM has evolved over time.

MSM is released under the GPLv3 licence, which is included in the repository [here][licence]. I'm open to suggestions where licencing is concerned.

## Features

As well as starting, stopping and restarting MSM has the following features:

* One script handles multiple servers, run two or more servers on one machine.
* Can create and start new servers with a single command, downloads the jars for you.
* Periodically makes [WorldEdit snapshot][we-snapshot] compatible backups of your worlds.
* Backup the entire server directory for complete protection.
* Load world's into RAM for faster access (reduces lag).
* Easily configurable global defaults, with per server overrides if needed.
* Apply server commands to one, multiple, or all servers in one go (useful for whitelisting a player on all servers.)
* Tab completion for all commands, makes everything faster and getting started a breeze.
* Keep server logs organsied by periodically ""rolling"" them.
* Organises jar files into groups (such as minecraft and craftbukkit) and links each server to a single jar. Includes automated download of new versions.
* Plethora of in-game commands (whitelist, blacklist, operator, gamemode, kick, say, time, toggledownfall, save)
* Send commands straight to the server via the command line.

## Support

1. If you find a problem with MSM and you think the problem is one that requires changing code [submit an issue][issues] via GitHub.

## Upcoming features

* **QuickBackup:** If you store your backups non-locally (maybe on a NAS), QuickBackup optionally creates a backup locally for speed, and then moves it after your players are building again! My initial testing shows a 54 second network backup confaltes to 23 seconds of in-game time.
* **Restore:** Roll-back to an old world or whole server backup automatically.


## Versioning

MSM uses semantic version numbers to better describe what code one might have installed, and indicate backwards incompatible changes.

Releases will be numbered in the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

For more information on SemVer, visit http://semver.org/.

# Sodium (for Fabric)
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric.svg)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric.svg)
![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric.svg)

Sodium is a free and open-source optimization mod for the Minecraft client that improves frame rates, reduces
micro-stutter, and fixes graphical issues in Minecraft. 

:warning: Sodium has had a lot of time to shape up lately, but the mod is still alpha software. You may run into minor
graphical issues or crashes while using it. Additionally, the
[Fabric Rendering API](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/documentation:rendering) is not yet supported, which may cause crashes
and other issues with some mods.

---

## Installation

### Manual installation (recommended)

You will need Fabric Loader 0.10.x or newer installed in your game in order to load Sodium. If you haven't installed
Fabric mods before, you can find a variety of community guides for doing so [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install).

#### Stable releases

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric.svg)

The latest releases of Sodium are published to our [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) and
[GitHub release](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/releases) pages. Releases are considered by our team to be
**suitable for general use**, but they are not guaranteed to be free of bugs and other issues.

Usually, releases will be made available on GitHub slightly sooner than other locations.

#### Bleeding-edge builds (unstable)

[![GitHub build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/gradle-ci/1.17.x/dev)](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

If you are a player who is looking to get your hands on the latest **bleeding-edge changes for testing**, consider
taking a look at the automated builds produced through our [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml?query=event%3Apush).
This workflow automatically runs every time a change is pushed to the repository, and as such, the builds it produces
will generally reflect the latest snapshot of development.

Bleeding edge builds will often include unfinished code that hasn't been extensively tested. That code may introduce
incomplete features, bugs, crashes, and all other kinds of weird issues. You **should not use these bleeding edge builds**
unless you know what you are doing and are comfortable with software debugging. If you report issues using these builds,
we will expect that this is the case. Caveat emptor.

### CurseForge

[![CurseForge downloads](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_394468_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium)

If you are using the CurseForge client, you can continue to find downloads through our
[CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium). Unless you are using the CurseForge
client, you should prefer the downloads linked on our Modrinth or GitHub release pages above.

---

### Reporting Issues

You can report bugs and crashes by opening an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues).
Before opening a new issue, use the search tool to make sure that your issue has not already been reported and ensure
that you have completely filled out the issue template. Issues that are duplicates or do not contain the necessary
information to triage and debug may be closed. 

Please note that while the issue tracker is open to feature requests, development is primarily focused on
improving hardware compatibility, performance, and finishing any unimplemented features necessary for parity with
the vanilla renderer.

### Community
[![Discord chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat%20on-discord-7289DA?logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://jellysquid.me/discord)

We have an [official Discord community](https://jellysquid.me/discord) for all of our projects. By joining, you can:
- Get installation help and technical support with all of our mods 
- Be notified of the latest developments as they happen
- Get involved and collaborate with the rest of our team
- ... and just hang out with the rest of our community.

---

### Building from sources

Support is not provided for setting up build environments or compiling the mod. We ask that
users who are looking to get their hands dirty with the code have a basic understanding of compiling Java/Gradle
projects. The basic overview is provided here for those familiar.

#### Requirements

- JRE 8 or newer (for running Gradle)
- JDK 8 (optional)
  - If you neither have JDK 8 available on your shell's path or installed through a supported package manager (such as
[SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io)), Gradle will automatically download a suitable toolchain from the [AdoptOpenJDK project](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
and use it to compile the project. For more information on what package managers are supported and how you can
customize this behavior on a system-wide level, please see [Gradle's Toolchain user guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html).
- Gradle 6.7 or newer (optional)
  - The [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:using_wrapper) is provided in
    this repository can be used instead of installing a suitable version of Gradle yourself. However, if you are building
    many projects, you may prefer to install it yourself through a suitable package manager as to save disk space and to
    avoid many different Gradle daemons sitting around in memory.

#### Building with Gradle

Sodium uses a typical Gradle project structure and can be built by simply running the default `build` task. After Gradle
finishes building the project, you can find the build artifacts (typical mod binaries, and their sources) in
`build/libs`.

**Tip:** If this is a one-off build, and you would prefer the Gradle daemon does not stick around in memory afterwards,
try adding the [`--no-daemon` flag](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon)
to ensure that the daemon is torn down after the build is complete. However, subsequent builds of the project will
[start more slowly](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:why_the_daemon) if the Gradle
daemon is not available to be re-used.


Build artifacts ending in `dev` are outputs containing the sources and compiled classes
before they are remapped into stable intermediary names. If you are working in a developer environment and would
like to add the mod to your game, you should prefer to use the `modRuntime` or `modCompile` configurations provided by
Loom instead of these outputs.

========

MobArena is an arena-style minigame for Spigot-based Minecraft servers


## Getting Started

If you don't want to compile the plugin yourself, grab a release artifact from 
one of these two sites:

- [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/mobarena)
- [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34110/)

The wiki here on Github should have all the information you need to get 
started using the plugin.


## Getting Help

If you run into problems or need help with something, feel free to hop on the
MobArena Discord server to have a chat: [Instant Invite](https://discord.gg/5tnwQvC)

Remember, though, that this communication channel is _idle chat_, which
means you likely won't get a response immediately. It could take anything from
a couple of seconds to a day, but your message _will_ be seen.

[![](https://github.com/itzg/minecraft-server-charts/workflows/Release%20Charts/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/itzg/minecraft-server-charts/actions)

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add itzg https://itzg.github.io/minecraft-server-charts/
```

You can then run `helm search repo itzg` to see the charts.

## Charts

86,agowa338/MinecraftSystemdUnit,,"# MinecraftSystemdUnit
Systemd Unit file for Minecraft Server

## Installation

1. Connect to the server or if you want to run the server on your machine, open a terminal
1. Become root using `su` or `sudo`
    - To validate that you're now root, run `id`
1. Next install the necessary packages 
    ```bash
    apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jre-headless curl screen nano bash grep
    ```
1. Create the `/opt` folder if it doesn't already exist 
    ```bash
    mkdir /opt
    ```
1. Now you need to create the user for the service
    ```bash
    adduser --system --shell /bin/bash --home /opt/minecraft --group minecraft
    chmod +t /opt/minecraft
    ```
1. Create the Systemd Unit file:
    ```bash
    nano /etc/systemd/system/minecraft@.service
    # paste the contents of minecraft@.service
    ```
    or 
    ```bash
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agowa338/MinecraftSystemdUnit/master/minecraft%40.service > /etc/systemd/system/minecraft@.service
    ```

## Setup Instance

Each server has it's own subdirectory of `/opt/minecraft`. This means that when a new server is being added, the following steps need to be followed:

1. Create a subdirectory of `/opt/minecraft` for your Minecraft server, we'll be using `feed-the-beast` as an example
    - It is recommended to use a name which only includes lowercase characters, spaces should be replaced with dashes
    ```bash
    cd /opt/minecraft
    mkdir feed-the-beast
    ```
1. Upload your files to the `/opt/minecraft/feed-the-beast` directory
    - **Note**: All uploaded files should be owned by the `minecraft` user
    ```bash
    chown -R minecraft:minecraft /opt/minecraft/feed-the-beast
    ```
1. Accept the Minecraft server's EULA
    ```bash
    echo 'eula=true' > eula.txt

### RAM allocation

With `minecraft@.service` it's possible to specify the RAM allocation per server. This can be done using a `server.conf` file in the server's directory.

**Example**

```properties
# /opt/minecraft/ftb-beyond/server.conf
MCMINMEM=512M
MCMAXMEM=2048M
```

### Feed the Beast

Some Feed the Beast packs include a `FTBInstall.sh`. This script needs to be executed before starting the server.

```bash
cd /opt/minecraft/ftb-beyond
su -c 'bash /opt/minecraft/ftb-beyond/FTBInstall.sh' minecraft
```

## Usage

### Enable auto-start Minecraft server on boot

```bash
systemctl enable minecraft@ftb-beyond
```

### Disable auto-start Minecraft server on boot

```bash
systemctl disable minecraft@ftb-beyond
```

### Start Minecraft server manually

```bash
systemctl start minecraft@ftb-beyond
```

### Stop Minecraft server manually

```bash
systemctl stop minecraft@ftb-beyond
```

### Connecting to the Minecraft server console

To enter the console, [`screen`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen) is used.

All screen sessions are owned by the `minecraft` user and are prefixed with `mc-`.

```bash
# This will attach to the Minecraft server called `ftb-beyond`
su -c 'screen -r mc-ftb-beyond' minecraft
```

**Note**: To detach (exit) from the session, press <kbd>CTRL + A</kbd> followed by <kbd>D</kbd>.

88,AtomicStryker/atomicstrykers-minecraft-mods,Java,"
This violently short readme applies to 1.17 and newer, and only to mods which have been updated to the respective versions of minecraft.
There is outdated/unmaintained mods in the repository also, be aware.

In the respective mod folder, run ""gradlew build"" and verify it succeeds.
If it does not, the mod might lack the basic setup for the newer MC versions, to be done in gradle.build and by replacing the gradle wrapper to one taken from a matching forge MDK.

run ""gradlew genIntellijRuns"" to get IDEA project files for the project, and starting client and server for testing and debugging.

Use Intellij to open the folder or the gradle.build (Open as project).


In the ideal case all that is required to upgrade to a newer MC version is changing the variables ""mcversion"", ""version"" and ""mappings channel:"" and also updating the ""minecraft"" dependency pointing to a relevant forge version. Forge builds can be found here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/

90,Tominous/minecraft.js-1,JavaScript,"# MinecraftJS

MinecraftJS brings the best-selling PC game ""Minecraft"" into the web with the power of javascript.

# Motivation

Having to open an additional app to play a game is sometimes too tiring. Therefore, we thought it'd be interesting to somehow implement Minecraft with javascript, essentially bringing the whole Minecraft game into the web. This not only takes away the tedious process of installing the game, it also brings the entire game to players with a couple clicks.

# Screenshots

91,mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader,Java,"# minecraft-world-downloader
A Minecraft world downloader that works by intercepting & decrypting network traffic between the client and the server to read & save chunk data. Chunks can be sent back to the client to extend the render distance.


### Downloads  <a href=""https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest""><img align=""right"" src=""https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/total.svg""></a>
Latest Windows release (GUI): [world-downloader.exe](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.exe)

Cross-platform jar (GUI & command-line): [world-downloader.jar](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.jar)

### [Features](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/wiki/Features)
- Requires no client modifications and as such works with every game client, vanilla or not
- Automatically merge into previous downloads or existing worlds
- Save chests and other inventories by opening them
- Extend the client's render distance by sending chunks downloaded previously back to the client
- Overview map of chunks that have been saved:

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/nSM6mLw.png"" width=""50%"" title=""Example of the GUI showing previously downloaded chunks as white squares, chunks sent from the downloader to the client to extend the render distance in normal colours, and chunks sent by server directly to the client in red."">

### Requirements
- Java 17 or higher
- Minecraft version 1.12.2+ // 1.13.2+ // 1.14.1+ // 1.15.2+ // 1.16.2+ // 1.17+ // 1.18+ // 1.19+

### Basic usage
[Download](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.exe) the latest release and run it. Enter the server address in the address field and press start. Instead of connecting to the server itself, connect to `localhost` in Minecraft to start downloading the world.

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/lpjEdPB.png"">

Additional settings can be changed in the other tabs of the settings window.

If you run into any problems, check the [FAQ](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/wiki/FAQ) page for some common issues. 


### Command-line
[Download](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.jar) the cross-platform `world-downloader.jar` and run it using the command-line:

```
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com
```

Then connect to ```localhost``` in Minecraft to start downloading the world. The world will be saved to the ```world/``` by default.

Other arguments can be specified to change the behaviour of the downloader. For example, render distance extending can be enabled by setting the render distance with `-r [distance]`:
```
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com -r 16
```

#### Options
|  **Parameter** | **Default** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  --server | *required* | Server address |
|  --port | 25565 | Server port |
|  --local-port | 25565 | Port on which the downloader will run. |
|  --output | world | World output directory |
|  --no-gui | | Disable the GUI, useful for running in environments that don't support GUIs. |
| --render-distance | 0 | When larger than the server's render distance, send known chunks back to the client |
|  --mark-unsaved-chunks | true | When enabled, marks unsaved chunks red in the GUI. |
|  --minecraft-dir | %appdata%/.minecraft | Path to your Minecraft installation, used for Mojang authentication |
| --username | *none* | Set your Minecraft username, used instead of the Minecraft path for authentication |
| --token | *none* | Set the Minecraft [access token](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/wiki/Authentication), used instead of the Minecraft path for authentication |

Additional options are available by running `java -jar world-downloader.jar --help`.

### Running on Linux
To easily download the latest release using the terminal, the following commands can be used:
```
wget https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.jar
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com
```

When running headless Java, the GUI should be disabled by including the GUI option:
```
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com --no-gui
```

Some linux distributions may require `-Djdk.gtk.version=2` for the GUI to work:
```
java -Djdk.gtk.version=2 -jar world-downloader.jar
```

**This project is no longer actively maintained!**

This project is intended to become a Minecraft Classic clone using HTML 5 technologies, most notably WebGL and WebSockets. No third-party libraries are used, with the exception of glmatrix and socket.io. People who have written similar demos used libraries such as *three.js*, but it is
both foolish and inefficient to use a 3D engine for rendering large amount of blocks.

Screenshots
---------------------

<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/tDzki.png"">![Singleplayer structure](http://i.imgur.com/2qBGy.png)</a>

Structure
---------------------

+ *js/* - Includes the different modules that make up the functionality of WebCraft.
+ *media/* - Contains the graphics resources.
+ *style/* - Contains stylesheets for the HTML front-ends.
+ *singleplayer.html* - The front-end for the singleplayer client.
+ *multiplayer.html* - The front-end for the multiplayer client.
+ *server.js* - The Node.js server code.

Modules
---------------------

The two front-ends invoke the available modules to deliver the components necessary for the gameplay and graphics of either the singleplayer or multiplayer experience. The available modules are listed below.

**Blocks.js**

This is the most *moddable* module, as it contains the structure with the available block materials and their respective properties. It also contains functions invoked by the render class for proper shading and lighting of blocks.

**World.js**

This is the base class, which all other modules depend on. Although it is a very important module, it is also the most passive module. It contains the block structure of the world and exposes functions for manipulating it.

**Physics.js**

This module has strong roots in the world class and simulates the flow of fluid blocks and the gravity of falling blocks at regular intervals. It has no specific parameters and is simply invoked in the game loop to update the world.

**Render.js**

This is the module that takes care of visualizing the block structure in the world class. When a world is assigned to it, it sets up a structure of chunks that are updated when a block changes. These chunks are mostly just fancy Vertex Buffer Objects. As this module takes care of the rendering, it also houses the code that deals with *picking* (getting a block from an x, y position on the screen).

**Player.js**

Finally there is also the module that handles everything related to the player of the game. Surprising, perhaps, is that it also deals with the physics and collision of the player. Less surprising is that it manages the material selector and input and responds to it in an update function, just like the physics module.

**Network.js**

This module makes it easy to synchronize a world between a server and connected clients. It comes with both a *Client* and *Server* class to facilitate all of your networking needs.

Typical game set-up
---------------------

First a new world is created and the block structure is initialised.

	var world = new World( 16, 16, 16 );
	world.createFlatWorld( 6 );

The *6* in *createFlatWorld* here is the line between the ground and the first air layer.

Now that we have a world, we can set up a renderer, which will subsequently divide the world into chunks for rendering.

	var render = new Renderer( ""renderSurface"" );
	render.setWorld( world, 8 );
	render.setPerspective( 60, 0.01, 200 );

The *8* here determines the XYZ size of one chunk. In this case the entire world consists out of 8 chunks.

To finish the code that deals with world management, we create the physics simulator.

	var physics = new Physics();
	physics.setWorld( world );

And finally, we add a local player to the game:

	var player = new Player();
	player.setWorld( world );
	player.setInputCanvas( ""renderSurface"" );
	player.setMaterialSelector( ""materialSelector"" );

That concludes the set-up code. The render loop can be constructed with a timer on a fixed framerate:

	setInterval( function()
	{
		var time = new Date().getTime() / 1000.0;
		
		// Simulate physics
		physics.simulate();
		
		// Update local player
		player.update();
		
		// Build a chunk
		render.buildChunks( 5 );
		
		// Draw world
		render.setCamera( player.getEyePos().toArray(), player.angles );
		render.draw();
		
		while ( new Date().getTime() / 1000 - time < 0.016 );
	}, 1 );

To see how the material selector and canvas can be set-up, have a look at *singleplayer.html* and *style/main.css*. Note that the player and physics modules are entirely optional, so you could just as well use this code as a base for making a Minecraft map viewer on your website.

93,PEXPlugins/PermissionsEx,Java,"# README

## PermissionsEx

PermissionsEx \(PEX \(not the pipe\)\) is a full-service permissions plugin giving in-depth control of permissions for a server. PEX is available for various server and proxy platforms:

* [Bukkit/Spigot/Paper](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/permissionsex) -- [source](platform/bukkit/)
* Sponge -- [source (API 8)](platform/sponge/) / [source (API 7)](platform/sponge7/)
* BungeeCord/Waterfall -- [source](platform/bungee/)
* Velocity -- [source](platform/velocity/)
* Fabric -- [source](platform/fabric/)

💬 Having an issue setting up PEX? Check out our [Discord](https://discord.gg/PHpuzZS)

🐞 Found a bug? File a [bug report](https://github.com/PEXPlugins/PermissionsEx/issues)

⛏ [Development Builds](https://jenkins.addstar.com.au/job/PermissionsEx/lastSuccessfulBuild/)

## Development

Want to access permissions in your plugin? PermissionsEx tries to provide extensive compatibility with native APIs, but sometimes more direct access is needed. In that case, PEX has an extensive API that allows querying any sort of information.

PEX can also be extended to support new platforms or implement new data store formats using just the implementation-agnostic `core` API.

### On Maven

PEX is available in a format that can be retrieved in Maven. Its repository:

```markup
<repository>
    <id>pex-repo</id>
    <url>https://repo.glaremasters.me/repository/permissionsex/</url>
</repository>
```

and its dependency specification is:

```markup
<dependency>
    <groupId>ca.stellardrift.permissionsex</groupId>
    <artifactId>permissionsex-core</artifactId> <!-- replace with -sponge or -bukkit depending on which platform you're using -->
    <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### On Gradle

We work in the Kotlin DSL, but Groovy should be similar.

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven(url = ""https://repo.glaremasters.me/repository/permissionsex/"") {
        name = ""pex-repo""
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation(""ca.stellardrift.permissionsex:permissionsex-core:2.0-SNAPSHOT"")
}
```

## Contributing

PermissionsEx always appreciates well thought-out pull requests for code changes, documentation improvements, and translations. All contributions except those to the Bukkit implementation of PEX must be released under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license. All contributions to PermissionsEx for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper must be provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

We build with Gradle -- a wrapper is provided, to build the project simply run `./gradlew build`. Feel free to run ideas by me in the discord before spending time implementing something that doesn't match my vision for the plugin.

97,feather-rs/feather,Rust,"# Feather
[![build](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/actions)
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/619316022800809995?logo=discord)](https://discordapp.com/invite/4eYmK69)

A Minecraft server implementation written in Rust.

### Status

The project is in an **early stage**. Many, many features are unimplemented. We welcome help from anyone willing to contribute!

### Supported Minecraft versions

Feather supports 1.16.5 clients and world saves. We do not currently have plans to support multiple versions at once, but
we may consider this in the future.

### Goals

The Feather project aims to provide a Minecraft server that is _fast_, _modular_, and paired with an ergonomic plugin API.

Our mid-term goal is to make Feather usable on hub and minigame servers. The limited set of gameplay features available in Feather
is not a problem for such servers that require a small subset of vanilla functionality. On the other hand, Feather's modularity
and performance lends itself to these types of servers. Therefore, our current focus is
on building a rich plugin API to enable these use cases.

In the long term, Feather could be used on larger, more survival-like servers, where its performance should allow many players to simultaneously play on the same world requiring very few resources.

### Ecosystem

The Feather ecosystem consists of several repositories:
* [`libcraft`](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/tree/main/libcraft), a set of Rust crates providing Minecraft functionality.
* [`quill`](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/tree/main/quill), our work-in-progress plugin API. Quill plugins are written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. Feather runs them in a sandboxed WebAssembly VM.
* `feather`, the server software built on top of `libcraft` and `quill`.

### Performance

Comparisons to vanilla performance _will_ be extremely misleading, because Feather implements so few features. But if you really want them:

* Feather can handle 1,000,000 entities spawned by a plugin before it starts to max out the CPU. The vanilla server will croak long before then.
* Feather can handle 500 concurrent player connections with each player walking in a random direction.

These results _will_ change after more features are implemented in Feather, so take them with a grain of salt.

Memory usage in Feather is proportional to the number of loaded chunks, not player counts. In the 500 player test, the server uses ~40 MiB of RAM
until the players start to spread out. In the 1,000,000 entities test, it uses 400 MiB of RAM without any chunks loaded.

### Running
We offer precompiled binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/actions/workflows/main.yml).
NB: Do **NOT** use github releases, they are majorly outdated

To run Feather:
* Extract the downloaded archive.
* Run the binary.
  * On Linux and macOS: `./feather-server` in the server directory
  * On Windows: double-click `feather-server.exe`
  
The server will create a configuration file (`config.toml`) which you can modify.

Feather will generate a world by default. If you want to load a vanilla world,
copy the world save to the server directory under the name ""world"" (by default).

Warning: Feather world persistence is fairly new and will likely cause problems
when attempting to open Feather worlds in vanilla. Do not let Feather touch worlds
you care about unless they have been backed up.

### Compiling
If you are on another platform, compile the server yourself to try it out:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/feather-rs/feather
cd feather
cargo build --release
```

Compiling from source requires the latest stable version of Rust. Older Rust versions may be able
to compile Feather, but they are not guaranteed to keep working.

The server executable will be located in `target/release`.

### Architecture

For contributors, we have a work-in-progress explanation of Feather's architecture [here](docs/architecture.md).

### FAQ

* Is Feather production ready?

Not yet. There are numerous bugs and missing features which have yet to be resolved,
and the codebase has not been tested enough to consider the server production ready.

* How can I contribute?

Check out our [issue tracker](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/issues) to find out what needs to be worked on. Feel free
to join [our Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/4eYmK69) and ask questions whenever you need. Thanks for your interest in contributing!

* Are there other ways I can help?

Yes! We're always looking for people to test out the server and find bugs. If you find anything that doesn't
seem right to you, please submit an issue on the issue tracker.

I'm LlmDl, the third lead developer of Towny. I have been managing the Towny project since 2014 and the release of Minecraft 1.8. Prior to me there was the original creator: Shadeness (active 2010-2011,) and the second developer: ElgarL (active 2011-2014.)

I am helped out by the TownyAdvanced team: Articdive, FlagCourier, Warrior and a few other private members. Being open-source Towny has a large list of [Contributors](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/graphs/contributors) who have helped improve the code base over the years as well.

Towny is one of the oldest still-in-development plugins for Minecraft. Shadeness created Towny for the now-defunct server platform called hMod. Shadeness ported Towny to Bukkit and left the project shortly afterwards, returning later to add EnemyWar or as it became known: [FlagWar](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar). Towny is now over 10 years old! 

**Go check out some of the [features](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki#features) Towny has and see why it's still popular for yourself.**

### Importing Towny for API use
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/TownyAdvanced/Towny.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#TownyAdvanced/Towny)

Developers who wish to use the Towny API in their plugins may read [the following instructions on adding Towny via a Maven pom.xml.](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/TownyAPI#getting-started-with-towny-and-your-ide)

___

### Building Towny
If you would like to build from a specific branch yourself, you can do so with either [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) or [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), depending on the age of the branch.

For building, open your terminal / command prompt and navigate to the Towny Directory (either extracted, or cloned).

- **Maven**

    - Run `mvn clean package` to generate the plugin in the `target` directory, within the Towny folder. 


- **Ant** (_Deprecated_)

    - For older branches using the Ant build system, the main command to use would be: `ant clean jar`. This command will _exit_ the Towny directory, creating a lib folder alongside it. A Towny.jar file will be generated and placed within there.
    - _Note: As Ant is being deprecated, older branches may eventually not be able to be built against without modification of the `build.xml` file. We leave no guarantee that the file repo providing the dependencies will stay up._

=============

One of the best disguise plugins available, this plugin offers an astounding amount of features due to the unique way it implements its use of disguises!

The commonly accepted method of disguising is turning a pig into a cow, but this takes it a step further and allows you to turn that pig, into a dropped piece of diamond armor!

You can modify each disguise to your own liking through use of the API or commands with full tab completion support and the best part is; All of this is free!

There are a few features which you need to pay for, but none of it is needed to enjoy the plugin to its fullest! For further details, read the plugin's description on SpigotMC. You are required to sign in, but you do not need to purchase the plugin.

NOTE: These versions will NOT work with older versions of Minecraft. There is no support for older versions of this plugin.

When posting an issue:<br>
Please make sure you<br>
1) Post a stack trace error, if no stack trace, then post the odd behavior<br>
2) Post the exact steps you used in order to reproduce the issue.<br>

## Introduction

CraftTweaker is a Minecraft mod which allows modpacks and servers to customize the game. With CraftTweaker you can change recipes, script events, add new commands and even change item properties! When used with other mods the possibilities become endless! Ranging from custom machine recipes to entirely new blocks and items!

## Feedback

If you're looking for help with the mod, or just want to come hang out, we have a [Discord server](https://discord.blamejared.com).  
If you're running into a bug or have a feature request, please don't be afraid to make an [issue on the tracker](https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker/issues).

## License

Distributed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker/blob/1.19/LICENSE) file for more information.

## Setup

To set up the CraftTweaker development environment you must clone the repo and initialize the submodule.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker.git
```

After the project has been cloned and initialized you can directly import it into your IDE of choice.

## Build

Building the project is as easy as running a Gradle command!
Simply run:
```bash
gradlew build
```
and the outputted `.jar` files will be put in `build/libs/` folder of each subproject (`Common/build/libs/`, `Fabric/build/libs/` and `Forge/build/libs/`).

CraftTweaker also has automated markdown documentation, the output of that will be in the `docsOut/` folder.

## Maven

Every push to this repository is built and published to the [BlameJared](https://maven.blamejared.com) maven, to use these builds in your project, first add the BlameJared maven to your `repositories` block in your build.gradle file like so:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { 
        url = 'https://maven.blamejared.com'
        name = 'BlameJared Maven'
    }
}
```

Then, depending on what modloader you are using, you can use the following snippets, just replace `[VERSION]` with the latest version for each artifact.

### Fabric [![Maven](https://img.shields.io/maven-metadata/v?color=C71A36&label=Latest%20version&logo=Latest%20version&metadataUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmaven.blamejared.com%2Fcom%2Fblamejared%2Fcrafttweaker%2FCraftTweaker-fabric-1.19.2%2Fmaven-metadata.xml&style=flat-square)](https://maven.blamejared.com/com/blamejared/crafttweaker/CraftTweaker-fabric-1.19.2/)

```groovy
dependencies {
    modCompileOnly('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-fabric-1.19.2:[VERSION]')
    // Example:
    // modCompileOnly('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-fabric-1.19.2:10.0.1')
}
```

### Forge [![Maven](https://img.shields.io/maven-metadata/v?color=C71A36&label=Latest%20version&logo=Latest%20version&metadataUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmaven.blamejared.com%2Fcom%2Fblamejared%2Fcrafttweaker%2FCraftTweaker-forge-1.19.2%2Fmaven-metadata.xml&style=flat-square)](https://maven.blamejared.com/com/blamejared/crafttweaker/CraftTweaker-forge-1.19.2/)


```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly(fg.deobf('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-forge-1.19.2:[VERSION]'))
    // Example:
    // compileOnly(fg.deobf('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-forge-1.19.2:10.0.1'))
}
```

### Common [![Maven](https://img.shields.io/maven-metadata/v?color=C71A36&label=Latest%20version&logo=Latest%20version&metadataUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmaven.blamejared.com%2Fcom%2Fblamejared%2Fcrafttweaker%2FCraftTweaker-common-1.19.2%2Fmaven-metadata.xml&style=flat-square)](https://maven.blamejared.com/com/blamejared/crafttweaker/CraftTweaker-common-1.19.2/)

If you are in a multi-modloader environment (Such as [MultiLoader](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template)), you can bring the Common artifact (code that does not depend on any specific mod loader but rather just the vanilla game) into your Common project like so:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-common-1.19.2:[VERSION]')
    // Example:
    // compileOnly('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-common-1.19.2:10.0.1')
}
```

# Guide

## How To Play In Unity?

1. 打开 SinglePlayer 场景
2. 点击播放按钮
3. 根据屏幕上的键位提示进行游戏

## Asset Management

在编辑器下支持两种资源加载模式：

* 从 `AssetDatabase` 加载（适合开发时使用，不需要构建 `AssetBundle`，对资源的修改立即生效）

* 从 `AssetBundle` 文件中加载（适合测试时使用，需要构建 `AssetBundle`）

两种模式只需要在 Unity 菜单栏 `Minecraft-Unity/Assets/Load Mode` 中切换即可，它们共享同一套 API，上层逻辑不需要在意。

代码示例：

```c#
// 首先，确保场景中有挂载 AssetManagerUpdater 组件，并设置了相关属性，或者自己已经手动初始化了 AssetManager.
using Minecraft.Assets; // 全在这个命名空间里.

class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    // 直接保存资源的路径，如：Assets/MyFolder/MyAsset.asset.
    public string AssetPath;

    // 保存资源的“地址”（推荐）.
    // 在 Inspector 中，这个字段和普通的 Object 引用没有任何区别.
    // 内部保存了资源的 GUID，也就是说即使资源位置被移动、名称被修改，引用仍然不会丢失！
    public AssetPtr Asset;

    private IEnumerator Start()
    {
        // 全异步架构.
        // 不需要关心资源具体在哪个 AssetBundle 中.
        AsyncAsset asset = AssetManager.Instance.LoadAsset<GameObject>(Asset); // 也可以用 AssetPath.
        yield return asset; // 等待资源加载完成.

        GameObject go = asset.GetAssetAs<GameObject>(); // 获取具体的对象.

        // do something.

        AssetManager.Instance.Unload(asset); // 卸载资源.（这里也可以用资源的名称来卸载）
    }
}
```

上面的示例只是最基本的使用，更多 API 就请看源码吧（毕竟这个不是重点）。

构建 `AssetBundle`：在 Unity 菜单栏中点击 `Minecraft-Unity/Assets/Build AssetBundles` 就行了，会自动打包为当前发布平台的资源包，然后放到指定路径。



## Configuration

方块数据、物品数据（暂时还没用）、生物群系数据都在一个自定义的编辑器中进行配置。

在 Unity 菜单栏中点击 `Minecraft-Unity/MC Config Editor` 即可打开，界面如下图：



![编辑器-方块](EditorRecordings/mc_config_editor_block.png)



![编辑器-物品](EditorRecordings/mc_config_editor_item.png)



![编辑器-生物群系](EditorRecordings/mc_config_editor_biome.png)



### Tips

1. 工具栏左边的下拉菜单可以切换当前编辑的数据（Blocks / Items / Biomes）
2. 点击工具栏上的 加号 或者 减号 可以 添加 或者 删除 一个数据项（Block / Item）
3. 工具栏右侧从左往右分别是：搜索框、保存按钮、设置按钮
4. 点击设置按钮可以修改配置文件的保存路径，在一开始用的时候记得先把保存路径设置好
5. 我做好的配置文件都保存在：`Assets/Minecraft Default PBR Resources/Tables/Configs`
6. 如果你不想另起炉灶的话，在刚打开这个编辑器后就把路径设置为第5条中的路径
7. 保存的配置文件有一大坨，其中文件名前加了 `[editor]` 的都是只在 Unity Editor 下使用的
8. 如果想知道第7条中提到的文件有啥作用的话，请看源码吧，这里空间太小，我写不下（费马行为）
9. 如果还有啥问题就提个 issue 问我吧，我想不出来了



## Lua Codes

Lua 代码我都放在了 `Assets/Minecraft Default PBR Resources/Lua Scripts` 路径下。其中 `main.lua` 作为 Lua 代码的 Entry Point，`cleanup.lua` 用来释放资源。如果想修改这些设置，可以在 Hierarchy 中找到 `Lua Manager` 来修改。

`Minecraft.Lua` 命名空间下提供了 `ILuaCallCSharp`、`ICSharpCallLua`、`IHotfixable` 这些空接口，相信熟悉 xlua 的人马上可以看懂。举个栗子，实现 `ILuaCallCSharp` 这个接口，等于给类打上了 `XLua.LuaCallCSharpAttribute`。



### Write Custom Block Behaviours

首先，创建一个 Lua 文件，然后设置好它的 AssetBundleName。

然后，这里先以沙子为例：

```lua
require ""block"" -- 引入这个模块，这里定义了方块行为的 API
local gravity = require ""blocks.templates.gravity"" -- 引入我提供的一个行为模板，这里用的是重力的模板
sand = create_block_behaviour(gravity) -- 直接继承，完成
-- 注意：sand 这个变量一定要是 global 变量，而且名字要和之前在编辑器配置的名称一致
```

写完以后，别忘记在 `main.lua` 里 `require` 一下。最后再提一下 `block` 这个模块，先看下简短的源码：

```lua
-- 文件路径：Assets/Minecraft Default PBR Resources/Lua Scripts/block.lua

local behaviour = {} -- 默认行为

-- 方块行为被注册时调用
function behaviour:init(world, block)
    self.world = world
    self.__block = block
    print(""init block behaviour: "" .. block.InternalName)
end

-- 边上的方块刷新时调用
function behaviour:tick(x, y, z)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块被放置后调用
function behaviour:place(x, y, z)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块被破坏后调用
function behaviour:destroy(x, y, z)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块被点击后调用
function behaviour:click(x, y, z)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块实体初始化时调用
-- entity 参数就是方块实体对象
-- context 参数就是一个 LuaTable，可以用来保存一些临时数据（切勿直接 self.xxx = xxx）
-- 下同
function behaviour:entity_init(entity, context)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块实体被销毁时调用
function behaviour:entity_destroy(entity, context) 
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块实体的 Update 方法
function behaviour:entity_update(entity, context)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块实体的 FixedUpdate 方法
function behaviour:entity_fixed_update(entity, context)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块实体被碰撞时调用
-- flags 参数就是 UnityEngine.CollisionFlags
function behaviour:entity_on_collisions(entity, flags, context)
    -- default implement
end

-- 获取该行为对应的 BlockData 对象
function behaviour:get_block_data()
    return self.__block
end

--- 创建一个方块行为对象。
---
--- 如果不传入 `base` 参数，返回的对象将具有默认行为。
---
--- 如果传入 `base` 参数，返回的对象将会继承 `base` 的所有行为。
---
--- @param base? table
--- @return table
function create_block_behaviour(base)
    return setmetatable({
        base = base or behaviour
    }, {
        __index = function(table, key)
            local block = rawget(table, ""__block"")
            return block and block[key] or rawget(table, ""base"")[key]
        end
    })
end
```

这个模块允许我们像定义一个类一样去定义方块行为，非常方便。另外，我提供了 `blocks.templates.gravity` 和 `blocks.templates.fluid` 两种模板，用于快速实现重力和流体的行为。如果要实现更复杂的行为，就要自己写代码了。



## Terrain Generation

在 `Assets/Minecraft Default PBR Resources/WorldGen` 路径下保存了许多地形生成相关的配置文件，可以自己修改参数、增加生成器来改变地形。

如果还有问题就提一个 issue 吧，我看到后会回复的。

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/funnyitselmo/minecraftserverstatus/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/funnyitselmo/minecraftserverstatus) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/funnyitselmo/minecraftserverstatus/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/funnyitselmo/minecraftserverstatus) [![Latest Unstable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/funnyitselmo/minecraftserverstatus/v/unstable)](https://packagist.org/packages/funnyitselmo/minecraftserverstatus) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/funnyitselmo/minecraftserverstatus/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/funnyitselmo/minecraftserverstatus)

Minecraft Server Status Query, written in PHP, with online players, motd, favicon and more server related informations without plugins and enable-query.

*Tested with Spigot 1.9 and Bungeecord 1.9 & 1.8*

### Installation
```
composer require funnyitselmo/minecraftserverstatus
```
### Tutorial
```Java
use MinecraftServerStatus\MinecraftServerStatus;

require '../vendor/autoload.php';

$response = MinecraftServerStatus::query('lostforce.com', 25565);

if (! $response) {
    echo ""The Server is offline!"";
} else {
    echo ""<img width=\""64\"" height=\""64\"" src=\"""" . $response['favicon'] . ""\"" /> <br>
		The Server "" . $response['hostname'] . "" is running on "" . $response['version'] . "" and is online,
		currently are "" . $response['players'] . "" players online
		of a maximum of "" . $response['max_players'] . "". The motd of the server is '"" . $response['description'] . ""'.
		The server has a ping of "" . $response['ping'] . "" milliseconds."";
}
```
If the server is offline MinecraftServerStatus::query returns false else it returns an array which contains the server informations.

### Variables
The following table contains the available variables the response can contain. The default value of each variable is false.

<table border=""0"">
<tr>
<th>Array Index</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>'hostname'</pre></td>
<td>Exact server address in 127.0.0.1 format</td>

## Forking/Redistributing/Custom builds policy

We don't care what you do with your fork/custom build as long as you follow the terms of the [license](LICENSE) (this is a legal responsibility), and if you made code changes rather than just packaging a custom build, please do the following as a basic courtesy:

- Make it clear that your fork is not PrismLauncher and is not endorsed by or affiliated with the PrismLauncher project (<https://prismlauncher.org>).
- Go through [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) and change PrismLauncher's API keys to your own or set them to empty strings (`""""`) to disable them (this way the program will still compile but the functionality requiring those keys will be disabled).

If you have any questions or want any clarification on the above conditions please make an issue and ask us.

Be aware that if you build this software without removing the provided API keys in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) you are accepting the following terms and conditions:

For cracked account, just type the username in `Email` field

## Tips

There are environment variable to override the default value of host, port, username and password
- `MC_BOT_HOST` for the host (String)
- `MC_BOT_PORT` for the port (Integer)
- `MC_BOT_USERNAME` for the email/username (String)
- `MC_BOT_PREMIUM` to specify if the Microsoft Authentication should be used (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_DEBUG` for the debug mode (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_PREFIX` for the prefix of the commands (default=`.`) (String)
- `MC_BOT_AUTO_RECONNECT` for the auto reconnect mode (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_RECONNECT_DELAY` for the delay before reconnect (Integer)
- `MC_BOT_LANG_FILE` for the language file (default=en_us.json) (String) (File must be in the lang directory at the same level as the jar file)
- `MC_BOT_COMMAND` for the command to execute when the bot is connected (String) (Example: `/say Hello World!`)
- `MC_BOT_COMMAND_DELAY` for the delay before executing the command (default=750ms) (Integer)

They are some builtin commands in the bot

- `difficulty` get the difficulty of the server
- `food` get the food level of the player
- `help` get all the available commands, their description and their usage
- `health` get the health of the player
- `list` get the players connected (Sometimes the packet is glitched, you can use the status button go get the players)
- `pos` get the player position
- `disconnect` disconnect the bot

## Command Line Interface

<p> Like the GUI, the CLI can use commands and send message to the server </p>
<p> Simply type anything in the CLI and type enter</p>

```
 -a,--autoReconnect          Activate auto reconnect
    --cmd <arg>              Set the command that will be executed when
                             the bot is connected
    --cmdDelay <arg>         Set the delay between command execution
                             (Default=750ms)

 -h,--host <arg>             Setup the host value (Default=127.0.0.1)
    --help                   Show this help page
    --langFile <arg>         Set the translation language for Minecraft
                             Message (Default=en_us.json) (Should be the
                             filename, placed in lang directory at the
                             same level as the jar)
 -p,--port <arg>             Setup the port value (Default=25565)
    --premium                If the user need to be logged through
                             Microsoft Authentication
    --reconnectDelay <arg>   Delay before reconnection
 -s,--status                 Display only the status of the server

# Minecraft Server
**Starter project enabling you a Minecraft Server using just a Raspberry Pi 4 or Jetson Nano.**

This project has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 B 4GB & Nvidia Jetson Nano. I do not recommend using a Raspberry Pi 3 or older. They do not have enough RAM and power to calculate all the things. :boom:

## Why balenaMinecraftServer?

* It works out of the box, just start it, and it just works. :+1:
* You can play anywhere. You can take the Pi to a friend, connect to his Wi-Fi and enjoy playing. :video_game:
* It is free. No costs, no big server and no complication. :free:
* Why host on a computer? A Pi is power efficient! :rocket:
* You can easy maintain the files on the Pi by using your PC. :computer:

## Hardware required

* Raspberry Pi 4B (We recommend the 4GB or the 8GB model. 1GB is not enough!) or Nvidia Jetson Nano
* A fan or cooling system to prevent lag caused by throttling
* A 16GB or greater micro SD Card (We always recommend SanDisk Extreme Pro SD cards)
* Power supply

## Software required

* A download of this project (of course)
* Software to flash an SD card ([balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher))
* A free [balenaCloud](https://balena.io/cloud) account
* The [balena CLI tools](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

## Setup and use :stars:

To run this project is as simple as deploying it to a balenaCloud application; no additional configuration is required.

### Setup the device :cd:

* Sign up for or login to the [balenaCloud dashboard](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com)
* Create an application, selecting the correct device type for your Raspberry Pi
* Add a device to the application, enabling you to download the OS
* Flash the downloaded OS to your SD card with [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher)
* Power up the board and check it's online in the dashboard

### One Click Deployment

You can deploy this server with one click with the button below. Or, you can follow the manual deployment instructions in the next section.

[![](https://balena.io/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/balena-minecraft-server)

### Manually Deploy this application :airplane:

* Install the [balena CLI tools](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
* Login with `balena login`
* Download this project and from the project directory run `balena push <appName>` where `<appName>` is the name you gave your balenaCloud application in the first step.

## Connect to the server :satellite:

Balena Minecraft Server sets automatically your Server hostname to `balenaminecraftserver.local`. It is the address the from your server. You can connect to it like this:

**Note:** The IP address also works.

![Server-IP](images/Server-IP.png)

Now you have a balenaServer :sunglasses::

**NOTE:** This works only in the connected Wifi. If you want to play worldwide click here: https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/balena-server/blob/master/README.md#play-worldwide-optional-earth_americas

![Minecraft Screenshot](images/minecraft-screenshot.png)

## Connect to the terminal :satellite:

The server has no console input option in the cloud dashboard, so you need `RCON`. The port is `25575` and the password is `balena`. It is a protocol for connecting to the server.
There are many clients, but you can pick one here:

* mcrcon: https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon/releases (NOTE: You will need for starting this script this batch file if you are using windows (Just paste it in the unzipped directory.): https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/RCON-Script/blob/master/launch.bat)

* Minecraft Server RCON: https://alexprogrammerde.github.io/Minecraft-Server-RCON.rar

## Connect to the file-directory :satellite:

You can connect to the server and change your serverfiles. I recommend using a tool like [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) or if you are using OSX or a linux distribution you can use [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).  The IP Address to connect to is “balenaminecraftserver” (without the quotes), the protocol to choose is SCP (If you got the choice), the port number is 22, the username is “root” (again, without the quotes) and the password is “balena” (no quotes). The files are in the folder named “serverfiles” at the root directory, you can double click to open that directory and browse the files in there.

**NOTE:** You can also change your SCP password by setting the `SCP_PASSWORD` Environment Variable within balenaCloud.  On the left, simply click on “Device Variables” and then click the “Add Variable” button. Give it a name of `SCP_PASSWORD`, and set the value to your password. 

## Connect to another Wifi :satellite:

balenaMinecraftServer has wifi-connect integrated. You can use it for taking the Pi everywhere. If you want to read more is here the link to the programm: https://github.com/balena-io/wifi-connect (There is explained how it works.) 

## Change hostname
You can change the hostname by defining the DEVICE_HOSTNAME Environment Variable within balenaCloud.

**NOTE:** If you decide to change the hostname, you will have to use your new hostname within Minecraft to connect to the server, instead of `balenaminecraftserver.local`.

## Custom RAM (optional) :link:

Devices like the Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB or the 8GB model have enough RAM to run the server with more RAM (the default value used by balena Minecraft server is 1GB). If you set `RAM` to a value like `2G`, `4G`, or `6G` it will have the specified amount of RAM available.

## Add plugins (optional) :wrench:

balenaMinecraftServer also supports plugins. Just drop the in the plugins folder using [`SCP`](https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/balena-minecraft-server#connect-to-the-file-directory-satellite). The current Minecraft version is `1.16`. You can get your plugins from there(Other work too.): 

* Spigot resources: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/categories/spigot.4/
* Bukkit: https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins

**NOTE:** Before adding the plugin and getting an error look if the plugin supports `1.16`.

## Play worldwide (optional) :earth_americas:

Once you’ve perfected the setup of your server on your local network, you might be interested in unveiling your server to the rest of the world! Here’s how you can enable remote access and allow players to connect via the Internet.

![NO-IP Picture](images/NO-IP.png)

If you’d like to allow friends outside your local network to join your server, you’ll need to set up dynamic DNS (DDNS) to expose your Pi to the outside world. This example uses a service called No-IP, which has a free tier for people who want to try DDNS out, though other options and methods do exist as well. In the case of this example, you will need to: 

* Create an account with [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/sign-up) by visiting their website.
* After creating the account and logging in, create a Hostname (example: balena.serverminecraft.net) by [following their documentation](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/getting-started-with-no-ip-com/).
* Set up Port Forwarding: You will need to route your Minecraft traffic to port 25565 on your Pi. To do this, you will log in to your home router and setup Port Forwarding. This step varies by particular brand of modem or router, but the No-IP documentation does a good job of describing the process [here](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/). You may need to follow instructions specific to your modem or router if the No-IP documentation does not contain your particular type.
* Optional: You can log in to No-IP with your router to keep the IP Address current in case it changes. That allows the router to connect automatically to No-IP. Here is a [guide by No-IP](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/how-to-configure-ddns-in-router/) on how to accomplish this.
* Paste your public / external internet address in the box labeled IP Address into the No-IP dashboard. You're done. 👍

For a deeper look at setting up remote access, please [reference this guide](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/getting-started-with-no-ip-com/) (Note: You can skip the DUC part).

## Custom Server (optional) :eyeglasses:

If you want to customize your server even further, but don't know where to start, take a look at some server software listed here:

* Spigot (Vanilla Java Edition): https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot
* Purpur (Vanilla Java Edition, very well optimized for 1.16.3) https://purpur.pl3x.net/
* Vanilla from Minecraft (Vanilla Java Edition): https://getbukkit.org/download/vanilla
* Paper (Vanilla Java Edition): https://papermc.io/downloads
* Forge (Modded Java Edition): http://files.minecraftforge.net/
* ccSpigot (Vanilla Java Edition, Fork and continuation of Paper 1.12.2): https://github.com/moom0o/ccSpigot

Note: Balena Minecraft Server uses Paper. It is an efficient and powerful server. It is compatible with spigot and bukkit plugins.

If you want to use a different Minecraft Sever .jar, add a variable called `JAR_FILE`. The value should be the same as your custom .jar file that you placed in the serverfiles directory using SCP.

I encourage you to take your server build even further! There are many tutorials out there on server customization-- this article only touches on a few ideas. If you need help, please reach out by submitting an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/balena-minecraft-server/issues).

This project is in active development so if you have any feature requests or issues please submit them here on GitHub. PRs are welcome, too. :octocat:

Here is a little server demo :crown::

110,MattiBorchers/MinecraftEarthMap,JavaScript,"# Minecraft Earth Map
WorldPainter script and heightmaps for generating an Earth map for Minecraft.

Just run the script ""world.js"" from ""tools"" -> ""Run Script..."" in WorldPainter.
Be sure to change the ""path"" variable to match your folder with the script and files. Be sure to place all images, layers and terrain in the right folders.

The script was tested on an Intel i5-6500 with 32 GB of RAM.

Time / RAM needed to execute the script for 1.12:

1:4000 = 3 min / 2.1 GB RAM

1:2000 = 14 min / 5.7 GB RAM

1:1000 = 62 min / 19.1 GB RAM

## Images
The base of the script are the various images linked above. To determine the right resolution, I referred to Minecraft's region files, which have a size of 512x512 blocks. The final map should be a multiple of 512. The next step in my process was to edit the existing images. For example, the ""Köppen Climate Classification"" image had an original resolution of 43200x21600 pixels. The nearest fit for the map is 43008x21504, so I changed the canvas size (I didn't want to resize the image, otherwise information would be lost. Anti-aliasing is also forbidden since the script assigns a biome to a specific RGB color.)

The same step was made for the Globcover, except the original resolution was 129600x55800, which is not the 2:1 format. That's because Antarctica isn't pictured in this image. At first, I changed the canvas size to 129600x64800 (added the new pixels at the bottom of the existing image), then resized the image to 43200x21600 pixels (this is exact 1/3) without resampling (again, we don't want anti-aliasing) and then changed the canvas again to match 43008x21504.

For the heightmaps, I combined the surface elevation and the bathymetry images from NASA, which had a resolutions of 21600x10800. At first, I resized the images to 43200x21600, this time with resampling (Bicubic interpolation), so we get smoother mountains. Later, I also used a blur effect for more realistic elevation in Minecraft.

A lot of the images from ""shadedrelief.com"" had to be resized from 16200x8100 pixels and be applied a posterize effect afterwards, because layers are only applied or not applied. 1 or 0, black or white.

For the street data I used QGIS3 to export the images.

In summary, each image has an original resolution of 43200x21600 and is then cut to 43008x21504 (even on all sides).

Source: https://github.com/Morlok8k/MinecraftLandGenerator

-----------------------------------------------

This program lets you generate an area of land with your Minecraft SMP server (and is prossibly future-proof for newer versions). You set up your java command line and minecraft server paths in the MinecraftLandGenerator.conf file, set up the server's server.properties file with the name of the world you wish to use, and then run this program.
When a Minecraft server is launched, it automatically generates chunks within a square area of 25x25 chunks (400x400 blocks), centered on the current spawn point (formally 20x20 chunks, 320x320 blocks). When provided X and Z ranges as arguments, this program will launch the server repeatedly, editing the level.dat file between sessions, to generate large amounts of land without players having to explore them. The generated land will have about the X and Z ranges as requested by the arguments, though it will not be exact due to the spawn point typically not on the border of a chunk. (Because of this, MLG by default adds a slight overlap with each pass - 380x380 blocks) You can use the -x and -z switches to override the spawn offset and center the land generation on a different point.
The program makes a backup of level.dat as level_backup.dat before editing, and restores the backup at the end. In the event that a level_backup.dat file already exists, the program will refuse to proceed, leaving the user to determine why the level_backup.dat file exists and whether they would rather restore it or delete it, which must be done manually.

This program is free, and the source code is included in the .jar file.  (If accidently missing, like in 1.3.0 and 1.4.0, it is always available at Github.)

1.6.2
- Major Code Optimization
- Updated Time Output again.  Now says ""1 Minute"" instead of ""1 Minutes"".
- Updated Location Code - the center of the square is now truely centered, and it trys to get as close to the given size as possible.
- Added ""-nowait"" and its shorter version ""-n""
- Added currently non-functional RCON code.  Will try to make functional in the future.

1.6.11
- Removed End-of-Generation ASCII-Graphic - It didn't really fit with MLG.
- Updated Time Output.
- Changed estimated time remaining to count all runs, not just the last four.
- Added the time it took to complete at the end of generation.

1.6.1
- Added some modifications for scripting  (Mainly for a new Initial setup script)
- Changed MLG's Y to Z.  Now it matches Minecraft.  Y in the game is Height.
- Renamed -y switch to -z.  MLG will remain backwards compatible if you use the old -y switch.
- Updated -printspawn to show X,Y,Z
- Added End-of-Generation ASCII-Graphic
- Slightly altered some text output

- Minor fixes/edits/typos
- Added link to new MLG website to readme file
1.6.03
- added decoding of escape characters of URL's (so a space is a "" "" and not ""%20"")
- added ""-downloadlist [list]"" where [list] is a text file with URL's on each line

1.6.02
- small fix on caculating md5sum where old version didnt pad out to 32chars with zeros on the left side- quick Archive intergity fix after injecting source code into .jar after it compiled.- no new functionality, md5 issue doesnt affect -update on old versions.
1.6.0
- NOW DOES NOT NEED ANY SCRIPT FILES!
- Added the ability to download files from the internet
- Added a switch to download any file off the internet, if needed (useless for most people, but included it in case I wanted it in the future.)
- Added the ability to check what version the .jar is. (Using MD5 hashes, timestamps, and the BuildID file)
- Added ""-update"" to download new versions of MLG directly from github.
- Updated estimated time.  Now shows up on loop 2+ instead of loop 4+.
- Standard % output of the Server should look nicer now.
- Code Refactoring
- Code Formatting
- Code Optimization

1.5.1
- pr0f1x: Added the ""save-all"" command to be sent to the server before shutting it down.
- pr0f1x: Added a 40 second wait before shutting down.
- Morlok8k: Made 40 second wait optional.
- Morlok8k: Changed the Dimensions code.  (I had assumed it would be DIM-1, DIM-2, etc.  but it turned out to be DIM-1 and DIM1. Change reflects Server output of ""Level n"")
- Morlok8k: Config file is automatically updated to reflect these changes.
- Morlok8k: Cleaned up code.

1.5.0
- Supports Server Beta 1.6.4 (& hopefully future versions as well, while remaining backward compatible.)
- Added ""-a"",""-alt"" to use alternate method (a slightly simplier version of 1.3.0's code - pure verbose only)
- Added world specific output for 9 dimensions (DIM-1 is the Nether, DIM-2 through DIM-9 dont exist yet, but if and when they do, you can configure it's text).  (""Level 0"", the default world, is displayed as the worlds name)
- Updated Config File for these Dimensions.
- Reads and outputs the Seed to the output. (If you had used text for the Seed, Minecraft converts it into a number. This outputs the number.)
- Changed the default 300 blocks to 380.  The server now makes a 400x400 square block terrain instead of 320x320.  Thus it is faster because there are less loops.  To use the old way, use ""-i300""
- Added total Percentage done (technically, it displays the % done once the server finishes...)
- Added debugging output vars of conf file (disabled - need to re-compile source to activate)

		+ (the goal is to have MLG be configureable, so it can work on any version of the server, past or present.)

*** 1.4.5 (pre 1.5.0) ***
- sorry!  I shouldn't release untested code...
*************************

1.4.4
- Added ablilty to ignore [WARNING] and [SEVERE] errors with ""-w""

1.4.3
- Fixed ""-ps"",""-printspawn"" as I had forgot I had broken it in 1.4.0 - due to config file change.

1.4.2
- No New Features
- Changed non-verbose mode to display server progress on the same line, saving a lot of space.
	- This couldn't wait for 1.5.0 ...  I (Morlok8k) liked it too much.

1.4.0
- Future Proofing
- Configurble Server Message reading. (If server updates and breaks MLG, you can add the new text!)
- Updated config file, and auto updating from old format.
- Added % of spawn area to non-verbose output.
- Removed datetime stamps from server output in verbose mode
- Other Misc fixes.

1.3.0
- Fixed Problems with Minecraft Beta 1.3 -- Morlok8k

-----------------------------------------------

Corrodias:
1.2.0
- land generation now centers on the spawn point instead of [0, 0]
- the server is launched once before the spawn point is changed, to verify that it can run and to create a world if one doesn't exist
- added -printspawn [-ps] switch to print the current spawn coordinates to the console
- added -x and -y switches to override the X and Y offsets
- added -v switch, does the same as -verbose
- improved status message spacing to make things easier to read
- improved time estimation algorithm: it now averages the last 3 launches

1.1.0
- added MinecraftLandGenerator.conf file to hold the java command line and the server path
- added -conf solo switch to generate a .conf file
- added -verbose switch to output server output to the console (default is to ignore it)
- added -i switch to allow customizing the block increment size (default is 300)
- added instructions output in this version, i think
- improved status message output to include current iteration and total iterations

1.0.0
- initial release

-----------------------------------------------

Notes:
Due to changes in server beta 1.6, it now generates the nether as well as the world at the same time.
However, Since beta 1.9 and Minecraft 1.0, the nether or the end is no longer generated.
The ""Server Generation Fix Mod"" by Morlok8k can generate The Nether and The End.  Link: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1378775-

I recommend using MCEDIT to relight the map after you generate it. This will take a long time, but should fix all those incorrectly dark spots in your level.

#Issues
This mod is no longer under active development. I (lehjr) no longer have access to upload any new versions of MPS. Furthermore, a recent openJDK8 update killed the development environment for 1.12.2, and there will be no support from Forge to fix this. Lastly, all effort is going into Modular Power Armor, a successor to MPS. https://github.com/lehjr/ModularPowerArmor

# Minecraft Prometheus Exporter

A **Bukkit plugin** which exports Minecraft server stats for Prometheus.

If you're running multiple Minecraft servers behind a BungeeCord proxy, you might also be interested in [Bungeecord Prometheus Exporter](https://github.com/weihao/bungeecord-prometheus-exporter) for additional metrics!

## Quick Start

Drop the prometheus-exporter.jar into your Bukkit plugins directory and start your Minecraft server.

After startup, the Prometheus metrics endpoint should be available at ``localhost:9940/metrics`` (assuming localhost is the server hostname).

The metrics port can be customized in the plugin's config.yml (a default config will be created after the first use).

## Plugin config

Here's a default config with annotations.

```yml
# Note that the HTTP server binds to localhost by default.
# If your Prometheus runs on another host or inside a Kubernetes cluster
# set this to any reachable IP or 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces.
host: localhost
# The port can be changed in case it conflicts with any other application.
port: 9940
# Metrics can be enabled individually. Metrics which are disabled
# by default may have a performance impact on your server.
# See the rest of the README for more information.
enable_metrics:
  jvm_threads: true
  jvm_gc: true
  players_total: true
  whitelisted_players: true
  entities_total: true
  living_entities_total: true
  loaded_chunks_total: true
  jvm_memory: true
  players_online_total: true
  tps: true
  tick_duration_average: true
  tick_duration_median: true
  tick_duration_min: false
  tick_duration_max: true
  player_online: false
  player_statistic: false
```

## Prometheus config

Add the following job to the ``scrape_configs`` section of your Prometheus configuration:

### Single server

```yml
- job_name: 'minecraft'
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9940']
      labels:
        server_name: 'my-awesome-server'
```

### Multiple servers

You can use labels in your Prometheus scrape configuration to distinguish between multiple servers:

```yml
- job_name: 'minecraft'
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9940']
      labels:
        server_name: 'server1'
    - targets: ['localhost:9939']
      labels:
        server_name: 'server2'
```

## Import Grafana Dashboard

1. Navigate to Grafana -> Dashboards -> Import
1. Paste in or upload [minecraft-server-dashboard.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter/master/dashboards/minecraft-server-dashboard.json)
1. Update ""JVM Memory Used"" to reflect your server max memory (Default 8G)
1. Edit (bottom right widget) -> Options -> Gauage -> Max

## Available metrics

These are the stats that are currently exported by the plugin.

Label | Description
------------ | -------------
mc_players_total | Unique players on server (online + offline)
mc_whitelisted_players | Players count on the white list
mc_loaded_chunks_total | Chunks loaded per world
mc_players_online_total | Online players per world
mc_entities_total | Entities loaded per world (living + non-living)
mc_villagers_total | Villagers
mc_world_size | World size in bytes
mc_jvm_memory | JVM memory usage
mc_jvm_threads | JVM threads info
mc_tps | Server tickrate (TPS)
mc_tick_duration_median | Median Tick Duration (ns, usually last 100 ticks)
mc_tick_duration_average | Average Tick Duration (ns, usually last 100 ticks)
mc_tick_duration_min | Min Tick Duration (ns, usually last 100 ticks)
mc_tick_duration_max | Max Tick Duration (ns, usually last 100 ticks)

## Player metrics (experimental!)

:warning: **The following feature is against Prometheus best-practices and is not recommended for production servers!**

There is an option to export per-player statistics like the number of blocks mined, mobs killed, items used, etc.
The amount of data stored in Prometheus can dramatically increase when this is enabled as individual time-series
will be generated for each player that has ever been seen on the server. The statistic collection may also have an
impact on the Minecraft server performance for bigger servers but it has not been measured or tested.

On the other hand this should be quite safe for small private servers with limited players.

You can enable the experimental player export in the config.yaml.

```yaml
enable_metrics:
  player_online: true
  player_statistic: true
```

This will enable the additional metrics.

Label | Description
------------ | -------------
mc_player_statistic | Player statistics
mc_player_online | Online state by player name

There's a sample [dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter/master/dashboards/minecraft-players-dashboard.json)
available to get you started.

## Collect metrics about your own plugin

You can easily collect metrics about your own plugin.

### Include the Prometheus dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.prometheus</groupId>
    <artifactId>simpleclient_common</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
</dependency>
```

### Collect metrics

This pseudo code shows how you would count invocations of a plugin command.

```java
public class MyPluginCommand extends PluginCommand {

  // Register your counter
  private Counter commandCounter = Counter.build()
            .name(""mc_my_plugin_command_invocations_total"")
            .help(""Counter for my plugin command invocations"")
            .register();

  @Override
  public boolean execute​(CommandSender sender, String commandLabel, String[] args) {

    // Increment your counter;
    commandCounter.inc();

    // Do other stuff

    return true;
  }

}
```
### Supported Minecraft Versions
#### Officially supported

117,NoCheatPlus/NoCheatPlus,Java,"NoCheatPlus
---------
NoCheatPlus is a fork of the famous anti-cheat plugin [NoCheat](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/nocheat/) created by [Evenprime](https://github.com/Evenprime). NoCheatPlus attempts to enforce ""vanilla Minecraft"" mechanics, as well as preventing players from abusing weaknesses in Minecraft or its protocol, making your server more safe. Organized in different sections, various checks are performed to test players doing, covering a wide range including flying and speeding, fighting hacks, fast block breaking and nukers, inventory hacks, chat spam and other types of malicious behaviour. For a more complete list have a look at the always outdated [Features Page](https://github.com/NoCheatPlus/Docs/wiki/Features).

Installation
---------
* [Install a Spigot server](https://github.com/NoCheatPlus/NoCheatPlus/#obtain-a-build-of-spigot)
* [Download NoCheatPlus](https://github.com/NoCheatPlus/NoCheatPlus/#download)
* Drop the NoCheatPlus.jar in to the plugins folder.
* Start your Spigot/CraftBukkit server. (Using /reload can have unwanted side effects with players still online, but also with complex plugins and cross-plugin dependencies, so we don't recommend it. Usually it should work with NCP.)

Hints
---------
* Be sure that your Spigot/CraftBukkit and NoCheatPlus versions match together. The latest version of NCP is compatible with a wide range of CraftBukkit/Spigot versions ([See the notable builds page for a quick overview.]()).
* Don't use tabs in the config.yml file.
* Use [ProtocolLib](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/protocollib) for full efficiency of the fight checks and other. Using a version of ProtocolLib that is supported by NCP is essential, as otherwise some checks will be disabled.
* For compatibility with other plugins such as mcMMO, citizens and more check out [CompatNoCheatPlus](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/compatnocheatplus-cncp/).

* ([Server installation instructions](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/))

Compiling NoCheatPlus
---------
* NoCheatPlus used to be compiled with java 6 compliance (note OpenJDK, possibly we'll switch to 8 directly, once appropriate, e.g. with ProtocolLib dropping support for 7.).
* We use [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3 to handle the dependencies. Tested both with Eclipse and Jenkins is Maven 3.3.9.
* You can compile with this Maven goal: `mvn clean package`, for a build without any of the ""non free"" modules, which depened on not publicly downloadable resources, such as the CraftBukkit/Spigot server jar - the reflection based compatibility module is still contained. 
* In order to include a pre-built jar with the ""non free"" modules contained, use `-P nonfree_include`.
* To also (re-) build ""non free"" compatibility modules, use `-P nonfree_build` as well as activating the appropriate module to build via a profile such as `-P cbdev` - see the tables below for reference.
* Have a look at the NCPCompatNonFree sub module for reference on how to add custom compatibility modules. If you add custom modules with a different package naming than `fr.neatmonster`, you might have to update the includes section within  NCPCompatNonFreeJar as well. The related factories are located within the NCPPlugin module (e.g. MCAccessFactory).
* ""Non free"" jar file dependencies needed for the dedicated compat modules, which your local maven repository might be missing, can be installed manually.
Example for Eclipse with embedded maven:
Add a new maven build run configuration, name it appropriately, e.g. ```Install CB 1.7.5```.
Set goals to: ```install:install-file -Dfile=<PATH TO JAR> -DgroupId=org.bukkit -DartifactId=craftbukkit -Dversion=1.7.5-R0.1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar```
On Windows the <PATH TO JAR> might look like:  ```X:\...\craftbukkit\3042\craftbukkit-1.7.5-R0.1-20140408.020329-16.jar```
To let it run you might have to set the base directory, e.g. to ```${workspace_loc}```, it does not seem to have significance.
Do set the correct version alongside the file name. On newer version of maven, you might do with much simplified goals, because the pom files inside the jars are parsed.
  * **The latest versions of BuildTools.jar will automatically install the created server jars into the local .m2 repository (e.g. on linux) - provided configuration paths are standard. Thus you don't need to do this manually anymore, if you then build NCP with the specific profile, if you have run BuildTools.jar to generate the server jars on that machine/environment.**

Options and profiles related to enabling/disabling including/building ""non free"" compatibility modules.

| Profile | Parameter | Description |
| :------------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- |
| `-P nonfree_include` | _none_ | The ""non free"" modules are included via a pre-built jar file from the repository. |
| `-P nonfree_build` | _none_ | Enable building ""non free"" compatibility modules. The NCPCompatNonFree jar file is built/installed/(deployed). |
| _none_ | _none_ | The ""non free"" modules are neither built, nor included via a pre-built jar file. |

Profiles for choice of ""non free"" compatibility modules to build:

| Profile | Description |
| :------------------ | :-------------- |
| _none_ | Default build without any of the native access modules, might pose compatibility issues with latest Minecraft versions. The reflection based module is included here. |
| `-P all` | All compatibility modules. |
| `-P cbdev` | The latest version in development. |
| `-P spigot1_12_r1` | Spigot 1.12 R1 (MC 1.12-1.12.2). |
| `-P spigot1_11_r1` | Spigot 1.11 R1 (MC 1.11-1.11.2). |
| `-P spigot1_10_r1` | Spigot 1.10 R1 (MC 1.10-1.10.2). |
| `-P spigot1_9_r2` | Spigot 1.9 R2 (MC 1.9.4). |
| `-P spigot1_8_r3` | Spigot 1.8 R3 (MC 1.8.4-1.8.8). |
| `-P spigot1_7_r4` | Spigot 1.7 R4 (MC 1.7.10). |
| `-P cblegacy` | The pre-DMCA CraftBukkit builds. |

(On the long run, only the latest module for a major Minecraft release may be be kept, such as 1_8_r3 for all of 1.8.x.)

Minecraft Python Client Library!

This projects aims to be a modern, Python3-compatible, well-documented library for
communication with a MineCraft server.

Detailed information for developers can be found here:
`<http://pycraft.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

``start.py`` is a basic example of a headless client using the library
Use ``start.py --help`` for the options.

Supported Minecraft versions
----------------------------
pyCraft is compatible with the following Minecraft releases:

* 1.8, 1.8.1, 1.8.2, 1.8.3, 1.8.4, 1.8.5, 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.8.8, 1.8.9
* 1.9, 1.9.1, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 1.9.4
* 1.10, 1.10.1, 1.10.2
* 1.11, 1.11.1, 1.11.2
* 1.12, 1.12.1, 1.12.2
* 1.13, 1.13.1, 1.13.2
* 1.14, 1.14.1, 1.14.2, 1.14.3, 1.14.4
* 1.15, 1.15.1, 1.15.2
* 1.16, 1.16.1, 1.16.2, 1.16.3, 1.16.4, 1.16.5
* 1.17, 1.17.1
* 1.18, 1.18.1

In addition, some development snapshots and pre-release versions are supported:
`<minecraft/__init__.py>`_ contains a full list of supported Minecraft versions
and corresponding protocol version numbers.

Supported functionality
-----------------------
Although pyCraft is compatible any supported server, only a subset of all
packets are currently decoded or encoded by the library: those necessary
to remain connected to the server, those used for chat, and some others.

Developers wishing to use other functionality with pyCraft can contribute by
implementing packet classes for the desired packets, adding them under
`<minecraft/networking/packets>`_, and sending a pull request.

Supported Python versions
-------------------------
pyCraft is compatible with (at least) the following Python implementations:

* Python 3.5
* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8
* Python 3.9
* PyPy

Requirements
------------
- `cryptography <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography#cryptography>`_
- `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`_
- `PyNBT <https://github.com/TkTech/PyNBT>`_

The requirements are also stored in ``setup.py``

See the installation instructions for the cryptography library here: `<https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/>`_
but essentially ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` should cover everything.

For those interested in developement, you can also visit #forestry-dev.

### Building

You may want to adjust the ""./gradle.properties"" file to set your mc account as needed.

To setup, open a command line and run ""gradlew setupDecompWorkspace"". Then run the following depending on your IDE:

Eclipse: ""gradlew eclipse""
IntelliJ IDEA: ""gradlew idea genIntellijRuns""

To package, open a command line and type ""gradlew build"".

For mod authors: the Forestry maven is located at http://maven.ic2.player.to/net/sengir/forestry/

### Notes

Beware of ugly code.

Bugfixes are generally welcome. If you want to contribute something which changes game mechanics, please talk to someone with commit privileges first. Nothing is more frustrating than putting a lot of work and effort into a new game mechanic and then having the PR rejected because it doesn’t fit gameplay-wise.

**If you submit a PR you must accept the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/ForestryMC/ForestryMC). There is no way around that, since otherwise changing the license later - even to something more permissive! - , becomes close to impossible.**

### Setup

#### What's needed
- Internet connection
- At least 4gb of ram
- Java JDK (1.8)
- Java JRE (1.8)
- An IDE (The setup is for Eclipse, but MCP can also be setup on [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtMhtp6QQoY))

#### Video!
Now a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSKu_zhPKc8) is available, showing how to set up the client. - The video is not up to date and a step is missing. Until that is updated you can watch that video and then come back and do the last step (adding javaws to your build path)

#### Let's get started
_Note: the instructions in italic apply ONLY to Eclipse, if you have a different IDE, [search how to set the project up on Google](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+setup+Minecraft+Coders+Pack+in+%5BMY+IDE%5D)_

- Download [Minecraft Coders Pack 918 (1.8.8)](http://www.modcoderpack.com/files/mcp918.zip) _(or MCP)_
- Unzip the MCP into a folder and enter it
- Double click the ""decompile"" bat file inside of the folder and wait for the assets to be copied
- When the message ""== Decompiling client using fernflower =="" pops up inside of the terminal you can close the window (there is no need to actually decompile the MCP)
- Download the project as ZIP
- Enter the ""src"" folder
- Delete the ""minecraft"" folder, if any is present
- Copy the folder ""minecraft"" from the project's ZIP into the ""src"" folder
- _Launch Eclipse into the ""eclipse"" folder (that is inside the folder you decompiled the MCP in) as workspace_
- Optionally delete the Server project (it is safe to do so)
- _Optionally enable the @formatting tags (Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter -> Edit -> Expand ""Off/On tags"" -> Tick the ""Enable Off/On tags"" -> Change the Profile Name (or you will not be able to save) -> OK -> Apply and Close)_
- Change the JRE version from JRE1\_6 to JRE1\_8 _(Right click on ""Client"" -> Build Path -> Libraries -> Scroll to the bottom -> Double click ""JRE System"" -> Choose a JRE1\_8 -> Finish -> Apply and Close)_
- Add the javaws.jar to your project buildpath (the file is located here: ""JAVA_PATH\jre1.8.0_VERSION\lib\javaws.jar"", where ""JAVA_PATH"" is where your java is installed (""C:\Program Files\Java\"", or ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\"" for 64-bit computers, is the default path on Windows) and ""VERSION"" is the java version you have installed.

"
124,mcedit/pymclevel,Python,"Python library for reading Minecraft levels.

Can read Alpha levels, Indev levels, and Creative levels (with help).

Includes a command-line client (mce.py)

Requires numpy and PyYaml.

Read mclevel.py to get started.

See LICENSE.txt for licensing terms.



mce.py is a command-line editor for SMP maps. It can be used interactively from a terminal, accept editing commands on standard input, or run a single editing command from the shell.

Sample usage:

$ python mce.py

    Usage:

    Block commands:
        clone <sourcePoint> <sourceSize> <destPoint>
        fill <blockType> [ <point> <size> ]
        replace <blockType> [with] <newBlockType> [ <point> <size> ]

        export <filename> <sourcePoint> <sourceSize>
        import <filename> <destPoint>

        analyze

    Player commands:
        player [ <player> [ <point> ] ]
        spawn [ <point> ]

    Entity commands:
        removeEntities [ <EntityID> ]

    Chunk commands:
        createChunks <point> <size>
        deleteChunks <point> <size>
        prune <point> <size>
        relight [ <point> <size> ]

    World commands:
        degrief

    Editor commands:
        save
        reload
        load <filename> | <world number>
        quit

    Informational:
        blocks [ <block name> | <block ID> ]
        help [ <command> ]

    Points and sizes are space-separated triplets of numbers ordered X Y Z.
    X is position north-south, increasing southward.
    Y is position up-down, increasing upward.
    Z is position east-west, increasing westward.

    A player's name can be used as a point - it will use the
    position of the player's head. Use the keyword 'delta' after
    the name to specify a point near the player.

    Example:
       codewarrior delta 0 5 0

    This refers to a point 5 blocks above codewarrior's head.

126,jacobwgillespie/heroku-minecraft,CoffeeScript,"# Heroku Minecraft

#### Minecraft finds a way.

This is a very alpha-quality Heroku app that runs a Minecraft server on a single dyno.

#### Limitations

Since Heroku is a bit of a weird platform, there are a couple of caveats to running a Minecraft server on it.

* Since Heroku no longer supports TCP routing, we're proxying the connection through WebSockets. This means each client will have to run a little tool to turn the WebSocket connection back into a regular TCP Minecraft connection. This is detailed below in the ""Client"" section.

* Heroku has no persistant storage, so you will have to have an [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com) account and an Amazon S3 bucket ready to store your world data. Your world data will be automatically synced to and from S3 in the background.

## Server Setup

1. Clone this repository using git (or, if it's easier, [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com), or [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com)).

2. Create a new Heroku app with a custom buildpack.

   ```bash
   $ heroku create my-app-name --buildpack https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git
   ```

3. Choose your Minecraft server version (default 1.8.3).

   ```bash
   $ heroku config:add MC_VERSION=1.8.3
   ```

4. Add your Amazon AWS credentials and S3 bucket name to the Heroku configuration. This enables data persistence. Otherwise, your server will be wiped each time it is restarted.

   ```bash
   $ heroku config:add AWS_KEY=xxxxxxx AWS_SECRET=yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy S3_BUCKET=my-bucket-name
   ```

5. Push the app to Heroku.

   ```bash
   $ git push heroku master
   ```

## Client Setup

Install https://github.com/leonardosantos/hmwtc, then:

   ```bash
   $ hmwtc my-app-name.herokuapp.com
   ```

## Credits

Original implementation by [Jacob Gillespie](https://github.com/jacobwgillespie).

Basically these are [original Malmö missions](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/raw/master/sample_missions/MalmoMissionTable_CurrentTasks_2016_06_14.pdf) with only `<PrioritiseOffscreenRendering>` added to speed up training.

## Installation

1. Install the dependencies for your OS: [Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/blob/master/doc/install_windows.md), [Linux](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/blob/master/doc/install_linux.md), [MacOSX](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/blob/master/doc/install_macosx.md). You can skip Torch, Mono and ALE parts.

2. Install [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) and its dependencies.
 ```
pip install gym
```

3. Download and install [minecraft_py](https://github.com/tambetm/minecraft-py).
 ```
git clone https://github.com/tambetm/minecraft-py.git
cd minecraft-py
# NB! `minecraft_py` should be installed to writable user directory, either in virtualenv or with `--user` option.
python setup.py install
```

4. Download and install `gym-minecraft`:

 ```
git clone https://github.com/tambetm/gym-minecraft.git
cd gym-minecraft
python setup.py install
```

 `gym-minecraft` needs `pygame` to render Minecraft screen. It is best to have pygame installed via your system commands, i.e. `sudo apt-get install python-pygame` or `conda install pygame`. Otherwise setup will automatically download and compile `pygame`. This might need some additional dependencies though, see instructions for [Ubuntu](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/CompileUbuntu), [OSX](http://pygame.org/wiki/MacCompile) or [Windows](http://pygame.org/wiki/CompileWindows).

5. Run once following snippet:
 ```
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

import minecraft_py

proc, port = minecraft_py.start()
minecraft_py.stop(proc)
```
 Basically Minecraft downloads and compiles everything on first start, this snippet just starts `minecraft_py` in debug mode, so you can see when Minecraft gets stuck.

## Running

```python
import gym
import gym_minecraft

env = gym.make('MinecraftBasic-v0')
env.init(start_minecraft=True)
env.reset()

done = False
while not done:
        env.render()
        action = env.action_space.sample()
        obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

env.close()
```

NB! Running Minecraft for the first time might take a while as it downloads and compiles itself. Next time the startup time should be shorter, but still around 30 seconds. In active development phase you might want to start one permanent Minecraft process in background and remove `start_minecraft=True`, see [wiki](https://github.com/tambetm/gym-minecraft/wiki/Parallel).

## Overriding default settings

The default settings for environments might not be optimal for you. Luckily you can easily override them using `init()`.

For example to use discrete actions instead of continuous actions:

```python
env = gym.make('MinecraftBasic-v0')
env.init(allowDiscreteMovement=[""move"", ""turn""])
```

To use continuous actions instead of discrete actions:

```python
env = gym.make('MinecraftBasic-v0')
env.init(allowContinuousMovement=[""move"", ""turn""])
```

To use different video resolution:

```python
env = gym.make('MinecraftBasic-v0')
env.init(videoResolution=[40, 30])
```

More documentation about configuration options is in [wiki](https://github.com/tambetm/gym-minecraft/wiki/Configure).

132,andrewminer/crafting-guide,CoffeeScript,"# Crafting Guide

Crafting Guide is the ultimate step-by-step guide for making anything in Minecraft. From your first [crafting table](http://crafting-guide.com/item/crafting_table) all the way up to your IndustrialCraft2 [QuantumSuit Bodyarmor](http://crafting-guide.com/item/quantumsuit_bodyarmor), Crafting Guide breaks down the recipes to raw ingredients and displays step-by-step instructions for what to craft, how much to craft, and in what order.  It also supports crafting multiple items at once, and can even include crafting the necessary tools in the step-by-step instructions.

## Adding new features

If there's something you'd like to see Crafting Guide do, feel free to open an issue against this project. Be sure to describe exactly what you have in mind, and explain why you think it would benefit everyone who uses Crafting Guide.  If you like, you can even clone the repository and get started on implementing it yourself!

## Adding a new Mod

Is Crafting Guide missing a mod you use?  Check out the [Adding a new Mod](https://github.com/andrewminer/crafting-guide/wiki/Adding-support-for-a-new-Mod) page for full details on how to add support for your favorite mod.  No programming required!

133,TheRemote/RaspberryPiMinecraft,Shell,"This script will automatically download and configure the Paper Minecraft server!<br>
For the full article and guide visit https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-minecraft-server-script-with-startup-service/<br>

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
To get started / install the server type:<br>
<pre>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRemote/RaspberryPiMinecraft/master/SetupMinecraft.sh | bash</pre><br>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>
To get help you may open an issue here or visit my web site at https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-minecraft-server-script-with-startup-service/ which contains lots of comments from myself and users helping each other out!

<h2>Changing Minecraft Server Versions</h2>
If a new version of Minecraft is out and the script hasn't been updated yet you can change it in the SetupMinecraft.sh script.  If you use the command nano SetupMinecraft.sh it will be the first line in the file like this:<br>
<br>
Version=""1.18.1""<br>
AllowLocalCopy=""1""<br>
<br>
Make sure to change AllowLocalCopy=""1"" to tell the script you want to actually run the local copy instead of the latest version.<br>
Note that for this to work the Paper Minecraft server must also have released the latest version or the download will fail.  You can check here: <a href=""https://papermc.io/downloads"">https://papermc.io/downloads</a><br>

<h2>Check Java Version</h2>

<p>Sometimes if you have multiple versions of Java installed the wrong version of Java will be selected as the default.  If the server didn't start check that the right version of Java is selected with this command:</p>
<p>If you get the message ""<em>update-alternatives: error: no alternatives for java</em>"" then you only have one version of Java installed and can skip to the next section.</p>
<p>If you are presented with a list of choices then your machine has multiple versions of Java installed.  It will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>update-alternatives: warning: /etc/alternatives/java has been changed (manually or by a script); switching to manual updates only
There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1101      auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1101      manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1081      manual mode
</code></pre>
<p>You will usually want to just select the newest version of OpenJDK that is listed so you would type 0 and press enter.  In some cases on some platforms you may want to switch to the official Oracle JDK although I strongly recommend sticking with OpenJDK!</p>

<h2>Tested Distributions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi OS - Bullseye/Buster/Stretch</li>
<li>Ubuntu / Ubuntu Server 22.04 / 21.10 / 20.04 (LTS)</li>
<li>Debian 11 Bullseye / Debian 10 Buster / Debian 9 Stretch</li>
<li>Arch Linux</li>
<li>TinkerOS Stretch</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting Note - Oracle Virtual Machines</h2>
A very common problem people have with the Oracle Virtual Machine tutorials out there that typically show you how to use a free VM is that the VM is much more difficult to configure than just about any other product / offering out there.<br>
The symptom you will have is that nobody will be able to connect.<br>
It is because there are several steps you need to take to open the ports on the Oracle VM.  You need to both:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Set the ingress ports (TCP/UDP) in the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) security list</li>
  <li>*and* set the ingress ports in a Network Security Group assigned to your instance</li>
</ul><br>
Both of these settings are typically required before you will be able to connect to your VM instance.  This is purely configuration related and has nothing to do with the script or the Minecraft server itself.<br><br>
I do not recommend this platform due to the configuration difficulty but the people who have gone through the pain of configuring an Oracle VM have had good experiences with it after that point.  Just keep in mind it's going to be a rough ride through the configuration for most people.<br><br>

</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting Note - Hyper-V</h2>
There is a weird bug in Hyper-V that breaks UDP connections on the Minecraft server.  The fix for this is that you have to use a Generation 1 VM with the Legacy LAN network driver.<br>

</ul>

<h3>September 15th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to allow OpenJDK 17 which is now the default ""snap""</li>
</ul>

<h3>September 2nd 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to Paper Minecraft Server API v2</li>
</ul>

<h3>August 1st 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a missing -A parameter for a curl command (thanks davie2000, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/RaspberryPiMinecraft/issues/27"">issue #27</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 27th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added PATH variable to scripts to improve compatibility on some distros</li>
<li>Server now fixes permissions upon startup</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 21st 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Switched from wget to curl to fix spacing issues experienced by some users</li>
<li>Added error redirection to crontab line to help diagnose failures during scheduled restarts</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 19th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where SetupMinecraft.sh could throw an error if no Java version was installed</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 17th 2021</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed server name prompt</li>
    <li>Added username missing to fix service issue</li>
    <li>Reduced memory recommendation by 100MB to allow more space for the OS / other processes since newer versions of Minecraft are requiring more memory.  Remember, if you don't leave enough memory for other things the Minecraft server will crash for memory issues, but it's because you set it too high (counterintuitive I know) and didn't leave enough for the OS and it killed your Minecraft server to prevent the entire OS from crashing.</li>
    <li>Added in check to ensure start.sh and other scripts are not being ran as root.  If this happens you have to use sudo screen -r to find the screen and the permissions will be wrong since root isn't the owner of the server files</li>
    <li>If you know you ran the script/server as root (which starts creating files owned by root instead of the regular user) and your server won't start/is wonky run the fixpermissions script from your server folder with ./fixpermissions.sh and it will correct them for you!</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 15th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added safety check for path to server -- please use the default path of ~ if you aren't familiar with fully qualified Linux paths/directories -- you really don't want to change the safe defaults unless you have a really specific need.</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 14th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a issue that was causing backups to not rotate (it should only keep 10).  Thanks Olli</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 8th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.17.1</li>
<li>Update documentation to explain new AllowLocalCopy=""1"" flag.  This flag tells the script not to run the latest online version and to run the local copy.  You want to use this if you are changing the version or making any modifications to the script itself before running it.</li>
<li>Added update.sh convenience script that calls the latest version of SetupMinecraft.sh</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where having an OpenJDK greater than 16 was not triggering the snap configuration (usually only seen on the cutting edge Ubuntu flavors)</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 5th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with SetupMinecraft.sh saving scripts to the home folder instead of the minecraft folder (thanks Ryan A J.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 3rd 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add option to choose a custom directory instead of forcing the home path</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 24th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed installation of OpenJDK above OpenJDK 16 as the Paper Minecraft server is not working with versions higher than 16</li>
<li>If you have a higher version of Java installed use the following command: sudo update-alternatives –config java and select OpenJDK 16</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 19th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>1.17 Release</li>
<li>Make sure you have backups and take copies of your backups and place them outside the Minecraft folder to be 100% safe</li>
<li>Once running the new version you can't go back to the old one without restoring a backup because it writes new stuff in your server the old version doesn't understand and crashes on</li>
<li>As long as you have backups you should be okay!</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 16th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raised minimum OpenJDK requirement to 16 in preparation for the 1.17 Paper Minecraft server release</li>
<li>If a new enough OpenJDK is not available in apt (Raspberry Pi OS is on OpenJDK 11 for example) it will be installed via snapd</li>
<li>If snapd is not installed it will ask you if you want to install it (reboot required) or abort</li>
<li>After the reboot run SetupMinecraft.sh again and it will finish installing OpenJDK 16!  Be patient, it can take some time, even 10-15 minutes on a good connection and longer on a bad one</li>
<li>Sorry for the inconvenience, there isn't an easier way to get it until the Raspberry Pi OS apt repositories are updated!</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 12th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed syntax error (thanks aruthir!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 10th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added OpenJDK 17 and 18 placeholders for prerequisite installations</li>
<li>Added a fallback to the non-headless JRE for platforms that don't offer that metapackage</li>
<li>Paper Minecraft 1.17 is not yet available but should be soon.  If you go to https://papermc.io/api/v1/paper/ and see 1.17 in the list it's available and you can change the version variable at the very top of SetupMinecraft.sh otherwise it hasn't been released yet.  Should be soon!</li>
</ul>

<h3>March 22nd 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lowered amount of recommended memory by a flat 200MB due to so many people having ""Out of Memory"" errors</li>
<li>Note:  Nobody has ever really been ""out of memory"" on the Pi since like the Pi 1.  The problem is you're using TOO MUCH.</li>
<li>If you're getting memory related crashes you need to turn your memory DOWN.  The server will recommend lower amounts going forward.</li>
</ul>

<h3>March 16th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added backup rotation - server keeps the last 10 backups by default</li>
<li>If you want to change the amount of backups held it is located in the ""start.sh"" script with a comment of '# Rotate backups -- keep most recent 10'</li>
<li>This adds a little responsibility for saving really old backups but fixes the issue I and many others have had of the server getting filled with backups and crashing</li>
</ul>

<h3>January 31st 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.16.5</li>
<li>Server now takes ownership of server files on each start to prevent folks a whole heap of trouble and heartache when restoring backups/moving files/etc.</li>
<li>Added check to make sure script isn't being ran as sudo to prevent installing to the /root folder</li>
</ul>

<h3>December 5th 2020</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.16.4</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where if your username on the Pi was Minecraft it would cause the script to break (thanks Minecraftschurli, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/RaspberryPiMinecraft/pull/20"">pull request #20</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenJDK 10 to try to be installed even if OpenJDK 11 installation was successful</li>
</ul>

<h3>September 25th 2020</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.16.3</li>
</ul>

<h3>August 28th 2020</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.16.2</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 4th 2020</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.16.1</li>
</ul>

<h3>January 25th 2020</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.15.2</li>
</ul>

<h3>December 28th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Backup system now takes a backup of your entire server folder (minus logs and cache) instead of just the world folders.  This mean it now backs up things like server.properties and other worlds if you are running a multiverse setup.</li>
</ul>

<h3>December 20th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated to version 1.15.1</li>
<li>Added more information to script installation warnings to help with initial configuration</li>
<li>Added warning to 2700MB limit on 32 bit operating systems explaining that you can lift the 3 GB limit by using a 64 bit Pi distribution</li>
<li>Cleaned up Java installation in setup script</li>
</ul>

<h3>August 26th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a silly bug causing recommended memory to be stuck at 2700</li>
</ul>

<h3>August 25th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved server startup detection after running SetupMinecraft</li>
<li>Added terminal colors to improve visibility</li>
<li>Cleaned up script substantially by breaking out duplicate code to functions</li>
<li>Fixed issue where when reconfiguring an existing server you would not be prompted to configure daily reboots</li>
<li>Removed /boot/config.txt tweaks as they are no longer compatible with Pi 4</li>
</ul>

<h3>August 24th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>To prevent startup failure on 32bit ARM the maximum memory for the Minecraft server is capped at 2700MB. This is a per process limitation of 32 bit on ARM and Linux. This restriction can be lifted by using a 64 bit operating system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 19th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated development version to 1.14.4</li>
<li>Added OpenJDK 13 support</li>

135,Alpha21016/Minecraft-Digital-Circuit,,"# Minecraft-Digital-Circuit

本项目利用Minecraft游戏中的简单信号元件构建出复杂的组合和时序数字“电路”，通过一种直观的三维可视化方式展示一个较为纯粹的可计算模型。这个模型不需要考虑现实中的晶体管电路所涉及到的电气特性和器件工艺等问题，是一个虚拟的图灵完备的逻辑结构。

在saves目录下包含三个存档

用于教学的存档Digital-Circuit-Basic，里面搭建了常用的从简单到复杂的数字电路结构，该存档适用于Minecraft-1.12版本及以上，我自己用的是1.12.2。
这个存档的元件和模块列表说明在“docs/教学存档单元和模块列表.xlsx”。

我以前的大型作品Alpha21016分为两个存档，一个是最终版演示存档，一个是加减乘除计算器演示存档。
之所以分开是因为最终版的存档里为了让CPU的电路简化，四则运算计算器已经被我废弃了，所以我把很久以前刚建完四则运算计算器时的存档单独列出来。
最终版里包含CPU，特殊函数计算器，显示屏，时钟等电路结构。
这两个存档必须在1.4.7版本打开才能顺利运行，因为这个游戏版本过于古老，如果网上寻找不到可以到知乎上私信我。
如果是自行在别处下载的1.4.7游戏程序，需要额外安装能够加载更多区块的插件，因为游戏中超出视野之外的电路是不会运行的。
尽量保证加载范围/渲染距离能覆盖至少320x320的范围，这需要较强的CPU性能，单核性能较强的双核及以上酷睿处理器最为合适。
这个作品并没有全部完成，在游戏中建造十万门以上的大规模数字电路，后期的维护和调试成本过高，因为时间和精力的原因没有将全部的指令集完成，不过CPU已经具有完整的流水线结构。由于年代久远，当时的很多文档资料已经遗失，所以这个项目的电路阅读起来会很困难，而且运行可能存在一些bug。我重新写了CPU部分的演示和结构文档，配有图片将CPU的各个结构描述了一下。

建议直接看教学存档即可了解Minecraft数字电路比较核心的部分。教学存档里都是单独制作的经过反复调试校验的电路模块，可以视作一套标准单元库，输入输出标识以及功能描述都较为清晰。
另外我使用了一个很有用的第三方工具软件，叫MCEdit，可以方便快捷地编辑游戏存档中的三维结构，使得电路搭建比纯手搭节约了很多时间，下载这个工具可以去MCEdit Unified官网。
关于介绍的文档目前没有写完，日后会继续完善。

注意！！！
所有存档如果存在打开无响应或永久加载中的情况，先重启游戏，将渲染距离调低，然后新开一个空存档，进入空存档后再退出到主界面，之后再加载电路存档就可以正常进入了。但是CPU的存档进入后还需要把渲染距离调整回较大的数值，否则电路无法正常运行，在退出存档前再把渲染距离调小就能保证下次能顺利进入存档。这是游戏程序机制的缺陷，暂时没有更方便的解决办法。

更新记录：

2020-08-03更新：教学存档中增加键盘和显示器模块，详见“教学存档单元和模块列表.xlsx”。

2019-09-28更新：增加文档“异或门和全加器最简结构设计原理”，有详细的基础电路设计思路。教学存档中增加了粘性活塞版的与门。

2019-09-23更新：教学存档中增加部分精简版的基础电路模块，quiz中增加第6个问题，内容是关于建造全加器。

2019-09-22更新：教学存档中增加了quiz模块，里面暂时有5个问题，以后还会增加。我给的参考答案在每个问题旁边的小木屋内，每道题并不一定只有唯一解。

2019-09-20更新：教学存档中增加了部分基础电路模块比如或非门，与非门，RS或非触发器等。完善了模块列表文档，列出了每个电路模块的坐标以便于寻找。

136,fogleman/Craft,C,"## Craft

Minecraft clone for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Just a few thousand lines of C using modern OpenGL (shaders). Online multiplayer support is included using a Python-based server.

http://www.michaelfogleman.com/craft/

![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/SH7wcas.png)

### Features

* Simple but nice looking terrain generation using perlin / simplex noise.
* More than 10 types of blocks and more can be added easily.
* Supports plants (grass, flowers, trees, etc.) and transparency (glass).
* Simple clouds in the sky (they don't move).
* Day / night cycles and a textured sky dome.
* World changes persisted in a sqlite3 database.
* Multiplayer support!

### Download

Mac and Windows binaries are available on the website.

http://www.michaelfogleman.com/craft/

See below to run from source.

### Install Dependencies

#### Mac OS X

Download and install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
if you don't already have it. You may use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to simplify
the installation:

    brew install cmake

#### Linux (Ubuntu)

    sudo apt-get install cmake libglew-dev xorg-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
    sudo apt-get build-dep glfw

#### Windows

Download and install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
and [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). Add `C:\MinGW\bin` to your `PATH`.

Download and install [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html) so that
CURL/lib and CURL/include are in your Program Files directory.

Use the following commands in place of the ones described in the next section.

    cmake -G ""MinGW Makefiles""
    mingw32-make

### Compile and Run

Once you have the dependencies (see above), run the following commands in your
terminal.

    git clone https://github.com/fogleman/Craft.git
    cd Craft
    cmake .
    make
    ./craft

### Multiplayer

After many years, craft.michaelfogleman.com has been taken down. See the [Server](#server) section for info on self-hosting.

#### Client

You can connect to a server with command line arguments...

```bash
./craft [HOST [PORT]]
```

Or, with the ""/online"" command in the game itself.
    
    /online [HOST [PORT]]

#### Server

You can run your own server or connect to mine. The server is written in Python
but requires a compiled DLL so it can perform the terrain generation just like
the client.

```bash
gcc -std=c99 -O3 -fPIC -shared -o world -I src -I deps/noise deps/noise/noise.c src/world.c
python server.py [HOST [PORT]]
```

### Controls

- WASD to move forward, left, backward, right.
- Space to jump.
- Left Click to destroy a block.
- Right Click or Cmd + Left Click to create a block.
- Ctrl + Right Click to toggle a block as a light source.
- 1-9 to select the block type to create.
- E to cycle through the block types.
- Tab to toggle between walking and flying.
- ZXCVBN to move in exact directions along the XYZ axes.
- Left shift to zoom.

### Implementation Details

#### Terrain Generation

The terrain is generated using Simplex noise - a deterministic noise function seeded based on position. So the world will always be generated the same way in a given location.

The world is split up into 32x32 block chunks in the XZ plane (Y is up). This allows the world to be “infinite” (floating point precision is currently a problem at large X or Z values) and also makes it easier to manage the data. Only visible chunks need to be queried from the database.

#### Rendering

Only exposed faces are rendered. This is an important optimization as the vast majority of blocks are either completely hidden or are only exposing one or two faces. Each chunk records a one-block width overlap for each neighboring chunk so it knows which blocks along its perimeter are exposed.

Only visible chunks are rendered. A naive frustum-culling approach is used to test if a chunk is in the camera’s view. If it is not, it is not rendered. This results in a pretty decent performance improvement as well.

Chunk buffers are completely regenerated when a block is changed in that chunk, instead of trying to update the VBO.

Text is rendered using a bitmap atlas. Each character is rendered onto two triangles forming a 2D rectangle.

“Modern” OpenGL is used - no deprecated, fixed-function pipeline functions are used. Vertex buffer objects are used for position, normal and texture coordinates. Vertex and fragment shaders are used for rendering. Matrix manipulation functions are in matrix.c for translation, rotation, perspective, orthographic, etc. matrices. The 3D models are made up of very simple primitives - mostly cubes and rectangles. These models are generated in code in cube.c.

Transparency in glass blocks and plants (plants don’t take up the full rectangular shape of their triangle primitives) is implemented by discarding magenta-colored pixels in the fragment shader.

#### Database

User changes to the world are stored in a sqlite database. Only the delta is stored, so the default world is generated and then the user changes are applied on top when loading.

The main database table is named “block” and has columns p, q, x, y, z, w. (p, q) identifies the chunk, (x, y, z) identifies the block position and (w) identifies the block type. 0 represents an empty block (air).

In game, the chunks store their blocks in a hash map. An (x, y, z) key maps to a (w) value.

The y-position of blocks are limited to 0 <= y < 256. The upper limit is mainly an artificial limitation to prevent users from building unnecessarily tall structures. Users are not allowed to destroy blocks at y = 0 to avoid falling underneath the world.

#### Multiplayer

Multiplayer mode is implemented using plain-old sockets. A simple, ASCII, line-based protocol is used. Each line is made up of a command code and zero or more comma-separated arguments. The client requests chunks from the server with a simple command: C,p,q,key. “C” means “Chunk” and (p, q) identifies the chunk. The key is used for caching - the server will only send block updates that have been performed since the client last asked for that chunk. Block updates (in realtime or as part of a chunk request) are sent to the client in the format: B,p,q,x,y,z,w. After sending all of the blocks for a requested chunk, the server will send an updated cache key in the format: K,p,q,key. The client will store this key and use it the next time it needs to ask for that chunk. Player positions are sent in the format: P,pid,x,y,z,rx,ry. The pid is the player ID and the rx and ry values indicate the player’s rotation in two different axes. The client interpolates player positions from the past two position updates for smoother animation. The client sends its position to the server at most every 0.1 seconds (less if not moving).

Client-side caching to the sqlite database can be performance intensive when connecting to a server for the first time. For this reason, sqlite writes are performed on a background thread. All writes occur in a transaction for performance. The transaction is committed every 5 seconds as opposed to some logical amount of work completed. A ring / circular buffer is used as a queue for what data is to be written to the database.

In multiplayer mode, players can observe one another in the main view or in a picture-in-picture view. Implementation of the PnP was surprisingly simple - just change the viewport and render the scene again from the other player’s point of view.

#### Collision Testing

Hit testing (what block the user is pointing at) is implemented by scanning a ray from the player’s position outward, following their sight vector. This is not a precise method, so the step rate can be made smaller to be more accurate.

Collision testing simply adjusts the player’s position to remain a certain distance away from any adjacent blocks that are obstacles. (Clouds and plants are not marked as obstacles, so you pass right through them.)

#### Sky Dome

A textured sky dome is used for the sky. The X-coordinate of the texture represents time of day. The Y-values map from the bottom of the sky sphere to the top of the sky sphere. The player is always in the center of the sphere. The fragment shaders for the blocks also sample the sky texture to determine the appropriate fog color to blend with based on the block’s position relative to the backing sky.

#### Ambient Occlusion

Ambient occlusion is implemented as described on this page:

http://0fps.wordpress.com/2013/07/03/ambient-occlusion-for-minecraft-like-worlds/

#### Dependencies

* GLEW is used for managing OpenGL extensions across platforms.
* GLFW is used for cross-platform window management.
* CURL is used for HTTPS / SSL POST for the authentication process.
* lodepng is used for loading PNG textures.
* sqlite3 is used for saving the blocks added / removed by the user.
* tinycthread is used for cross-platform threading.

## Prerequisites
Here is the setup video for Windows 10:

[<img alt = ""Setup: Windows 10"" src = ""https://i.imgur.com/VVQrYbG.png"" width = 25% />](https://youtu.be/lrAIYPlvMZw?list=PL6_bLxRDFzoKjaa3qCGkwR5L_ouSreaVP)

The `pyglet` module is a necessary dependency for all episodes, the `nbtlib` & `base36` modules are necessary dependencies for all episodes starting with 11, and the `pyglm` module is necessary for the `community` directory. You can install them with PIP by issuing:

```shell
$ pip install --user pyglet nbtlib base36 pyglm
```

## Running

Run the following command in the directory of any episode to run the result from that episode:

```shell
$ python3 main.py
```

This tutorial requires Python version 3.8 minimum (#56, with only a few changes though, it can run on versions much lower).

## Community

The `community` directory is for experiments & contributions made by other people on the latest tutorial's code (see PR [#29](https://github.com/obiwac/python-minecraft-clone/pull/29)).
It more generally extends the project with functionality I've yet to cover in a tutorial or that I don't intend on covering at all.
Characteristic contributions are contributions which *add* something to the code.
Contributions which *fix* something are still merged on the source of all episodes.

The community has several features and options that can be toggled in `options.py`:
- Render Distance: At what distance (in chunks) should chunks stop being rendered
- FOV: Camera field of view

- Indirect Rendering: Alternative way of rendering that has less overhead but is only supported on devices supporting OpenGL 4.2
- Advanced OpenGL: Rudimentary occlusion culling using hardware occlusion queries, however it is not performant and will cause pipeline stalls and decrease performance on most hardware - mostly for testing if it improves framerate
- Chunk Updates: Chunk updates per chunk every tick - 1 gives the best performance and best framerate, however, as Python is an slow language, 1 may increase chunk building time by an ludicrous amount
- Vsync: Vertical sync, may yield smoother framerate but bigger frame times and input lag
- Max CPU Ahead frames: Number of frames that the CPU can go ahead of a frame before syncing with the GPU by waiting for it to complete the execution of the command buffer, using `glClientWaitSync()`
- Smooth FPS: Legacy CPU/GPU sync by forcing the flushing and completion of command buffer using `glFinish()`, not recommended - similar to setting Max CPU Ahead Frames to 0. Mostly for testing whether it makes any difference with `glClientWaitSync()`

- Smooth lighting: Smoothes the light of each vertex to achieve a linear interpolation of light on each fragment, hence creating a smoother light effect - it also adds ambient occlusion, to simulate light blocked by opaque objects (chunk update/build time will be severely affected by this feature)
- Fancy translucency: Better translucency blending, avoid weird looking artefacts - disable on low-end hardware
- Mipmap (minification filtering): Texture filtering used on higher distances. Default is `GL_NEAREST` (no filtering) (more info in `options.py`)
- Colored lighting: Uses an alternative shader program to achieve a more colored lighting; it aims to look similar to Beta 1.8+ (no performance loss should be incurred)
- Antialiasing: Experimental feature

139,WooMinecraft/WooMinecraft,Java,"# WooMinecraft - Self-hosted Minecraft Donations

[WooMinecraft](http://woominecraft.com) is a free Minecraft Donation plugin for your server that provides a self-hosted solution where you're the boss.  By leveraging a well known eCommerce plugin on the
WordPress side of things, we allow you to specify commands for product variations, general product commands, and resending of donations at any time.   
![WooMinecraft Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WooMinecraft/WooMinecraft/main/src/main/resources/wmc-logo.jpg)

## Config
Your config should look like the below section.
```
# Set this to the desired language file you wish to load.
#
# If your l10n is not available but one is that you know how to speak,consider
# contributing to this plugin at https://github.com/WooMinecraft/WooMinecraft/

# You must set this to your WordPress site URL.  If you installed WordPress in a
# subdirectory, it should point there.
url: ""http://playground.dev""

# If you are having issues with REST, or have disabled pretty permalinks. Set this to false.
# Doing so will use the old /index.php?rest_route=/wmc/v1/server/ base
# Setting this to false will also allow you to set the restBasePath value if you have altered your

prettyPermalinks: true

# If your REST API has a custom path base, input it here. 
# NOTE: This is only loaded if prettyPermalinks is set to false.
# Known good URL bases.
# - /wp-json/wmc/v1/server/
# - /index.php?rest_route=/wmc/v1/server/
restBasePath: """"

# This must match the WordPress key in your admin panel for WooMinecraft
# This is a key that YOU set, both needing to be identical in the admin panel
# and in this config file
# For security purposes, you MUST NOT leave this empty.
key: """"

# Allowed worlds the player needs to be in to run the commands.
# Disabled by default!
#whitelist-worlds:
#  - world

# Set to true in order to toggle debug information
debug: false
```

## How does it work?
This bridges the gap between PHP, and Java by leveraging both the bukkit/spigot API ( java ) and the WordPress API with WooCommerce support ( php ). It stores commands
per order, per player, per command ( yes you read that right ) in the WordPress database.  This plugin, either when an op requests it, or on a timer, sends a request to
the WordPress server to check for donations for all online players.

If online players have commands waiting to be processed, then all necessary commands are ran.  There is NO LIMIT to the type of commands you can set, `give`, `i`, `tp`, etc... all commands are ran
by the console sender, and not a player.

## Contributions

> This is a python based Minecraft server control tool

MCDReforged (abbreviated as MCDR) is a tool which provides the management ability of the Minecraft server using custom plugin system. It doesn't need to modify or mod the original Minecraft server at all

From in-game calculator, player high-light, to manipulate scoreboard, manage structure file and backup / load backup, you can implement these by using MCDR and related plugins

Great thanks to chino_desu and his [MCDaemon 1.0](https://github.com/kafuuchino-desu/MCDaemon) for the idea of such a cool Minecraft control tool

Contact me on discord: `Fallen_Breath#1215`

## Advantage

- It's running above the server. It doesn't need to modify the server at all which keep everything vanilla
- Hot-reloadable plugin system. You don't need to shut down the server to update the plugins
- Multi platform / server compatibility. Supports vanilla, paper, bungeecord etc. on Linux / Windows

## How it works?

MCDR uses [Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen) to start the server as a sub-process, then it has the ability to control the standard input / out stream of the server

Since the console output of a Minecraft server has a stable format and contains a large amount of useful information about the server, e.g. player chat messages, MCDR is able to parse and analyze the server output, abstract them into different events and dispatch them towards plugins for responding

With the help of Minecraft command system, MCDR can send Minecraft commands via the standard input stream to affect the actual Minecraft server

That's it, you can even think of MCDR as a robot that stares at the server console and can quickly respond to server output and input related commands if you like 

## Plugin

[Here](https://github.com/MCDReforged/PluginCatalogue) is a MCDR plugin collection repository

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/nicolaschan/minecraft-backup/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=LCbVC4TbYJ)](https://codecov.io/gh/nicolaschan/minecraft-backup)

Backup script for Minecraft servers on Linux. 
Supports servers running in [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen), [tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux), or with [RCON](https://wiki.vg/RCON) enabled. Supports `tar` file or [`restic`](https://restic.net/) backup backends.

## Features
- Create backups of your world folder
- Manage deletion of old backups
  - ""thin"" - keep last 24 hourly, last 30 daily, and use remaining space for weekly backups
  - ""sequential"" - delete oldest backup
- Works on vanilla (no plugins required)
- Print backup status to the Minecraft chat

## Install
```bash
wget https://github.com/nicolaschan/minecraft-backup/releases/latest/download/backup.sh
chmod +x backup.sh
```

Make sure your system has `tar` and your chosen compression algorithm (`gzip` by default) installed.
If using RCON, you will also need to have the [`xxd`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd) command.

## Usage
```bash
# If connecting with RCON:
./backup.sh -c -i /home/user/server/world -o /mnt/storage/backups -s localhost:25575:secret -w rcon

# If running on screen called ""minecraft"":
./backup.sh -c -i /home/user/server/world -o /mnt/storage/backups -s minecraft

# If running on tmux session 0:
./backup.sh -c -i /home/user/server/world -o /mnt/storage/backups -s 0 -w tmux 

# Using restic (and RCON)
export RESTIC_PASSWORD=""restic-pass-secret"" # your password here
./backup.sh -c -i /home/user/server/world -r /mnt/storage/backups-restic -s localhost:25575:secret -w rcon

# Using Docker and RCON
# You will have to set up networking so that this Docker image can access the RCON server
# In this example, the RCON server hostname is `server-host`
docker run \ 
  -v /home/user/server/world:/mnt/server \
  -v /mnt/storage/backups:/mnt/backups \
  ghcr.io/nicolaschan/minecraft-backup -c -i /mnt/server -o /mnt/backups -s server-host:25575:secret -w rcon
```

This will show chat messages (`-c`) and save a backup of `/home/user/server/world` into `/mnt/storage/backups` using the default thinning deletion policy for old backups.

Command line options:
```text
-a    Compression algorithm (default: gzip)
-c    Enable chat messages
-d    Delete method: thin (default), sequential, none
-e    Compression file extension, exclude leading ""."" (default: gz)
-f    Output file name (default is the timestamp)
-h    Shows this help text
-H    Set hostname for restic backup (restic only)
-i    Input directory (path to world folder, use -i once for each world)
-l    Compression level (default: 3)
-m    Maximum backups to keep, use -1 for unlimited (default: 128)
-o    Output directory
-p    Prefix that shows in Minecraft chat (default: Backup)
-q    Suppress warnings
-r    Restic repo name (if using restic)
-s    Screen name, tmux session name, or hostname:port:password for RCON
-t    Enable lock file (lock file not used by default)
-u    Lock file timeout seconds (empty = unlimited)
-v    Verbose mode
-w    Window manager: screen (default), tmux, RCON
```

### Automate backups with cron
- Edit the crontab with `crontab -e`
- Example for hourly backups:
```
00 * * * * /path/to/backup.sh -c -i /home/user/server/world -o /mnt/storage/backups -s minecraft
```

## Retrieving Backups
Always test your backups! Backups are in the `tar` format and compressed depending on the option you choose. To restore, first decompress if necessary and then extract using tar. You may be able to do this in one command if `tar` supports your compression option, as is the case with `gzip`:

Example:
```bash
mkdir restored-world
cd restored-world
tar -xzvf /path/to/backups/2019-04-09_02-15-01.tar.gz
```

The restored worlds should be inside the `restored-world` directory, possibly nested under the parent directories. Then you can move your restored world to your Minecraft server folder under the proper name and path so the Minecraft server uses it.

### With `restic`
Use [`restic restore`](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/050_restore.html) to restore from backup.

## Why not use `tar` directly?
If you use `tar` while the server is running, you will likely get an error like this because Minecraft autosaves the world periodically:
```
tar: /some/path/here/world/region/r.1.11.mca: file changed as we read it
```
To fix this problem, the backup script disables autosaving with the `save-off` Minecraft command before running `tar` and then re-enables autosaving after `tar` is done. 

## Help
- Make sure the compression algorithm you specify is installed on your system. (zstd is not installed by default)
- Make sure your compression algorithm is in the crontab's PATH
- Make sure cron has permissions for all the files involved and access to the Minecraft server's GNU Screen
- It's surprising how much space backups can take--make sure you have enough empty space
- Do not put trailing `/` in the `SERVER_DIRECTORY` or `BACKUP_DIRECTORY`
- If ""thin"" delete method is behaving weirdly, try emptying your backup directory or switch to ""sequential""

## Known Issues
There is a Minecraft bug [MC-217729](https://bugs.mojang.com/projects/MC/issues/MC-217729) in recent Minecraft server versions that cause them to automatically save the world even after receiving the `save-off` command. Until this is fixed, there is a chance that the backup will fail because the world files are modified by Minecraft in the process of creating the backup. This script will try to detect and report this problem if it does occur.

## Disclaimer
Backups are essential to the integrity of your Minecraft world. You should automate regular backups and **check that your backups work**. It is up to you to make sure that your backups work and that you have a reliable backup policy. 

Some backup tips:
- Drives get corrupted or fail! Backup to a _different_ drive than the one your server is running on, so if your main drive fails then you have backups.
- _Automate_ backups so you never lose too much progress.
- Check that your backups work from time to time.

# MCEdit 2.0

MCEdit 2.0 is the next version of MCEdit, the World Editor for Minecraft. MCEdit allows you to edit every aspect of
a Minecraft world, and to import and export .schematic files created by many programs including WorldEdit and the
original MCEdit 1.x. It is free to use and licensed under the BSD license.

MCEdit 2.0's development is in the alpha stage. Many features may be buggy or missing. To download MCEdit 2.0 anyway, head over to
http://www.mcedit.net/

The rest of this file is of interest to programmers only.

# Getting Started

This guide is written with Windows developers in mind. Linux / OS X developers can read how to install below. 
Windows developers are assumed to be using a unix shell such as the _GIT Bash_ included with the Windows distribution 
of Git.

- Install [Python for Windows v2.7.9](http://www.python.org/downloads/). Edit your PATH environment variable (or your 
.bashrc) to have both the `python27` and `python27\scripts` folders. (by default, `c:\python27;c:\python27\scripts;`)
- Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266). 
This is not needed if you already have MSVC 2008 (Visual Studio 9.0) or the Windows SDK 7.0 
installed, but you probably don't so install it anyway.
- Install virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv` (pip is now included with recent versions of Python)
- Update to the latest setuptools to make sure Cython modules compile: `pip install -U setuptools`
- Create a local clone of the MCEdit sources: `git clone https://github.com/mcedit/mcedit2`
- Using the `bash` shell, change directory to the local clone: `cd mcedit2`
- Create a virtualenv using `virtualenv ENV`
- Activate the virtualenv using `. ENV/scripts/activate`

A virtualenv is created in the local clone directory to keep MCEdit's required libraries isolated from those
installed in the systemwide Python folder. This prevents unpleasant surprises when you update a library 
for another project and later find it isn't compatible with MCEdit.

Now, install the required libraries. 

On Windows, `easy_install` is able to install binary installer packages into a virtualenv. Download each of the following and run `easy_install <module>.exe` while the virtualenv is active. Binary packages for the following are available at Chris Gohlke's page. Download the versions for Python 2.7, and make sure to download the `win32` versions if you installed the 32-bit Python (the default) or the `win-amd64` versions for 64-bit Python.

- [pyside](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#pyside) 
- [pyopengl](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#pyopengl) (be sure to grab `PyOpenGL-accelerate` too.)
- [pywin32](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#pywin32) (for registry access)
- [cython](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#cython) (for building `nbt.pyd`)
- [ipython](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#ipython) (for debugging)
- [pygments](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#pygments) (required by IPython) 
- [numpy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#numpy) **

Also use _pip_ to install these libraries:

- `pip install arrow` - a date/time class with nice text formatting.
- `pip install pyzmq` - Gohlke's pyzmq builds don't work on Windows XP

**Note that Gohlke's numpy builds use the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) which requires a license to use. If you 
have not purchased an MKL license (it's expensive) then you ***DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO DISTRIBUTE APPS*** built 
with it. I didn't notice any better performance with MKL regardless.

An alternative is to install the official builds of numpy from the [SourceForge Downloads](http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/)
but 64-bit builds are not provided. If you need a 64-bit build of numpy that does not include MKL, you will need to 
build it yourself. Also, the official builds are packed into a ""superpack"" installer which easy_install chokes on. 
Just open the installer in an archiving program like [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) and extract the SSE3 installer, 
then `easy_install` it.

Another alternative to downloading all of the above is to download all the packages 
[from my dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fw8u5f050r1m6lp/AABAYXOEAzmV_nfH0Qj9hUOwa?dl=0). Note that the 
64-bit numpy package is one I built myself, with several facilities (LAPACK, BLAS etc) disabled because I couldn't 
be bothered to find out why MSVC 64-bit chokes on them. MCEdit seems to run fine without them. Install 
`python-2.7.9.msi` first, then install [MSVC++ for Python](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266), 
then virtualenv, and create and activate a virtualenv as above. Install each of the .exe files using `easy_install` 
and make sure to `pip install arrow` too.

Once all of the requirements are met, install MCEdit itself into the virtualenv. This will build `nbt.pyd`, ensure 
both `mcedit2` and `mceditlib` are on the pythonpath, and also create an `mcedit2` script making it easy to launch 
the app. 

`python setup.py develop`

All that's left is to see if the app launches.

`mcedit2`

As a bonus, you can use the `-debug` flag to enable the Debug menu and a few extra widgets.

`mcedit2 -debug`

## Linux/OS X (not tested fully)

    cd (Your mcedit2 location)
    virtualenv ENV
    . ENV/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop
    mcedit2

If your distro packages python3 as the default version of python instead of python2, you will probably want to set your virtualenv to use python2, i.e.

    virtualenv -p python2 ENV

If you get a `Library not loaded: libpyside-python2.7.1.2.dylib` error, try running `pyside_postinstall.py -install` to fix this. 

If after that, you get a `Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui` error after that, try installing `qt` using a package manager like Homebrew or apt-get or similar equivalent on your distribution.   You may also need `libxslt-dev` and `python-dev` packages installed before the commands above will work.

Example: `brew install qt` etc. or:

    sudo apt-get install qt-sdk
    sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev
    sudo apt-get install python-dev

_Note: This information is not fully tested and might not work for you_

# Troubleshooting

- `python setup.py develop` or `build` produces the error `cannot find vcvarsall.bat` or similar.
Old version of setuptools don't know about MSVC++ for Python 2.7. Run `pip install --upgrade setuptools` to upgrade.

- When running mcedit2, `ImportError: cannot import name nbt` is produced.
The extension module `nbt.pyd` failed to build. Run `python setup.py develop` to rebuild it and look for any errors.
 The most likely error is the `vcvarsall.bat` error above.
 
- When running mcedit2, `ImportError: %1 is not a valid Win32 application` is produced.
This happens when switching between 32-bit and 64-bit Pythons on Windows. The `nbt.pyx` must be rebuilt after 
switching, so run `python setup.py develop` again.

[Compile This Project](#compile-this-project)

[Update Your Repository](#update-your-repository)

#### Set Up Java
The Java JDK is used to compile this project.

1. Download and install the Java JDK.
	* [Windows/Mac download link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).  Scroll down, accept the `Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for Java SE`, and download it (if you have a 64-bit OS, please download the 64-bit version).
	* Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below.  If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).
		* Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin`
		* Archlinux: `pacman -S jdk7-openjdk`
		* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk`
		* Fedora: `yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk`
2. Windows: Set environment variables for the JDK.
    * Go to `Control Panel\System and Security\System`, and click on `Advanced System Settings` on the left-hand side.
    * Click on `Environment Variables`.
    * Under `System Variables`, click `New`.
    * For `Variable Name`, input `JAVA_HOME`.
    * For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51` EXACTLY AS SHOWN (*or wherever your Java JDK installation is*), and click `Ok`.
    * Scroll down to a variable named `Path`, and double-click on it.
    * Append `;%JAVA_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `Ok`.  Make sure the location is correct; double-check just to make sure.
3. Open up your command line and run `javac`.  If it spews out a bunch of possible options and the usage, then you're good to go.

#### Set Up Git
Git is used to clone this repository and update your local copy.

1. Download and install Git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/).
	* *Optional*: Download and install a Git GUI client, such as SourceTree, Github for Windows/Mac, TortoiseGit, etc.  A nice list is available [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

#### Set Up This Project
This section assumes that you're using the command-line version of Git.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Set up ```ossrhUsername``` and ```ossrhPassword``` per [this](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html#credentials). If you to not have a sonatype.org account, just set these to anything.
2. Navigate to a place where you want to download this project (eg `C:\Github\Development\`) by executing `cd [folder location]`.  This location is known as `mcdev` from now on.
3. Execute `git clone git@github.com:ExtrabiomesXL/ExtrabiomesXL.git`.  This will download this project into a folder in `mcdev`.
4. Right now, you should have a directory that looks something like:

***
	mcdev
	\-ExtrabiomesXL
		\-This project's files (should have `build.gradle`, etc.)
***

#### Compile This Project
1. Execute `gradlew build`. If you did everything right, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` will be displayed after it finishes.
    * If you see `BUILD FAILED`, check the error output (it should be right around `BUILD FAILED`), fix everything (if possible), and try again.
3. Navigate to `mcdev\ExtrabiomesXL\build\libs`.
    *  You should see a `.jar` file named `[A.A.AA]ExtrabiomesXL-B.B.jar`, where A.A.AA is the `minecraft_version` value in `build.properties` and B.B is the `mod_version` value in `build.properties`. This is the mod file to be used with Minecraft.
    *  Additionally, you should see two more `.jar` files named `[A.A.AA]ExtrabiomesXL-deobf-B.B.jar` and `[A.A.AA]ExtrabiomesXL-deobf-B.B-src.jar`. These are, respectively, the development modfile and the source code. The development mod file can be used when testing mods that are under development.
4. Copy the first jar into your Minecraft mods folder, and you are done!

#### Update Your Repository
In order to get the most up-to-date builds, you'll have to periodically update your local repository and recompile this project.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to `mcdev/ExtrabiomesXL` in the console.
3. Make sure you have not made any changes to the local repository, or else there might be issues with Git.
	* If you have, try reverting them to the status that they were when you last updated your repository.
4. Execute `git pull master`.  This pulls all commits from the official repository that do not yet exist on your local repository and updates it.

* The skin preview differenciates between the Steve (4 pixel arm width) and Alex skin (3 pixel arm width) by checking the alpha value on the pixel at 54, 20. Therefore, the preview assumes that the skin is well formed and that the unallocated areas are transparent.
* Default skins: [Steve](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/steve.png) and [Alex](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/alex.png)
* Skin templates: [Steve](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/4px_reference.png) and [Alex](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/3px_reference.png)

### Cloning the repository

* Please go to our Discord server linked above for the newest info on compilation of this project. 

Note: you need git installed to do the following:
```
git clone --recursive
```
You need a git submodule for the project to compile.
If you don't yet have the submodule but already cloned the repository:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To get latest version of the submodule:
```
git submodule update --recursive --remote
```

### Compiling the mod
Note: on windows you need to run these commands without `./`

This command:
```
./gradlew build
```
Should be enough to build the mod, but if there are any issues, run `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` before `./gradlew build`.
The mod uses information from git repository to generate version number. Make sure you have the git repository before compiling.

### Setting up development environment
Note: on windows you need to run these commands without `./`

![IntelliJ IDEA](intellij-logo.png)

Run:
```
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```
then import it as gradle project into IDEA (if you already have something open, use File->new->project from existing sources)
Then run:
```
./gradlew genIntellijRuns
```
To be able to run the mod from within IDE. Then edit the generated run configurations and set `use classpath of module` to `CubicChunkc_main`
Then refresh gradle project in IDEA.

For development in IntelliJ IDEA the [MinecraftDev plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/8327-minecraft-development) is recommended.


#### Other IDEs:

Importing cubic chunks should be the same as any other Forge mod. If the IDE has gradle integration, import the mod as gradle project after setting
 up development environment.
 
To run this mod from your IDE you need to add at least the following JVM option:
```
-Dfml.coreMods.load=cubicchunks.asm.CubicChunksCoreMod
```

If you use a different IDE and know how to setup development environment in that IDEs - submit pull request adding that information to this file.

Some other useful options:

`-Dmixin.debug.verbose=true` - enable mixin verbose output
`-Dmixin.debug.export=true` - export classes after applying mixins to `run/.mixin.out/`, useful for debugging mixins
`-Dcubicchunks.debug=true` - enable cubic chunks debug options
`-XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow` - some parts of cubic chunks code cause fast throw hen they fail, use when you see exception with no stacktrace
`-Dmixin.checks.interfaces=true` - check that mixin classes implement all interface methods
`-Dfml.noGrab=false` - can be useful for debugging client on some systems, disables hiding mouse cursor

*If you rely on this software, please consider [donating](https://liberapay.com/offbeatwitch/donate) to help keep it maintained!*

Need to make it easy for people to install and play your modpack? The SKCraft Launcher platform may be for you if:

:heavy_check_mark: You want your own logo and branding on the launcher, with your own news feed  
:heavy_check_mark: You want to be able to update the modpack whenever you want  
:heavy_check_mark: You don't want to depend on anyone else  
:heavy_check_mark: There's several modpacks you want to provide as a set  
:heavy_check_mark: You want to provide 'hidden' modpacks that are only accessible by a secret code

It may not be for you if:

:small_orange_diamond: You made a cool modpack and you just want it out there  
:small_orange_diamond: You don't have a website or place for people to download files from  
:small_orange_diamond: You don't want anything to do with distributing the launcher

## What We Do Right

Creating modpacks with this launcher is super easy: :one: only drag & drop of configs and mods into a folder, :two: ZERO! scary XML/JSON files to edit, and :three: there's a nice interface for creating modpacks (command-line is also available).

The launcher has all standard features that you'd expect like :one: resume of incomplete downloads, :two: incremental updates, and :three: file deduplication (saves disk space when you have files duplicated between updates or modpacks).

LiteLoader, Forge, Fabric, and custom .jar mods are supported. You can put resource packs in, or really even random mod files that don't go in the configs or mods folder.

You do need some sort of website, but it does **not** need anything complicated like PHP.

For those technically inclined, you can generate modpacks from Git (or any VCS) using your favorite continuous integration server, and then dynamically create modpacks even down to one per branch or tag.

Best of all, our launcher is Minecraft's oldest surviving modpack launcher platform. :thumbsup:

## Getting Started

You'll probably need a few hours to get everything working. Fortunately, we have a [detailed wiki](https://github.com/SKCraft/Launcher/wiki) with screenshots for every step, intended for someone with minimal technical experience.

For your evaluation, there are sample files provided that you will be able to upload to your site to see if it even works for you.

## Pretty Pictures

If you are going to create modpacks with our GUI tool, you'll be seeing this beaut:

![Modpack Creator](readme/pack_manager.png)

![Modpack Creator](readme/modpack_creator.png)

![Build Modpacks](readme/packages_generator.png)

Making a modpack is just drag and drop into a folder like this:

* src/**config**/
* src/**mods**/
* src/**resourcepacks**/
* loaders/

LiteLoader and Forge installers, or Fabric Loader, go into the *loaders* folder. :ok_hand:

### More Pictures

There's a dark version of the launcher (personally not the creator's cup of tea) that you can use:

156,gnembon/scarpet,Python,
157,Macuyiko/minecraft-python,Java,"# Minecraft Server Python Interpreter

`minecraft-python` is a Spigot plugin providing the ability to control Minecraft using Python. Contrary to other approaches, this project aims to expose the whole Bukkit API to Python, instead of only providing a few commands by hardcoding or wrapping these in a Spigot plugin.

More background information on how this project came to be can be found on [this blog post](http://blog.macuyiko.com/post/2015/rebuilding-our-jython-console-plugin-for-minecraft.html) (a bit outdated at the moment).

You can watch a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JfwS5hNlw) video showing off some of the possibilities (also a bit outdated by now but gets the idea across).

## Implementation

The implementation is based on Jython. This has the benefit that the complete Python interpreter system runs inside of the JVM, but comes with the drawback that it only supports Python 2.

With the Jython based system, you have the ability to interact with a Jython interpreter through a telnet server, websocket server, and through chat commands (`/py`, `/pyload` and `/pyrestart`). `/py <code>` runs a line of Python code on a Jython interpreter (each player gets their own interpreter instance). A `.` (dot) at the beginning of the `<code>` line can be used in case indentation with whitespace needs to be provided (the Minecraft server removes whitespace so this is provided as a workaround). `/pyrestart` restarts the Jython interpreter. `/pyload <file>` takes a local Python file (in the running directory or on the Desktop of the server) and executes it in the Jython interpreter.

Alternatively, `remote-client.py` can be used to set up a Python REPL that will send commands to the remote Jython interpreter over a websocket connection.

A Telnet client can be used to connect to a telnet-based interface to the remote interpreter.

A built-in Python module, `mcapi.py`, provides some predefined handy commands which can be imported in the remote interpreter. Putting `.py` files in a `python-plugins` directory runs these as ""plugins"" when starting up the plugin. This interpreter keeps running and can be used to set up global hooks. Other interpreters will be cleaned out after some period of inactivity.

### A Word on Python 3

Jython only supports Python 2 for now, and it seems it'll remain that way for a long while longer. There are various Python 3 <-> JVM interop projects available, though none of which seem to offer the ease-of-use of a full Python on JVM implementation as Jython does.

[Py4j](https://www.py4j.org/) comes close, and an earlier commit did provide a way to interact with Minecraft using this library. However, the Py4J implementation relies heavily on callbacks between Python and a JVM, which are sent over the network. Combining this with lots of thread-juggling and Spigot's internal thread model is daunting. The implementation worked, but was very unstable when trying to perform lots of actions on the Spigot server, so I ultimately removed it from the code base for now. See [this commit](https://github.com/Macuyiko/minecraft-python/tree/168656681a2eb8472b9dbd9b00fea276ac4f6f5d) to get an idea where things ended up -- I might add this back in in a separate branch later on.

## Comparison

The explicit goal of this project is to allow programming Minecraft using Python and to provide the full Bukkit API in this environment without resorting to manually wrapping these through a Spigot plugin. Other interesting projects in this space are:

* https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft: modern, Python3-compatible, well-documented library for communication with a MineCraft server. This is on the networking level, however, and rather low-level.
* https://github.com/r1chardj0n3s/pycode-minecraft: similar to command blocks, this plugin allows to code scripts on ""Python Blocks"". Also uses Jython internally.
* http://www.computercraft.info/: an amazing project adding computers and more to Minecraft, provind a coding interface using Lua. This is all in-game, however, comparable to command blocks or `pycode-minecraft`. A fine way to work with computers in Minecraft, though less so to work with Minecraft in computers.
* https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi: combines https://github.com/py3minepi/py3minepi and https://github.com/martinohanlon/minecraft-stuff. Exposes only some basic commands by sending them over the wire to a Minecraft: Pi Edition server. 
* https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice: a plugin that implements the Minecraft Pi Edition API, so that `mcpi` above can be used together with a normal Minecraft server. https://github.com/wensheng/JuicyRaspberryPie extends this a little bit. https://www.nostarch.com/programwithminecraft uses `RaspberryJuice` + `mcpi` to write its examples. A nice approach, with the downside that many ""cool"" Spigot commands are not available (fireworks, spawning, explosions, ...).
* http://scriptcraftjs.org/: similar approach, but uses JavaScript and adds more boilerplate code between the JS engine <-> Java interaction. A bit out of date, sadly.

## Setup

As of its latest version, the plugin is installed just like any other Spigot plugin. **You'll need Java 8 at least.**

On boot, `lib-common` and `python` directories will be created automatically. If you want to access other Minecraft plugins in your Python scripts, their JAR files can be copied over to a `lib-custom` directory.

## Example

Below is a short example of what you can do with the interpreter:

	# Import some modules
	from mcapi import *
	from time import sleep
	from random import randint

	MY_NAME = ""Macuyiko""

	# Note: all code runs asynchronously by default. If you want to make world edits, Spigot
	# forces you to execute these on a synchronised task. Most of the methods included in mcapi
	# will take care of this automatically

	# Set the time to sundawn
	time(0)

	# Zap the point where I'm looking at
	bolt(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)))

	# A small explosion instead
	explosion(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)), power=2)

	# Generate a tree (only works if there is room)
	tree(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)))

	# Spawn some particles
	particle(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)))

	# Spawn an entity (chicken by default)
	spawn(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)))

	# Fireworks
	fireworks(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)))

	# Let's create an exploding chicken spell

	def exploding_chicken(player_name):
	    yell(""Creating an exploding chicken"")
	    chicken = spawn(lookingat(player(player_name)))
	    for i in range(5,0,-1):
	        yell(""%s second(s) left..."" % i)
	        sleep(1)
	    explosion(location(chicken), power=2)
		
		
	# Try it!
	exploding_chicken(MY_NAME)

	# Now let's define a command for this spell
	# Command functions take a special form func(caller, params)

	@asynchronous()
	def cmd_explode_spell(caller, params):
		exploding_chicken(caller.getName())

	# Commands are executed synchronously by Spigot
	# This means that all actions in exploding_chicken would use the state of the 
	# world as it was at the current server tick when executing the command,
	# hence, we use the @asynchronous() decorator to force this function to be 
	# ran asynchronously, only synchronising every time a synchronous command is called

	add_command('chickenspell', cmd_explode_spell)

	# Try typing `/chickenspell` in Minecraft chat window
	# Commands can be unregistered using
	remove_command('chickenspell')

	# Let's register another command to show of the asynchronous workings

	@asynchronous()
	def cmd_growme(caller, params):
	    beginning = lookingat(player(caller.getName()))
	    position = [beginning.x, beginning.y, beginning.z]
	    for i in range(100):
	        setblock(position) # <- will be synchronised
	        position[randint(0,2)] += randint(-1,1)
	        position[1] += +1
	        sleep(0.05)

	add_command('growme', cmd_growme)

	# Now let's register an event
	# These need a func(event) definition

	from org.bukkit.event.block import BlockDamageEvent

	# Almost all events execute synchronised, so again we force them to be asynchronous

	@asynchronous()
	def damage_evt(e):
	    player = e.getPlayer()
	    position = location(player)
	    yell(""I'll count to ten, get out!"")
	    for i in range(10):
	        yell(str(i))
	        sleep(1.0)
	    explosion(position)

	# A block will explode if the player damages it
	listener = add_event_listener(BlockDamageEvent, damage_evt)

	# Remove specific event hook
	remove_event_listener(listener)

	# Or all hooks
	remove_event_listeners()

Plugins works similarly (place this as a `.py` file in a `python-plugins` directory):

	from mcapi import *
	from time import sleep
	from random import randint

	from org.bukkit.event.player import PlayerJoinEvent

	@asynchronous()
	def join_event(e):
	    player = e.getPlayer()
	    player_location = location(player)
	    player_location.y += 20
	    yell(""A chickeny hello to player %s"" % (player.getName(),))
	    for i in range(10):
	        spawn(player_location)

	listener = add_event_listener(PlayerJoinEvent, join_event)

## Aide

Par soucis de temps, nous ne pouvons pas faire de support au cas par cas, mais vous pouvez rejoindre notre serveur [Discord](https://discord.gg/Squeezie) pour trouver de l'aide auprès de la communauté.

### Questions fréquentes

- Que faire en cas de problème d'affichage (votes bloqués au dessus des têtes, etc...) ?  

Cela arrive après avoir `reload` au cours d'une partie, tous les joueurs qui ont ce problème doivent se déconnecter et se reconnecter.

- Pourquoi la partie ne se lance pas ?  

Il faut taper la commande `/lg start <PSEUDO>` en mettant le pseudo d'un des joueurs qui sera présent dans la partie. Si cela ne fonctionne toujours pas, c'est parce qu'il n'y a pas suffisamment de rôles pour le nombre de joueurs, il doit y avoir le même nombre de rôles qu'il y aura de joueurs dans la partie. N'oubliez pas de taper `/lg joinAll` après avoir modifié la liste des rôles.

- J'ai mal placés mes spawns ou je veux utiliser une nouvelle map, comment faire ?  

Il suffit d'ouvrir le fichier `plugins\LoupGarou\config.yml` et de supprimer les points de spawn.

- Puis-je mettre plusieurs fois le même rôle dans une seule partie ?

Cela est possible pour les rôles `Loup-Garou`, `Villageois` et `Chasseur`.
D'autres rôles peuvent aussi marcher mais n'ont pas été testés avec plusieurs joueurs ayant ce rôle dans une seule partie. C'est à vos risques et périls.

- Le tour du loup noir (ou tout autre type de loup garou) ne passe pas.

Il vous faut au minimum un loup garou normal lorsque vous mettez d'autres types de loups dans la partie.

## Indications pour les développeurs

Ce plugin LoupGarou ayant été modifié de nombreuses fois, parfois dans des timings tendus, le code n'est pas très propre. Aussi, il n'est pas documenté.  

Vous devez utiliser `Lombok` et `Maven` pour modifier ce projet. 
Vous devez aussi installer la repository `Spigot` avec [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/).

**Cependant, si l'envie vous prend de modifier ou d'utiliser le code ici présent en partie, ou dans sa totalité, merci de créditer [Leomelki](https://twitter.com/leomelki) et [Shytoos](https://twitter.com/shytoos_).
Une utilisation commerciale est cependant interdite. Merci de vous référer aux informations de [license](#license)**

### Ajouter des rôles

Ce plugin de Loup-Garou est organisé autour d'un système d'événements, disponibles dans le package `fr.leomelki.loupgarou.events`.  
N'ayant pas le temps de les documenter, vous devriez comprendre vous-même quand ils sont appelés.

Pour vous aider à créer des rôles, copiez des rôles ayant déjà été créés pour ainsi les modifier.

⚠️ Ce projet a été créé de façon à ce que les rôles soient (presque) totalement indépendants du reste du code (LGGame, LGPlayer...).  
Merci de garder cela en tête lors du développement de nouveaux rôles : utilisez un maximum les évènements et, s'il en manque, créez-les !

#### Quelques classes utiles
`LGGame` : Contient le coeur du jeu, à modifier le minimum possible !  
`LGPlayer` : Classe utilisée pour intéragir avec les joueurs et stocker leurs données, à modifier le minimum possible !  
`LGVote` : Système gérant les votes.  
`RoleSort`: Classement de l'apparition des rôles durant la nuit. 

### Publier un rôle

Si vous arrivez à créer un rôle, je vous invite à faire une demande de publication dans cette repo afin de les faire partager à l'ensemble de la communauté !

## Welcome to GregTech Community Edition
### What is this?
GregTech Community Edition, or **GTCE**, is a Minecraft mod. The repository contains all the code and assets required to build and run that mod.

### GregTech?
Yes, you have probably heard this name before as it is quite known in the Minecraft modding community. GTCE is an **indirect descendant** and **total rewrite** of _**GregTech**_.  It is **neither created nor maintained by GregoriusT** but was created with his knowledge and permission.

This mod is about **technology** and **progression**.
* From simple crude tools which will allow you to process resources more realistically...
* Through **Steam Age** where early machines will help you save some precious resources and open new possibilities...
* To many **Electric Ages** where increasingly complex machines and logistics will become indispensable parts of your industrial regime.

A typical GregTech facility features large arrays of both single- and multi-block machines processing numerous resources, creating even more complex materials which will be used in machines of higher tiers.

All of which are powered by GTCE's own power systems, featuring generators from simple wood burning for steam to plasma-powered turbines.

### Community Edition?
**Community Edition** is a necessary part of the **GTCE name**: 
* It is required by our permission to use the GregTech name
* It is a reminder that the ideas and design are primarily driven by the community
* It is a reminder that the implementation and work are solely provided by the community.

Of course, this does not mean that everyone can add whatever content they want.  But it does mean that the primary maintainers want to listen to the community and take suggestions and ideas to heart when planning or working on any projects.

### Project Goal
To bring preferred GregTech concepts and ideas from GT (Minecraft 1.7.10 versions and earlier) to Minecraft 1.12, targetting a feature-rich, UX-friendly and comprehensive play-through while streamlining and eliminating bloat and make-work details.

Gregtech 5 Unofficial was used as an original base, with some ideas from GT4 and GT6 also incorporated. Many community suggestions have been since applied.

We work with our addon-partners to attempt to preserve backwards-compatibility.

### Release cycle
GTCE follows a two week release cycle (when possible). 
Changelogs are generated and beautified after merging PRs every other Monday. Changelog is then submitted as a Pull Request (PR).
Releases are built and deployed on Tuesdays after merging the Changelog PR.

## Contribution
### Current state of project
GTCE is under active development with regular updates. It is primarily maintained by a ""GTCE Council"" of contributors of various talent: developers, designers and modpack authors. This council is coordinated by @LAGIdiot. The GTCE community is very active and regularly contributes code, testing and ideas.
We are always looking for contributors!

### How to contribute
Remember: Every contribution counts. 
Found a bug? Please let us know by creating an Issue with the bug template. 
Something is missing? Thought about a cool feature idea? Of course there's a template for that.  We'll have a look!
Know how to mod or at least code? Then don't hesitate and jump to Discord channel, contact the Maintainer to discuss possible contribution.
Anything else? Sure come to Discord.

### [教程 · Tutorial](https://go-mc.github.io/tutorial/)

Require Go version: 1.19

There's some library in Go support you to create your Minecraft client or server.  
这是一些Golang库，用于帮助你编写自己的Minecraft客户端或服务器。

- [x] 👍 Minecraft network protocol
- [x] 👍 Robot framework
- [x] 👍 Server framework
- [x] 👍 Dual role RCON protocol (Server & Client)
- [x] 👍 Chat Message (Support both Json and old `§` format)
- [x] 👍 NBT (Based on reflection)
- [x] 👌 SNBT ⇋ NBT
- [x] 👍 Regions & Chunks & Blocks
- [x] ⌛ Yggdrasil (Mojang login)
- [x] ⌛ Realms Server

> We don't promise that API is 100% backward compatible.

## Getting start 

Go-MC tag the old version after new version released. For example, 
if *1.19.3* is the latest Minecraft version, the newest go-mc tag will be *v1.19.2*.
To get the latest Go-MC that support *1.19.3*, usually you must use `go get -u github.com/Tnze/go-mc@master`.
Special cases are version like *1.19*, the Go-MC support it is tagged `v1.19.0` to avoid automatically upgrade. 

Examples:  
To get the latest version: `go get github.com/Tnze/go-mc@master`  
To get old versions (e.g. 1.18.2): `go get github.com/Tnze/go-mc@v1.18.2`
To get the first of each primary version: `go get github.com/Tnze/go-mc@v1.19.0`

### Run Examples

- Run `go run github.com/Tnze/go-mc/cmd/mcping localhost` to ping and list the localhost mc server.
- Run `go run github.com/Tnze/go-mc/cmd/daze` to join the local server at *localhost:25565* as player named Daze on the offline mode.

## Supported Version

As the `go-mc/net` package implements the minecraft network protocol, there is no update between the versions at this
level. So net package actually supports any version. It's just that the ID and content of the package are different
between different versions.

由于`go-mc/net`实现的是MC底层的网络协议，而这个协议在MC更新时其实并不会有改动，MC更新时其实只是包的ID和内容的定义发生了变化，所以net包本身是跨版本的。

162,FabricMC/yarn,Java,"# Yarn

Yarn is a set of open, unencumbered Minecraft mappings, free for everyone to use under the Creative Commons Zero license. The intention is to let 
everyone mod Minecraft freely and openly, while also being able to innovate and process the mappings as they see fit.

To see the current version being targeted, check the branch name!

## Usage
To use yarn-deobfuscated Minecraft for Minecraft modding or as a dependency in a Java project, you can use [loom](https://github.com/fabricmc/fabric-loom) Gradle plugin. See [fabric wiki tutorial](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) for more information.

To obtain a deobfuscated Minecraft jar, [`./gradlew mapNamedJar`](#mapNamedJar) will generate a jar named like `<minecraft version>-named.jar`, which can be sent to a decompiler for deobfuscated code.

Please note to run the yarn build script **Java 16** or higher is required!

## Contributing

Please remember that copying and pasting mappings from alternate projects under more restrictive licenses (such as MCP, Spigot's or Mojang's obfuscation maps)
is **completely forbidden** without explicit permission from the owners of said mappings to distribute the names under the CC0 license.
This includes using the names from those mappings for inspiration. Discussing the naming approaches used in said projects
is also not welcome - you have been warned. However, it is a good idea to consult name changes with other people - use pull requests or our community spaces to ask questions!

Please have a look at the [naming conventions](/CONVENTIONS.md) before submitting mappings.

### Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run `./gradlew yarn` (Linux, macOS) or `gradlew yarn` (Windows) to open [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma), a user interface to easily edit the mappings
3. Commit and push your work to your fork
4. Open a pull request with your changes

## Gradle
Yarn uses Gradle to provide a number of utility tasks for working with the mappings.

### `yarn`
Setup and download and launch the latest version of [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma) automatically configured to use the merged jar and the mappings.

Compared to launching Enigma externally, the gradle task adds a name guesser plugin that automatically maps enums and a few constant field names.

### `yarnUnpicked`
Same as above, but unpicks the constants and launches Enigma with them. Can be a little bit slower to get going.

### `yarnCommon`
Same as `yarn`, but will only show common classes.

### `build`
Build a GZip'd archive containing a tiny mapping between official (obfuscated), [intermediary](https://github.com/FabricMC/intermediary), and yarn names (""named"") and packages enigma mappings into a zip archive..

### `mapNamedJar`
Builds a deobfuscated jar with yarn mappings and automapped fields (enums, etc.). Unmapped names will be filled with [intermediary](https://github.com/FabricMC/Intermediary) names.

### `decompileCFR`
Decompile the mapped source code. **Note:** This is not designed to be recompiled.

### `download`
Downloads the client and server Minecraft jars for the current Minecraft version to `.gradle/minecraft`

### `mergeJars`
Merges the client and server jars into one merged jar, located at `VERSION-merged.jar` in the mappings directory where `VERSION` is the current Minecraft version.

163,Footsiefat/Minecraft-Server-Scanner,Python,"# Minecraft-Server-Scanner
Let's you scan the entire internet in a couple of hours and identify all Minecraft servers on IPV4


**Installation:**
```
sudo apt install masscan (Or distro specific installer command)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/master/data/exclude.conf
pip3 install mcstatus
```

**start scanning for servers:**
```
sudo masscan -p25565 0.0.0.0/0 --max-rate <maxrate> --excludefile exclude.conf -oL masscan.txt (Set maxrate to a limit that you are comfortable with and won't melt your router)
```

**find real minecraft servers from the results of the scan:**
```
python mcscanner.py -i masscan.txt -o result.txt -p public.txt
```

###### for more infomation you can always get help by typing ```python mcscanner.py -h```

- For filtering out public servers you can use my public.txt file but it will probably be a bit outdated by now
- Hit enter and wait for my program to check and grab the metadata for all the servers found, once this is done you will have a massive amount of servers (A lot of them being private ones) to have some fun with. The output file includes the IP Address, Version and Current Players online of found servers.

===========

What is this?
-------------

An upcoming mod for Minecraft, based on adding new and fun ways to generate power through big multi-block structures. Don't just plop blocks, design the machines yourself!

For near-future plans and development status, see the Roadmap file.

Big Reactors has an official website at [www.big-reactors.com](http://www.big-reactors.com)

Alpha
--------

Big Reactors is in an alpha state. The major features exist, and there are no _known_ serious bugs. However, it's not fully balanced. I'm only one guy - I can't totally break all the combinations you crazy folks will discover. The internal radiation/power production simulation is very complicated.

You can download the latest alpha from [the big-reactors.com download page](http://www.big-reactors.com/#/download).

_You will need other mods_ to play with Big Reactors. This is just a power-generation mod, so you will need a mod that supports the Redstone Flux (RF) power system. I personally recommend [Thermal Expansion](http://teamcofh.com/thermal-expansion).

License
-------

Licensing for Minecraft mods is silly. If you want to use my mod on your server, in your modpack, whatever, do it, have fun! If you want to use, copy or fork my code, go for it, have fun!

## Contributing

### Clone Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine. Use the link of either your fork or the main repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/lambda-client/lambda
```

Run `setupWorkspace.sh` to initialize the environment.
Use your terminal on Linux or [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for Windows.
```
./setupWorkspace.sh
```

### Setup IDE

In this guide we will use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as our IDE.
1. Open the project from `File > Open...`
2. Let the IDE collect dependencies and index the code.
3. Goto `File > Project Structure... > SDKs` and make sure an SDK for Java 8 is installed and selected, if not download
   one [here](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot/).

### Gradle build

Test if the environment is set up correctly by building the client and running it inside the IDE using the Gradle tab on the right side of the IDE.
1. Go to `lambda > Tasks > build > runClient` in the Gradle tab and run the client.
2. To build the client as a jar run `lambda > Tasks > build > build`. Gradle will create a new directory called `build`. The final built jar will be in `build/libs`.

Minecraft:Bedrock Edition Unicode characters

## How to use
Copy the unicode character and paste it into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition chats, signs, titles etc.

## How does it work?
Minecraft uses resource packs to assign characters (glyphs) to different unicode values, which is how the game allows you to type in chat and write on signs etc. Because fonts are just textures in a resource pack, it also allows the game to add ""emojis"" which have their own unicode values assign to them just like letters.

"
173,hexparrot/mineos-node,JavaScript,"Node.JS MineOS
======

MineOS is a server front-end to ease managing Minecraft administrative tasks.
This iteration using Node.js aims to enhance previous MineOS scripts (Python-based),
by leveraging the event-triggering, asyncronous model of Node.JS and websockets.

This allows the front-end to provide system health, disk and memory usage, and logging in real-time.

This has been tested on Debian, Ubuntu, ArchLinux, and FreeBSD and should work on all variants, Linux or BSD.

Installation
------------

MineOS is distributed through github and downloads its dependencies with npm.

MineOS requires root-privileges, as the authentication relies on the underlying system's /etc/shadow.

Do not install this atop an existing MineOS system (using the Python-based webui), since the installation location is the same /usr/games/minecraft. Following are steps for installing MineOS on an apt-get based distribution, such as Debian or Ubuntu.  These instructions are detailed further (as well as for additional distributions) on the [MineOS wiki](https://minecraft.codeemo.com/mineoswiki/index.php?title=Installing_MineOS).

Using an apt-get based Linux distribution:

    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | bash -
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y nodejs git rdiff-backup screen build-essential openjdk-8-jre-headless
    mkdir -p /usr/games
    cd /usr/games
    git clone https://github.com/hexparrot/mineos-node.git minecraft
    cd minecraft
    chmod +x generate-sslcert.sh
    ./generate-sslcert.sh
    cp mineos.conf /etc/mineos.conf
    npm install
    
For hosts using 'upstart':

    cp /usr/games/minecraft/init/upstart_conf /etc/init/mineos.conf
    start mineos

For hosts using 'supervisor':

    cp /usr/games/minecraft/init/supervisor_conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/mineos.conf
    supervisorctl reread
    supervisorctl update
    supervisorctl start mineos

For hosts using 'systemd':

    cp /usr/games/minecraft/init/systemd_conf /etc/systemd/system/mineos.service
    systemctl enable mineos
    systemctl start mineos

To use the webui as a background daemon:

    node service.js [start|stop|restart|status]

To start the webui in the foreground:

    node webui.js

Things to watch out for
------

On FreeBSD, you will need to mount a Linux-compatible /proc filesystem, i.e., linprocfs,
at /usr/compat/linux/proc in order for the web-ui to work. In addition, where CLANG is
default for your system, you'll need to build the NPM modules differently:

    echo ""CXX=c++ npm install"" | sh

Mineos-node requires rsync 3.1.x or later, 3.0.x does not have the ability to chown
on copy, which is essential for profiles. Depending on your distribution, you may need
to build it from source.

Developing and Contributing
------

I'd love to get contributions from you! Whether you are most comfortable writing
HTML, CSS, or Javascript (either Nodejs or Angular), feel free to reach out to me about
some of my design goals and we'll see where your efforts can best be used.

CURRENTLY WORKING
-------

The Angular.JS-based web user interface capable of:

* creating and deleting servers, 
* starting, restarting, killing and stopping servers 
* backup, archive, wait-for-stop-and-backup
* reading ingame console in real-time and submitting commands
* create cronjobs for the most common tasks
* adding and modifying server.properties
* delete previous archives and restore poitns to free up space
* restore server from previous restore point
* see filesystem usage of live server files, archives, and restore points
* authentication via shadow passwords (/etc/shadow) of underlying Linux system
* logs all user actions to file
* cronjobs saved to portable format cron.config
* server can be daemonized to background
* upstart/supervisord restart process on unhandled exceptions
* easy selection of server packs from FTB or Mojang official jars
* PHAR support for Pocketmine servers
* Support for BungeeCord servers
* command-line interface for scripting

TODO
-------

* macro often-repeated tasks from web-ui
* more fully document functions

EVENTUALLY
-------

* implement previous_versions: functionality to roll back or view particular files' previous state
* identify java versions in web-ui, allow choice of utilized jvm

# Thicc Industries Backdoor

A silent, spreading backdoor for Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers.
Using the injector is recommended, should you choose to manually backdoor a plugin, you're on your own if you run into problems.

For educational purposes only. Do not use on a server you do not own.

Read in [Turkish](README.tr.md)

## Requirements:
* Java 8 runtime.
* Desired target plugin jar file.

## GUI Usage:
* Run backdoor-(version).jar.
* Select desired plugin file.
* Input your Minecraft UUID.
* Input chat command prefix. (Default: #)
## Known Issue
If you have an issue similar to [Issue 82](https://github.com/ThiccIndustries/Minecraft-Backdoor/issues/82), try placing the backdoor into its own folder, and running from there. Do not try to run from the Start Menu.
## CLI Usage:
Java -jar backdoor.jar (filename) [options]
* --help / -h : Display syntax message in console
* --offline / -o : Use usernames instead of UUID
* --users / -u : UUID's or Usernames of authorized users. If not used, all users will be allowed.
* --prefix / -p (Default: '#') : Prefix for backdoor commands.
* --discord /-d : Discord webhook url. See Readme.
* --spread / -s : Spread to other plugins.
* --debug / -b : Send debug messages in console. Use this before creating issue reports.

## Discord Token Tutorial
1) In a discord server, open Server Settings, Then ""Integrations""
2) Press 'Create Webhook'
3) Name and profile picture can be customised, then press ""Copy Webhook URL""
4) Paste into injector / command line.

## Commands
Default command prefix is ``#``,  this can be changed.
* #help - display all command, or description of command

176,mtoensing/Docker-Minecraft-PaperMC-Server,Dockerfile,"# Docker Minecraft JAVA PaperMC Server 1.19

Docker Minecraft PaperMC server for 1.19, 1.18, 1.17 for AMD64 and ARM64 platforms. Works on Synology, Raspberry Pi 4 or any other systems that support docker.

[![Build and push](https://github.com/mtoensing/Docker-Minecraft-PaperMC-Server/actions/workflows/dockerimage.yml/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/mtoensing/Docker-Minecraft-PaperMC-Server/actions/workflows/dockerimage.yml)

## Quick Start

```sh
docker run --rm --name mcserver -e MEMORYSIZE='1G' -v /home/joe/mcserver:/data:rw -p 25565:25565 -i marctv/minecraft-papermc-server:latest
```
The server will generate all data including the world and config files in ``/home/joe/mcserver``. Change that to an existing folder.

## How do I update the container? 

### On Synology DSM

* Re-download the image from the docker repository.
* Stop the container.
* Clear the container.
* Start the container.

### On Terminal

```sh
docker pull marctv/minecraft-papermc-server:latest
docker stop mcserver
```

Or just use https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/ 

## Run as non-root user

You can get the desired UID/GID (xxx) with the ID command (id username) then add the following to your docker run command:

```sh
-e PUID=xxx
-e PGID=xxx
```

## Docker Compose

If you prefer to use `docker-compose`, use the following commands:

Start the server:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
Stop the server:
```sh
docker-compose stop
```
Issue server commands after attaching to the container:
```sh
docker attach mcserver
# then you can type things like ""list""
list
# which will show the current players online or
help
# to see all the commands available
```

## How to use the Makefile with Docker Compose 

Additionally, a `Makefile` is provided to easily start, stop, and attach to the container.

```sh
make start     # equivalent to `docker-compose up -d --build`
make stop      # equivalent to `docker-compose stop --rmi all --remove-orphans`
make attach    # equivalent to `docker attach mcserver`
make help      # prints a help message
```

## Environment variables

MEMORYSIZE = 1G

Not more than 70% of your RAM for your container. This is important. Because this is the RAM, your Minecraft Server will use within the container WITHOUT the operating system.

TZ = Europe/Berlin 

Sets the timezone for the container. A list of valid values can be found on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

PAPERMC_FLAGS = --nojline

Sets the command-line flags for PaperMC. Remove `--nojline` if you want to enable color and tab-completion for the server console.

### How-to install on a Raspberry Pi 4

You can install this docker container by using my dedicated installer: https://github.com/mtoensing/RaspberryPiMinecraftDocker Or just follow these steps:

1. Download **Raspberry Pi Imager** https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ and start it.
2. Select Raspberry Pi OS **lite** (64-bit) under ""Raspberry Pi OS (other)"".
3. Click on gear icon in the Raspberry Pi Imager and enable ssh and set username and password.
4. Write image to a fast sd card. 
5. Connect the Raspberry Pi 4 to an ethernet cable.
6. Use putty for Windows or terminal on macOS and connect via ssh:
```sh
ssh pi@raspberrypi
```
7. Upgrade all packages 
```sh
 sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
 sudo reboot now
```
The Raspberry Pi will restart now.

8. Install Docker 
```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
chmod +x get-docker.sh 
./get-docker.sh 
sudo apt-get install -y uidmap
dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo systemctl enable docker
newgrp docker
```
9. New folder for the server
```sh
cd 
mkdir mcserver
```
10. Run this image as Minecraft Server
```sh
docker run -d \
--restart unless-stopped \
--name mcserver \
-e MEMORYSIZE='1G' \
-e PAPERMC_FLAGS='' \
-v /home/pi/mcserver:/data:rw \
-p 25565:25565 \
-it marctv/minecraft-papermc-server:latest
```
The server will generate all data including the world and config files in ``/home/pi/mcserver``.

11. Enter the command line of Minecraft server
```sh
docker attach mcserver
```
Here, you can use Minecraft server commands like ``whitelist add [userrname]``.

177,udoprog/c10t,C++,"c10t - a cartography tool for Minecraft
=======================================

I wrote c10t entirely because i liked the tool Cartograph by ZomBuster, but I wasn't too fond of a couple of aspects about how rendering was performed.

Requirements
------------

  * libz (?)
  * libpng (>= 1.2)
  * libfreetype (>= 2)
  * libboost (thread, filesystem, system and test) (>= 1.46)

Features
--------

  * Pipelined rendering process (using image compositioning) which allows for
    multithreaded rendering.
  * Very memory friendly, you can specify a memory limit and it will switch caching to file.
  * Uses proper command line options.
  * Clean code, for easing further development.
  * Multiplatform - yes, it does compile properly on windows and mac.
  * A gui wrapper, see: http://github.com/udoprog/c10t-swt (native gui with java bindings)

I would not have done this were it not for the excellent inspiration by
ZomBuster and Firemark (the linux port of cartograph). Thank you for the
inspiration.

Building from Source (using cmake)
----------------------------------

### Ubuntu ###

 1. Install dependencies:

        $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libpng-dev zlib1g-dev libboost-all-dev libfreetype6-dev

    If libboost >= 1.46 is not available by using your package manager, you need to install it from source. To do so download and untar it from www.boost.org and perform the following operations as root:

        $ ./bootstrap --prefix=/usr
        $ ./b2 install

    If you have troubles installing boost, consult the Getting Started Guide on the website of the boost library.

 2. Clone repository

        $ git clone git://github.com/udoprog/c10t.git
        $ cd c10t

    You need to clone the repository in order to successfully execute the commands in step three. You can get support for git on the following web page:
    http://schacon.github.com/git/gittutorial.html
    Just scroll to the section ""Using git for collaboration"".

 3. Update submodules which contains some required dependencies (./libs):

        $ git submodule init
        $ git submodule update

 4. Run:

        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake ..
        $ make c10t

 * CMake should generate a file called src/config.h from the input file src/config.h.cmake
  
 * There are several targets you can make.  c10t, c10t-lib, c10t-debug, and c10t-test.
   * If you wish to build all of these simply run `make` which defaults to target `all`.
   * If you wish to build any individual one run `make <target>` e.g. `make c10t-test`.

4. The executable `c10t` should be in the current directory.

There are a couple of available targets

 * ___c10t-debug___ - debug build with symbols, nice for debugging
 * ___c10t-lib___ - library that contains all c10t functions not in main or nbt_inspect
 * ___nbt-inspect___ - dumps the content of an nbt data file (basically anything in the world directory). Useful for writing tools.
 * ___region-inspect___ - dumps the content of a mcr region file.

Issues
------

 * Issues should be posted on http://github.com/udoprog/c10t/issues
 * Run the program in debug mode (c10t --debug), this will print useful information, but be much slower.
 * ALWAYS include `c10t --version` information when posting issues, that way it can be determined weither the issue already has been resolved or not, if this information is missing, the issue probably cannot be resolved.
 * ALWAYS include the following information: Platform (e.g. Windows, Linux, Mac) and Architecture (x86, x86_64)
 * IF POSSIBLE include information which can help us reproduce the problem.

179,fnuecke/oc2,Java,"# OpenComputers II

OpenComputers II is a Minecraft mod adding virtual computers to the game. These computers run a virtual machine emulating a 64-Bit RISC-V architecture capable of booting Linux. On top of this, a high-level Lua API is provided to communicate with various devices in the game world. This enables adding virtual devices using a simple, Java-friendly API, without having to implement actual kernel drivers.

This mod is a successor to [OpenComputers]. At least in spirit. While many of the implementation details have changed quite dramatically, the core concepts of customizable hardware, persistence and sand-boxing are shared.

## Gameplay Documentation
For documentation on how the to get computers up and running, and how to use them, see the [documentation]. It is available as a manual item in the game.

## Development Documentation
While the mod isn't quite yet ready for release due to some remaining technical and usability issues, the API should be mostly stable at this point. For most people the high level device API will be sufficient, and is much more accessible. It centers around the [`RPCDevice`][RPC Device]. For a sample block implementation, see the [redstone interface]. For a sample item implementation, see the [sound card]. If you wish to dive deeper, and provide emulated hardware that requires a Linux driver, this centers around the [`VMDevice`][VM Device]. For a sample block implementation, see the [disk drive]. For a sample item implementation, see the [network card].

## Building
To build this project, credentials for the Github Package Repository must be set up once on your machine (see
[the documentation][GithubPackagesGradle] for more information). In short, you'll want to add your username and a
public access token with `read:packages` permissions into your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`. The properties must be
named `gpr.user` and `gpr.key`.

[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/mide/minecraft-overviewer.svg)](https://github.com/mide/minecraft-overviewer/issues)

Docker Image to Run [Minecraft Overviewer](https://overviewer.org/). Overviewer is a render that produces a render of a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en/) world. The goal of this image is to easily run the Overviewer project without having to worry about dependencies, and to provide sane default configurations.

:warning: **This project is not official nor affiliated with the wonderful [Minecraft Overviewer](https://overviewer.org/) project**.

This project's code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mide/minecraft-overviewer), and the resulting Docker image is hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mide/minecraft-overviewer). Feel free to open [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mide/minecraft-overviewer/issues?q=is%3Aopen) if you're having problems.

## Running Minecraft Overviewer

```shell
docker pull mide/minecraft-overviewer:latest
docker run \
  --rm \
  -e MINECRAFT_VERSION=""1.17"" \
  -v /home/user/minecraft/:/home/minecraft/server/:ro \
  -v /srv/http/minecraft/:/home/minecraft/render/:rw \
  mide/minecraft-overviewer:latest
```

_Note:_ The `latest` Docker tag is rebuilt daily. If there are changes to the [upstream project](https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer/), it may take up to 24 hours for the new image to contain them.

## Environment Variables

### Required

- `MINECRAFT_VERSION`
  Set to the version of Minecraft the world is based from (Like `1.17`). Used for textures. You can also use the special version `latest` or `latest_snapshot` to just use the latest version (stable or snapshot, respectively).

### Optional

- `ADDITIONAL_ARGS`
  Default Value: _null_. Set to contain any additional arguments you'd like to pass into `overviewer.py`.

- `ADDITIONAL_ARGS_POI`
  Default Value: _null_. Set to contain any additional arguments you'd like to pass into `overviewer.py --genpoi`.

- `CONFIG_LOCATION`
  Default Value: `/home/minecraft/config.py`. Set to a different path to override the provided configuration. This only makes sense if you have a different configuration in a volume.

- `RENDER_MAP`
  Default Value: `true`. Set to `false` if you do not want to render the map. This is useful for POI only-updates.

- `RENDER_POI`
  Default Value: `true`. Set to `false` to disable rendering of POI (points of interest).

- `RENDER_SIGNS_FILTER`
  Default Value: `-- RENDER --`. Only signs with this case-sensitive string will be included in the POI (points of interest) render. Useful for allowing hidden bases or decluttering the render. Set to an empty string (`""""`) to render all signs.

- `RENDER_SIGNS_HIDE_FILTER`
  Default Value: `false`. Set to `true` to prevent the sign filter string (Set via `RENDER_SIGNS_FILTER`) from appearing in the render. For example, if only signs with `-- RENDER --` are displayed, the string `-- RENDER --` would be hidden from the render.

- `RENDER_SIGNS_JOINER`
  Default Value: `<br />`. Set to the string that should be used to join the lines on the sign while rendering. Value of `""<br />""` will make each in-game line it's own line on the render. A value of `"" ""` will make all the in-game lines a single line on the render.

steps: 
1. Create a repo on github and clone it onto your computer.
2. Download the .zip file and extract the contents into the local repo folder.
3. Create a ngrok account on https://ngrok.com and paste the auth token in .ngrok2/ngrok.yml
4. Commit and push.
5. Create a heroku account on https://heroku.com and create an app. In the ""Deploy"" tab, connect to github and your repo.
6. Go to the ""Settings"" tab, click on ""add buildpack"", and add the following: node.js, PHP, python, Java, and paste ""https://github.com/jkutner/heroku-buildpack-ngrok.git"" (without the quotation marks ofc) into the buildpack url.
7. Go to the ""Resouces"" tab, and in the ""add-ons"" section, add Heroku Postgres.
8. Head back on to the ""Deploy"" section, scroll down to the Manual Deploy section, and click ""Deploy Branch"". 
9. After the app deploys, head to the ""Resources"" tab and disable the ""web python3 main.py"" and enable ""worker node setup.js"".
10. Deploy the app again. click on the ""more"" and then ""view logs"".
11. Once you see ""script: uploaded to db"", head back to ""Resources"" and enable ""web python3 main.py"" and disable ""worker node setup.js"".
12. Deploy again to start the server. In the logs, you will see ""script: started ngrok tcp"" when the server is ready. Click on ""open app"" and copy the first tunnel url(without the tcp://). x.ngrok.io.xxx will be the IP.
13. To modify the world, you will have to manually delete the current world, launch the server locally to generate a new world, zip it, and upload to GitHub. Repeat steps 9 to 12 to set up the new world.
14. To modify the server, directly change the server.properties on GitHub.

There is currently no way of accessing the server console, so you will have to execute them from the Minecraft Client.

Video instructions: https://youtu.be/EBzkSDBmaoU

If you want to use another server thats not vanilla or spigot, the process would be the same: rename the server to server.jar, run it locally to set it up, and then push and deploy.

`(command) (required param) (optional param)`

### Browse tags ###


You can browse nbt tree structure using this command:  
`/nbt (object) (query) (view-mode)`

**object** - Object that contains NBT tag.  
Examples:  
`/nbt inventory` - show items in your inventory as nbt list  
`/nbt block` - show nbt of target block  
`/nbt item` - show nbt tag of item in hand

Examples:  
`/nbt $playerFile = *playerName` - save all tags of playerName to file playerFile.nbt  
`/nbt me HealF = $playerFile HealF` - set value of your health to stored in playerFile.nbt in tag ""HealF""  

#### Move value (cut and paste): ####
`/nbt object1 query1 >> object2 query2`  
`/nbt object2 query2 << object1 query1`  
Value will be removed from object1 and set to object2

#### Swap values: ####
`/nbt object1 query1 <> object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 swap object2 query2`  
Values of the objects will be swapped  
Example:  
`/nbt block Items <> me Inventory` - swap your inventory with targeted chest  

#### Add value: ####
`/nbt object1 query1 add value`  
`/nbt object1 query1 add object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 += value`  
`/nbt object1 query1 += object2 query2`  
Add value to object1

Behavior is different for the following cases:  
Object1 is number, value is number - increace number  
Object1 is string - concatenate  
Object1 is list or array, value is list or array - add all items from value to object  
Object is compound and value is compound - add all entries from value to object  
Examples:  
`/nbt me HealF += 2` - Increace your hp by 2   
`/nbt me HealF += -2` - Decreace your hp by 2   
`/nbt item display.Name += ""(tool)""` - add text to item name  

#### Insert value to special position ####
`/nbt object1 query1 insert position value type`  
`/nbt object1 query1 ins position value type`  
`/nbt object1 query1 insert position object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 ins position object2 query2`  
Insert value to object to special position Object1 must be an list or array.  
Example:  

before: item display.Lore = `[""Lore1"",""Lore2"",""Lore3"",""Lore4""]`  
`/nbt item display.Lore insert 2 ""New Lore""` - insert ""New lore"" to position 2 in list  
after: item display.Lore = `[""Lore1"",""Lore2"",""New Lore"",""Lore3"",""Lore4""]`  

#### Bitwise operations ####
`/nbt object1 query1 &= object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 |= object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 ^= object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 &= value type`  
`/nbt object1 query1 |= value type`  
`/nbt object1 query1 ^= value type`  
`/nbt object1 query1 inverse`  
`/nbt object1 query1 inv`  
`/nbt object1 query1 ~`

`&=` - bitwise AND  
`|=` - bitwise OR  
`|=` - bitwise XOR  
`~` - bitwise NOT  
Examples:  
`/nbt item HideFlags |= b0000100` - hide ""Unbreakable"" display property in item  
`/nbt item HideFlags &= b1111110` - show ""ench"" display property in item  
`/nbt item HideFlags ^= b0000010` - toggle ""AttributeModifiers"" display property in item  

#### Multiplication ####
`/nbt object1 query1 *= object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 *= value type`  
Multiply left value to right value.  
All values must be a numbers

#### Rename tags ####

`/nbt object query1 rename newName`  
`/nbt object query1 ren newName`  
Rename tag in compound to newName

#### Remove tags ####

`/nbt object query remove`  
`/nbt object query rem`  
If query is not present, it will attempt to remove object  
Examples:  
`/nbt item display remove` - remove all display attributes of item  
`/nbt $filename remove` - remove file filename.nbt  
`/nbt id12345 remove` - remove entity with id=12345  

#### Buffer ####

###### Copy value to buffer ######
`/nbt object query copy`  
`/nbt value type copy`  

###### Cut value to buffer ######
`/nbt object query cut`  

###### Paste value from buffer ######
`/nbt object query paste`  

Example:  
`/nbt me Inventory copy` - copy your inventory to buffer (clipboard)  
`/nbt buffer [0].tag.display.Name = ""new Name of item""` - change value in buffer  
`/nbt me Inventory paste` - paste buffer back to your inventory  

#### Variables ####

###### Set variable ###### 

`/nbt %variable set object query`  
`/nbt %variable set value type`  
`/nbt object query as %variable`  
`/nbt value type as %variable`  
After this command you can use a variable as if using the object  
**%variable** - Name of variable  

###### Get variable ######
`/nbt %variable`

###### Remove variable ######
`/nbt %variable remove`

Example:  
`/nbt %b set block` - set block as variable %b  
`/nbt block as %b` - set block as variable %b  
`/nbt %b Items` - Now you can use a variable %b as if you are using a block  

#### Spawn entities ####

`/nbt object [query] spawn world`  
`/nbt mojangsonValue spawn world`  
**world** (optional) - World where spawn entity. Required for executing from console.  
Required tags in left side to spawn entity:  
**id** - entity Savegame ID   
**Pos** - position of entity. List of doubles  

Examples:  
`/nbt {id:pig,Pos:[1d,100d,2d],Riding:{id:MinecartRideable}} spawn world1` - spawn pig in minecart at position `1:100:2` in world world1  
`/nbt id123(Creeper) copy` - copy entity value to buffer  
`/nbt buffer Pos = me Pos` - change position stored in buffer to your position  
`/nbt buffer spawn` - spawn entity at your position  

#### Debug mode ####

Enable or disable debug mode:
`/nbt debug on`
`/nbt debug off`

#### Object ####

Object is special container that can contains nbt tag.
Plugin can read tags from it, save, and remove container.
You can use these objects:

* `me` - you =) as player  
* `item`, `i` - item in hand (only tagged items)  
* `block`, `b` - block at the line of sight  
* `chunk` - chunk in player's position (disabled in 1.17+)

* `chunk:x:z:world` - chunk at position x:z in world (disabled in 1.17+)  
* `buffer`, `c` - your buffer  
* `*name` - online player.  
* `@nаme` - offline player's .dat file.   
* `%variable` - defined variable. Example: `%skeleton`  
* `inventory`, `inv` - your inventory. (alias for ""me Inventory"")  
* `hand`, `h` - Selected slot in your inventory. (alias for ""me Inventory[n]"")  
* `hand:рlayer`, `h:рlayer` - Selected slot in inventory of player.  
* `$name` - file name.nbt in folder plugins/PowerNBT/nbt/  
* `$$name` - compressed file name.nbtz in folder plugins/PowerNBT/nbt/  
* `file:filename` - file in minecraft folder.  
filename can be enclosed in quotes: file:""plugins/myplugin/file.dat""

Examples:  
`/nbt item display.Lore[2] = this display.Name`  
`/nbt me Inventory = this EnderItems`  
* `*` - future object.  
after this command you must select any block or entity or input new value to chat  

#### Query ####

Query allows you to browse and select special tag in object.  
Query is string containing tags, sepatated by `.`    
Examples:  
`Inventory[1].id` - id of second item in player inventory  
`display.Name` - item's name.  
`pages[0]` - first page of book  
`.` - root  

Tag name can contains spaces and unicode characters.  
In this case, enter the tag name in quotes:  
`forgeData.""foo bar""[0]`  
`forgeData.""unicode\u2600"".tag`  
`forgeData.example.""multi\nline""`  

###### JSON query: `#` ######
`display.Name#` - select string display.Name as JSON  
`display.Name#text` - select ""text"" property of JSON  
Example:  
`/nbt item display.Name#text = ""name""`  
`/nbt item display.Name`  {""text"":""name""}  

###### Range query: `[A..B]` ######
Select subarray or substring.  
`[1..3]` - select items from 1 to 3  
`[1..]` - select items from 1 to end  
`[3..1]` - select items from 1 to 3 in reversed order

last char:  
`b` -> byte[] array  
`i` -> int[] array  
`l` -> long[] array
Example:  
`/nbt buffer myByteArray = [1,2,3,10]b`  

###### json / mojangson ######
Create nbt object from string in mojangson format  
Spaces in tag names are not allowed.  
Types can be used: `json`, `mojangson` (default)  
Example:  
`/nbt item = {display:{Name:""New item name""}}`

`/nbt * Fire = 1000` - waiting for future object  
=> select entity by right-click  
and selected entity begins to burn  

Example, set variable:  
`/nbt %var select` - waiting for future object  
=> select entity or block by right-click  
and selected object is stored in variable %var

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/clj-minecraft/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/clj-minecraft/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/clj-minecraft/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

cljminecraft has two specific goals:

**Open up support for other clojure plugins on Bukkit**
> The first objective is accomplished within the ClojurePlugin.java
> class and the cljminecraft.core namespace. It will take care of
> calling the [plugin].core/start function, passing in the Bukkit plugin
> object for local plugin state handling.

**Provide convenience functions to make writing plugins more idiomatic to clojure**
> The second objective is accomplished by the various other namespaces
> in clj-minecraft. I'm keeping the structure fairly flat and concise so
> that one can write idiomatic code for 80% of the plugin code.

## Usage

### Install the mod

Download the latest server mod build from http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/cljminecraft/files/ or build it yourself by cloning the repo and `lein uberjar`

Copy the jar into the Bukkit plugin folder and fire up your server. Once started, it should have opened a REPL port, by default on port 4005

If all you wanted was to enable clojure plugins on your server, you're done. If you want to write some code, read on.

### Write some code

From now on, you will need leiningen installed - see https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

```
lein repl :connect 4005
```

Now you have an active connection to push code onto the server, let's try some stuff (the part before => is the REPL prompt...):

```clojure
user=> (in-ns 'cljminecraft.core)
#<Namespace cljminecraft.core>

cljminecraft.core=> (ev/find-event ""break"")
(""painting.painting-break-by-entity"" ""hanging.hanging-break"" ""painting.painting-break"" ""entity.entity-break-door"" ""hanging.hanging-break-by-entity"" ""player.player-item-break"" ""block.block-break"")

;; block.block-break looks good.. lets see what we can get out of it
cljminecraft.core=> (ev/describe-event ""block.block-break"")
#{""setExpToDrop"" ""isCancelled"" ""getEventName"" ""setCancelled"" ""getExpToDrop"" ""getPlayer"" ""getBlock""}

;; Cool, getBlock looks like I can use it..
cljminecraft.core=> (defn mybreakfn [ev] {:msg (format ""You broke a %s"" (.getBlock ev))})
#'cljminecraft.core/mybreakfn

cljminecraft.core=> (ev/register-event @clj-plugin ""block.block-break"" #'mybreakfn)
nil

;; Test breaking a block, I get a crazy message, let's make that more sane
cljminecraft.core=> (defn mybreakfn [ev] {:msg (format ""You broke a %s"" (.getType (.getBlock ev)))})
#'cljminecraft.core/mybreakfn
```

And that's a quick taste of interactive development.. The Rabbit hole goes rather deep :) enjoy.

### Roll your own mod

Once you've got the cljminecraft mod installed on bukkit and you've played a bit with the REPL, you might want to build your own fully capable plugin:

```
lein new cljminecraft yourplugin
```

This will create a subfolder called yourplugin with the basics needed to get started, with some sample configuration in src/config.yml and the plugin.yml already setup under src/plugin.yml, ready to roll.

```
cd yourplugin
lein jar
cp target/*.jar /path/to/bukkit/plugins/
```

Start up your Bukkit server and go, by default, you'll see a message when you place a sign and there will be a command '/yourplugin.random' which does a dice roll. Very exciting stuff!

Remember to update your details in the plugin.yml and README.md files - and very importantly, commit to github to share with the world.

Also, be sure to look at the wiki for more in-depth instructions on all the moving parts: http://github.com/CmdrDats/clj-minecraft/wiki

Time to hack away.

## Changelog:

30 December 2012:
 - Implement a simple permissions extension for checking and setting specific permissions on players
   - This does not yet persist given player permissions across sessions
 - Added clj.permission as a command to give a player a specific permission
   - Autocompletion may need work as command lists within commands are untested.
 
29 December 2012:
 - Now sends a message to the player triggering an event when the event function returns {:msg ""...""}
 - Fix up line function
 - Add `actions` enum to events.clj
 - Add `is-block` convenience function to items.clj for checking if a block is a certain material
 
27 December 2012:
 - Introduce cut-to-mark, copy-to-mark, pen-from-mark and clear-mark
 - Interface of line and empty line-to-mark - have to work out the math involved
 - Thinking about how to define a brush instead of just 'material' and 'painting?' in the context.
 
21 December 2012:
 - Revamp the block action definitions by introducing a 'defaction' macro
 - Introduce cut, copy, paste and fork - still buggy though, especially for larger areas

19 December 2012:
 - get-material now always returns MaterialData and never Material for consistency
   - Note that this could lead to API breaks
 - Implement the first working version of the block drawing primitives
   - Similar idea to Logo, forward x, turn-right, forward x, extrude :up x
 - Playing with more things in the repl.clj scratchpatch
   - Noticed that you can send a block change to a player without changing the world.. I'll look into building the functionality to setup a 'virtual' paint mode in the block drawing. Either for all players, a list of players or a single player. It would need to track the virtual paint unless cleared so that it can resend it to players as required.
   
## Contributions

A huge thanks to aiscott and basicsensei for their contributions to clj-minecraft!

Please feel free to fork and make pull requests if you want to contribute,
I love code contributions - it makes the whole project that much more well rounded.
On that note, we're desperately needing documentation, so if you're keen to contribute
to the wiki, let me know.

===================

MinecraftServerPing is a quick and easy Java API for grabbing Minecraft server information. It allows you to access information sent to the client to display on the server list. Currently, information available is:

 * MOTD and favicon
 * Server and protocol versions
 * Player counts and samples

*MinecraftServerPing requires [Gson](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) by Google to function.*

Please leave the copyright notice intact in source if you copy source into your code rather than build path.

If you require compatibility with the previous packets, use the [alpha tag](https://github.com/jamietech/MinecraftServerPing/releases/tag/alpha).

The latest version of MinecraftServerPing is based heavily upon the work of [zh32](https://gist.github.com/zh32/7190955).

###Configuration
Configuration is provided through the `MinecraftPingOptions` class. This class provides the following configuration options:

 * `String` hostname *(hostname of the server to query, **required**)*
 * `int` port *(port of the server to query, **optional** default `25565`)*
 * `int` timeout *(socket timeout in ms, **optional** default `2000`)*
 * `String` charset *(charset for MOTD byte->string, **optional** default `UTF-8`)*

###Example

MinecraftServerPing is very easy to use and implement into any project. Simply clone the repo, compile the code and add it to your build path. Coding with it is as simple as this too:

```java
MinecraftPingReply data = new MinecraftPing().getPing(new MinecraftPingOptions().setHostname(""example.com"").setPort(25565));
System.out.println(data.getDescription() + ""  --  "" + data.getPlayers().getOnline() + ""/"" + data.getPlayers().getMax());

192,valence-rs/valence,Rust,"<img src=""assets/logo-full.svg"" width=""650"">

A Rust framework for building Minecraft: Java Edition servers.

Like [feather](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather), Valence is an effort to build a Minecraft compatible server
completely from scratch in Rust. The difference is that Valence has decided to organize the effort a little differently.
All game logic is behind a trait. This approach has many advantages. Features such as a plugin system, dedicated
executable, and vanilla game mechanics can be implemented _on top of_ Valence. Valence is a Rust library like any other.

In the future we may decide to reimplement vanilla game mechanics as a separate project. If you're developing something
like a minigame server without need for vanilla game mechanics, you can depend on Valence directly.

# Goals

Valence aims to be the following:

* **Complete**. Abstractions for the full breadth of the Minecraft protocol.
* **Flexible**. Valence provides direct access to Minecraft's protocol when necessary.
* **Minimal**. The API surface is small with only the necessities exposed. Opinionated features such as a
  standalone executable, plugin system, and reimplementation of vanilla mechanics should be built in a separate project on
  top of the foundation that Valence provides.
* **Intuitive**. An API that is easy to use and difficult to misuse. Extensive documentation is important.
* **Efficient**. Optimal use of system resources with multiple CPU cores in mind.
* **Up to date**. Targets the most recent stable version of Minecraft. Support for multiple versions at once is not
  planned (although you can use a proxy).

## Current Status

Valence is still early in development with many features unimplemented or incomplete. However, the foundations are in
place. Here are some noteworthy achievements:

- [x] A new serde library for Minecraft's Named Binary Tag (NBT) format
- [x] Authentication, encryption, and compression
- [x] Block states
- [x] Chunks
- [x] Entities and tracked data
- [x] Bounding volume hierarchy for fast spatial entity queries
- [x] Player list and player skins
- [x] Dimensions, biomes, and worlds
- [x] JSON Text API
- [x] A Fabric mod for extracting data from the game into JSON files. These files are processed by a build script to
  generate Rust code for the project. The JSON files can be used in other projects as well.
- [x] Items
- [x] Particles
- [x] Anvil file format (read only)
- [ ] Inventory
- [ ] Block entities
- [x] Proxy support ([Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/), [Bungeecord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/) and [Waterfall](https://docs.papermc.io/waterfall))
- [ ] Utilities for continuous collision detection

Here is a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P072lKE01s) showing the examples and some of its current
capabilities.

# Getting Started

## Running the Examples

You may want to try running one of the examples. After cloning the repository, run

```shell
cargo r -r --example conway
```

Next, open your Minecraft client and connect to the address `localhost`.
If all goes well you should be playing on the server.

## Adding Valence as a Dependency

Valence is published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/valence). Run `cargo add valence` to add it to your
project. Documentation is available [here](https://docs.rs/valence/latest/valence/).

However, the crates.io version is likely outdated. To use the most recent development version, add Valence as a
[git dependency](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories)
.

```toml
[dependencies]
valence = { git = ""https://github.com/valence-rs/valence"" }
```

View the documentation by running `cargo d --open` in your project.

# Overview

Realistic Terrain Generation (RTG) is a mod that adds a new world type which generates realistic terrain. It doesn't add new blocks. It doesn't add new mobs. It doesn't even add new biomes. It simply **generates more realistic-looking terrain for existing Overworld biomes** (including those added by other mods).

## Development

Want to contribute? Great! Please read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Team-RTG/Realistic-Terrain-Generation/blob/1.10.2-master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.

* We currently have 5 mods under our belt, but RTG is the main focus, and the 1.7.10 version specifically is what we are currently need to be concentrating on and then forward-porting features to 1.8.9/1.9 (although we've strayed several times to work on the 1.9 version because it's new and exciting!)

* Check out the 'dev' branch for the newest changes. The master branch always gets 'frozen' immediately after we release a new version so that people can always build the most recent release from source if they want. Also, we use the 'etc' folder to store example configs, which reflect the latest release.


### Minecraft Forum Thread

[For more information, please visit the official RTG thread on the Minecraft Forum](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2524489-realistic-terrain-generation-rtg-realistic-biomes)

### Credits
----
This mod is a re-branded fork of the revolutionary [Realistic World Gen](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1281910-teds-world-gen-mods-realistic-world-gen-alpha-1-3) mod by ted80. It was created as a new project because it was expected to deviate from ted80's original vision for RWG, and the author of this mod didn't want to interfere with that vision.

RTG is brought to you by [Team RTG](https://github.com/Team-RTG) and contains a number of [contributions](https://github.com/Team-RTG/Realistic-Terrain-Generation/graphs/contributors) from various members of the Minecraft modding community. It also uses KdotJPG's [OpenSimplex Noise](https://gist.github.com/KdotJPG/b1270127455a94ac5d19) to generate its terrain.

201,sandalle/minecraft_bigreactor_control,Lua,"Lolmer's iteration of the EZ-NUKE Minecraft BigReactor Computercraft Control Program with more stable control algorithms
============================

Description
----------------------------
This program controls a Big Reactors nuclear reactor in Minecraft with a Computercraft computer, using Computercraft's own wired modem connected to the reactors computer control port. It uses a PID (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) for each device controlled.

These scripts are known to run on:
- Minecraft 1.6.4
	- NST Diet (https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/never-stop-toasting-diet.254882)
	- NST Maxx (https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/nstmaxx.398172)

- Minecraft 1.7.10
	- FTB Infinity (http://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks/FTBInfinity)
	- Modderation: Permabanned (https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/modderation-permabanned-edition.449941)
	- Modderation: FYAD (https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/modderation-fyad-edition.696257)

- Minecraft 1.12:
	- All the Mods 3 (https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/all-the-mods-3)

To simplify the code and guesswork, I assume the following monitor layout, where each ""monitor"" listed below is a collection of three wide by two high Advanced Monitors:
- One Advanced Monitor for overall status display plus

	one or more Reactors plus

	none or more Turbines.
OR
- One Advanced Monitor for overall status display plus (furthest monitor from computer by cable length)

	one Advanced Monitor for each connected Reactor plus (subsequent found monitors)

	one Advanced Monitor for each connected Turbine (last group of monitors found).

If you enable debug mode, add one additional Advanced Monitor for #1 or #2.

Notes
----------------------------
- Only one reactor and one, two, and three turbines have been tested with the above, but IN THEORY any number is supported.
- Devices are found in the reverse order they are plugged in, so monitor_10 will be found before monitor_9.

When using actively cooled reactors with turbines, keep the following in mind:
- 1 mB steam carries up to 10RF of potential energy to extract in a turbine.
- Actively cooled reactors produce steam, not power.
- You will need about 10 mB of water for each 1 mB of steam that you want to create in a 7^3 reactor.
- Two 15x15x14 Turbines can output 260K RF/t by just one 7^3 (four rods) reactor putting out 4k mB steam.

Features
----------------------------
- Configurable min/max energy buffer and min/max temperature via ReactorOptions file.
- Disengages coils and minimizes flow for turbines over max energy buffer.
- ReactorOptions is read on start and then current values are saved every program cycle.
- Rod Control value in ReactorOptions is only useful for initial start, after that the program saves the current Rod Control average over all Fuel Rods for next boot.
- Auto-adjusts control rods per reactor to maintain temperature.
- Will display reactor data to all attached monitors of correct dimensions.
	- For multiple monitors, the first monitor (often last plugged in) is the overall status monitor.
- For multiple monitors, the first monitor (often last plugged in) is the overall status monitor.
- A new cruise mode from mechaet, ONLINE will be ""blue"" when active, to keep your actively cooled reactors running smoothly.

GUI Usage
----------------------------
- Right-clicking between ""< * >"" of the last row of a monitor alternates the device selection between Reactor, Turbine, and Status output.
	- Right-clicking ""<"" and "">"" switches between connected devices, starting with the currently selected type, but not limited to them.
- The other ""<"" and "">"" buttons, when right-clicked with the mouse, will decrease and increase, respectively, the values assigned to the monitor:
	- ""Rod (%)"" will lower/raise the Reactor Control Rods for that Reactor
	- ""mB/t"" will lower/raise the Turbine Flow Rate maximum for that Turbine
	- ""RPM"" will lower/raise the target Turbine RPM for that Turbine
- Right-clicking between the ""<"" and "">"" (not on them) will disable auto-adjust of that value for attached device.
	- Right-clicking on the ""Enabled"" or ""Disabled"" text for auto-adjust will do the same.
- Right-clicking on ""ONLINE"" or ""OFFLINE"" at the top-right will toggle the state of attached device.

Default values
----------------------------
- Rod Control: 90% (Let's start off safe and then power up as we can)
- Minimum Energy Buffer: 15% (will power on below this value)
- Maximum Energy Buffer: 85% (will power off above this value)
- Minimum Passive Cooling Temperature: 950^C (will raise control rods below this value)
- Maximum Passive Cooling Temperature: 1,400^C (will lower control rods above this value)
- Minimum Active Cooling Temperature: 300^C (will raise the control rods below this value)
- Maximum Active Cooling Temperature: 420^C (will lower control rods above this value)
- Optimal Turbine RPM:  900, 1,800
	- New user-controlled option for target speed of turbines, defaults to 1817 RPM, which is high-optimal.
	
Requirements
----------------------------
- Advanced Monitor size is X: 29, Y: 12 with a 3x2 size
- Computer or Advanced Computer
- Modems (not wireless) connecting each of the Computer to both the Advanced Monitor and Reactor Computer Port.
- Big Reactors (http://www.big-reactors.com/) 0.3.2A+ or Extreme Reactors (https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/extreme-reactors)
- Computercraft (http://computercraft.info/) 1.58, 1.63+, 1.73+, or 1.80pr1+
- Reset the computer any time number of connected devices change.

============================
- 0.3.18
	- Fix Reactor Online/Offline input non-responsive when reactor is converted from passive to active cooled (Issue #61).
	- Fix setTextScale reset to fix monitor bug in CC (Issue #68) thanks to @emp3d and @Slacker101).

	- New control algorithms using PID controllers (Pull #74) thanks to @mattsoulanille.
	- Tiny fixes for variable leaking (Pull #75) thanks to @dkowis.

- 0.3.17
	- Display how much steam (in mB/t) a Turbine is receiving on that Turbine's monitor.
	- Set monitor scale before checking size fixing Issue #50.
	- Having a monitor is now optional, closing Issue #46.
	- Incorporate steam supply and demand in reactor control thanks to @thetaphi (Nicolas Kratz).
	- Added turbine coil auto dis-/engage (Issue #51 and #55) thanks to @thetaphi (Nicolas Kratz).
	- Stop overzealous controlRodAdjustAmount adjustment amount adjustment Issue #56 thanks to @thetaphi (Nicolas Kratz).
	- Monitors can be reconfigured via GUI fixes Issue #34 thanks to @thetaphi (Nicolas Kratz).

- 0.3.16
	- Add support for ComputerCraft 1.7 (thanks dkowis and jnyl42, Issue #48).
	- Fix typo for unsupported OS (found from above)

- 0.3.15
	- Add ability to override safe values for Issue #39.

- 0.3.14
	- Fix Issue #5. EZ-Nuke should now work with ComputerCraft 1.58 or 1.63.

- 0.3.13
	- Fix one reactor and one monitor incorrectly using status display instead of control display (Issue #35)
	- Fix concatenating a string and boolean, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6615572/how-to-format-a-lua-string-with-a-boolean-variable
	- Hopefully fix concatenating string and nul in printLog (Issue #3)

- 0.3.12
	- Mechaet's changes:
	- Redid some typing to correct a bug where the reactors always started with rod control disabled.

- 0.3.11
	- Mechaet's changes:
	- Cleaned up global variables list
	- Added in per-device naming (displays a friendly name on the bottom of the monitor if configured in the device options file)
	- Bigger bypasses of control routines when the control has been overridden
	- Individual config files for turbines and reactors. Persistent between reboots, remembers your last saved settings.
	- Cruise mode override bypass
	- Changing flow rate no longer toggles flow rate override on and off. Changing the flow rate clearly indicates intent, so we put the override flag on and leave it there.
	- Changed the rate at which the regular algorithm adjusts reactor rod control rates. Instead of being 1:1 we now move at 1:5 speed because there is a wide loophole where big adjustments can cause a swinging pendulum effect continually missing the target.

- 0.3.10
	- Turbine algorithm pass by Mechaet.
	- Updated turbine GUI.
	- Fix single monitor (again) for Issue #22.

- 0.3.9
	- Reactor algorithm pass by Mechaet.

	- Fix multiple reactors and none or more turbines with only one status monitor.
	- Fix monitor scaling after one was used as debug (or in case of other modifications).
	- Cruise mode implemented, defaults off but is saved between boots.
	- Fix energy/% displays to match Big Reactors' GUI (Issue #9).
	- Always write out found devices on computer terminal.
	- Much improved round() function from mechaet (Issue #14).
	- Refactoring pass/algorithm change on the reactor temperature control. Should now adjust in increments to achieve the desired temperature range quicker and more accurately.
	- Optimal passive-cooled reactor temperature range changed from 850-900 to 950-1400.
	- Fix display Issue #15.

- 0.3.8
	- Update to ComputerCraft 1.6 API (only term.restore() -> term.native() required :)).

- 0.3.7
	- Fix typo when initializing TurbineNames array.
	- Fix Issue #1, turbine display is using the Reactor buffer size (10M RF) instead of the Turbine buffer size (1M RF).

- 0.3.6
	- Fix multi-reactors displaying on the correct monitors (thanks HybridFusion).
	- Fix rod auto-adjust text position.
	- Reactors store 10M RF and Turbines store 1M RF in their buffer.
	- Add more colour to displayAllStatus().
	- Sleep for only two seconds instead of five.
	- Fix getDeviceStoredEnergyBufferPercent() for Reactors storing 10M RF in buffer.
	- Keep actively cooled reactors between 0-300^C (non-configurable for now).

- 0.3.5
	- Do not discover connected devices every loop - nicer on servers. Reset computer anytime number of connected devices change.
	- Fix multi-reactor setups to display the additional reactors on monitors, rather than the last one found.
	- Fix passive reactor display having auto-adjust and energy buffer overwrite each other (removes rod count).

	- First found monitor (appears to be last connected monitor) is used to display status of all found devices (if more than one valid monitor is found)
	- Display monitor number on top left of each monitor as ""M#"" to help find which monitor is which.
	- Enabling debug will use the last monitor found, if more than one, to print out debug info (also written to file)
	- Only clear monitors when we're about to use them (e.g. turbine monitors no longer clear, then wait for all reactors to update)
	- Fix getDeviceStoredEnergyBufferPercent(), was off by a decimal place
	- Just use first Control Rod level for entire reactor, they are no longer treated individually in BR 0.3
	- Allow for one monitor for n number of reactors and m number of turbines
	- Auto-adjust turbine flow rate by 25 mB to keep rotor speed at 900 or 1,800 RPM.
	- Clicks on monitors relate to what the monitor is showing (e.g. clicking on reactor 1's display won't modify turbine 1's nor reactor 2's values)
	- Print monitor name and device (reactor|turbine) name in blue to monitor associated for easier design by users.
	- Remove version number from monitors to free up space for monitor names.
	- Add option of right-clicking on ""Enabled""/""Disabled"" of auto-adjust to toggle it.

	- Don't redirect terminal output with multiple monitor support
	- Log troubleshooting data to reactorcontrol.log
	- FC_API no longer used (copied and modified what I needed)
	- Multi-reactor support is theoretically implemented, but it is UNTESTED!
	- Updated for Big Reactor 0.3 (no longer works with 0.2)
	- BR getFuelTemperature() now returns many significant digits, just use math.ceil()
	- BR 0.3 removed individual rod temperatures, now it's only reactor-level temperature

- 0.2.4
	- Simplify math, don't divide by a simple large number and then multiply by 100 (#/10000000*100)
	- Fix direct-connected (no modem) devices. getDeviceSide -> FC_API.getDeviceSide (simple as that :))

- 0.2.3
	- Check bounds on reactor.setRodControlLevel(#,#), Big Reactor doesn't check for us.

- 0.2.2
	- Do not auto-start the reactor if it was manually powered off (autoStart=false)

- 0.2.1
	- Lower/raise only the hottest/coldest Control Rod while trying to control the reactor temperature.
	- ""<"" Rod Control buttons was off by one (to the left)

- 0.2.0 - Lolmer Edition :)
	- Add min/max stored energy percentage (default is 15%/85%), configurable via ReactorOptions file.

The monospaced font for developers who like Minecraft a bit _too_ much.

*Notice: This project is not affiliated with Minecraft or Mojang in any way and is exclusively a fan project. This font emulates the typeface of the font used in the Minecraft UI, but it does not include any assets or font files from the original game.*

## Features

- Minecraft!
  - The characters in this font were based around the [typeface](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font) used in the Minecraft UI, with each glyph updated for better readability and spacing
- Monospaced!
  - Each of the 500+ glyphs included in this font have been carefully redesigned to work in a monospaced font
  - Thin characters like ""i"" and ""l"" have been reworked with tasteful tails and serifs to look better in a monospaced environment
- Programming ligatures!
  - Add some spice to your programming life with all new ligature characters
  - Arrows now look like arrows and comparison operators are easier to see at a glance

## Glyphs

## How to install

### Windows

Download the most recent `Monocraft.ttf` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/releases) page. Right click on the downloaded font and select **Install**. You might need administrative access to install fonts, depending on your machine.

### Mac

#### Using Homebrew

```shell
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-monocraft
```

#### Manually

Download the most recent `Monocraft.ttf` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/releases) page. Double click on the downloaded font file and select **Install Font** in the window that appears. More help available [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749).

### Linux

Download the most recent `Monocraft.ttf` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/releases) page. Move the file to ~/.local/share/fonts (create the folder if it doesn't already exist). In a terminal, run `fc-cache -fv`. Alternatively, log out and log in again. 

## How to use

After following the installation instructions up above, simply select the ""Monocraft"" font (note the space) in any application that supports custom fonts. You might need to restart the application or your computer for the font to appear.

## FAQ

### What ligatures are available?

So far, the following ligatures have been added to the font:

<img src=""images/ligatures.png"" width=""300"">

If there is another character combination that you feel could be a ligature, feel free to create an issue!

### How are these characters generated?

Using [FontForge's](https://fontforge.org/en-US/) excellent Python extension, the glyphs are created from configuration files representing each character's pixels. Diacritics are created separately and are combined with the original characters to create over 500 unique glyphs. To learn more, check out the source code in the [src](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/tree/main/src) folder.

### Do you have a version with the original Minecraft font (not monospaced)?

I've got you covered, check out my rendition of the Minecraft typeface [here](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font).

### What if I want to use a font that's actually good?

Understandable, check out [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for a font with amazing attention to detail, or [Scientifica](https://github.com/nerdypepper/scientifica) for a bitmap font similar to this.
"
204,facebookresearch/craftassist,TeX,"The goal of this project is to build an intelligent, collaborative assistant bot in the game of [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/)<sup>1</sup> that can perform a wide variety of tasks specified by human players. Its primary purpose is to be a tool for artifical intelligence researchers interested in grounded dialogue and interactive learning. This project is in active development.

A detailed outline and documentation is available in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08584)

This release is motivated by a long-term research agenda described [here](https://research.fb.com/publications/why-build-an-assistant-in-minecraft/).

![GIF of Gameplay With Bot](https://craftassist.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pubr/bot_46.gif)

# Installation

## Option A: Docker

The fastest way to install CraftAssist is by building a [Docker](https://docker.com) image.

After installing Docker, go to your Docker resource settings and make sure that the memory allocated to Docker is at least 4GB 
(smaller amounts of memory can result in the build crashing). Then, clone the CraftAssist repo and run:

```
cd craftassist/docker
docker build -t craftassist -f Dockerfile.client .
```

## Option B: Local Setup

Do this section *before* cloning the repo.

### Dependencies

Make sure the following packages have already been installed before moving on:
* CMake
* Python3
* Glog
* Boost
* Eigen
* gcc version: 7.4.0 on ubuntu 18.04
* For Mac users:
  * LLVM version < 10 to successfully use clang. [Working with multiple versions of Xcode](https://medium.com/@hacknicity/working-with-multiple-versions-of-xcode-e331c01aa6bc).

### Install git-lfs

```
# OSX
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install

# On Ubuntu
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

### Checking out the repo

Use this command, or your submodules will not be pulled, and your clone will take a very long time:

```
git lfs clone --recursive git@github.com:facebookresearch/craftassist.git
```

Now `cd craftassist` and copy the large data file and untar it to the correct directories:

```
curl http://craftassist.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pubr/models_folder.tar.gz -o models_folder.tar.gz
tar -xzvf models_folder.tar.gz -C python/craftassist/models/ --strip-components 1
curl http://craftassist.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pubr/ground_truth_data.txt -o python/craftassist/ground_truth_data.txt

```

### Python Requirements: Using A Conda Environment
To build a conda environment that supports this release:
```
# Create a new env preloaded with the conda install dependencies
conda create -n minecraft_env python==3.7.4 pip numpy scikit-learn==0.19.1 pytorch torchvision -c conda-forge -c pytorch
conda activate minecraft_env

# Install all of the rest of the dependencies with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then activate this environment whenever you want to run the agent.

### Building client and server

To build Cuberite and the C++ Minecraft client:
```
make
```

# Interacting with the Agent

## Run the Cuberite instance

If you did a local install, run the following from the cloned repository directory:

```
python ./python/cuberite_process.py
```

to start an instance of Cuberite listening on `localhost:25565`


If you installed CraftAssist using Docker, start a shell in a new Docker container with:

```
docker run -p 25565:25565 -it --name craftassist-container craftassist
```

and run the above `python` command in the default directory of that shell.

## Connecting your Minecraft game client (so you can see what's happening)

Buy and download the [official Minecraft client](https://my.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft/).

You can inspect the world and view the Minecraft agent's actions by logging into the
running Cuberite instance from the game client.

To connect the client to the running Cuberite instance, click in the Minecraft client:

```
Multiplayer > Direct Connect > localhost:25565
```

#### Error: Unsupported Protocol Version

Minecraft has recently release v1.15.2, and our Cuberite system supports at most v1.12

[Please follow these instructions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-) to add a 1.12.x profile and use it to connect.

## Running the interactive V0 agent

Assuming you have set up the [Cuberite server](https://github.com/facebookresearch/craftassist#run-the-cuberite-instance) 
and the [client](https://github.com/facebookresearch/craftassist#connecting-your-minecraft-game-client-so-you-can-see-whats-happening):

* Docker users should open a second shell in their container with:
```
docker exec -it craftassist-container bash
```
* Local users should open a new terminal in the repository directory.

In the new shell, run:

```
python ./python/craftassist/craftassist_agent.py
```

You should see a new bot player join the game.

Chat with the bot by pressing `t` to open the dialogue box, and `Enter` to submit.

Use the `w`, `a`, `s`, and `d` keys to navigate, left and right mouse clicks to destroy and place blocks, and `e` to open your inventory and select blocks to place.

## Running tests

```
./python/craftassist/test.sh
```

## Datasets

Download links to the datasets described in section 6 of [Technical Whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08584) are provided here:

- **The house dataset**: https://craftassist.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pubr/house_data.tar.gz

by [Chris Lloyd](http://github.com/chrislloyd) @ [Minefold](https://minefold.com)

This adapter will connect your Hubot instance to a Mincraft server. You'll need a seperate paid Minecraft account to connect.

This adapter is **BETA**. It contains what we think is a pretty complete implementation of the Minecraft protocol, but there are definitely cases that it can't handle.

![Marvin](http://f.cl.ly/items/3v47303S1W2O2Z1V060Q/Screen%20Shot%202012-01-06%20at%204.53.57%20PM.png)

or check out a [quick video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XWtZmYtQcE) of it in action.

## Configuring the Adapter

The Minecraft adapter requires the following environment variables.

* `HUBOT_MINECRAFT_HOST`
* `HUBOT_MINECRAFT_PORT`
* `HUBOT_MINECRAFT_USERNAME`
* `HUBOT_MINECRAFT_PASSWORD`

### Minecraft Host

This is your Minecraft server's host. It'll will look something like `pluto.minefold.com`.

### Minecraft Port

This is the port your Minecraft server is running on. By default, Minecraft runs on port `25565`.

### Minecraft Username

This is the username of a paid Minecraft account.

### Minecraft Password

This is the Minecraft account's password.

### Configuring the variables on Heroku

    % heroku config:add HUBOT_MINECRAFT_HOST=""...""
    % heroku config:add HUBOT_MINECRAFT_PORT=""...""
    % heroku config:add HUBOT_MINECRAFT_USERNAME=""...""
    % heroku config:add HUBOT_MINECRAFT_PASSWORD=""...""

### Configuring the variables on UNIX

    % export HUBOT_MINECRAFT_HOST=""...""
    % export HUBOT_MINECRAFT_PORT=""...""
    % export HUBOT_MINECRAFT_USERNAME=""...""
    % export HUBOT_MINECRAFT_PASSWORD=""...""

### DEFINITIONS:
- _only text in braces needs to be modified (remember to remove all braces)_  
- _Some of these parameters can be configured with command-line arguments (--help to know which)_  

Location of server folder and executable. You can find protocol/version [here](https://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers) (but msh should set them automatically):
```yaml
""Server"": {
  ""Folder"": ""{path/to/server/folder}""
  ""FileName"": ""{server.jar}""
  ""Version"": ""1.19.2""
  ""Protocol"": 760
}
```

Commands to start and stop minecraft server  
_StopServerAllowKill allows to kill the server after a certain amount of time (in seconds) when it's not responding_
```yaml
""Commands"": {
  ""StartServer"": ""java <Commands.StartServerParam> -jar <Server.FileName> nogui""
  ""StartServerParam"": ""-Xmx1024M -Xms1024M""
  ""StopServer"": ""stop""
  ""StopServerAllowKill"": 10	# set to -1 to disable
}
```

Set the logging level for debug purposes
```yaml
""Debug"": 1
# 0 - NONE: no log
# 1 - BASE: basic log
# 2 - SERV: mincraft server log
# 3 - DEVE: developement log
# 4 - BYTE: connection bytes log
```

Port to which players can connect
```yaml
""ListenPort"": 25555
```

*30 seconds* is the time (after the last player disconnected) that msh waits before hibernating the minecraft server
```yaml
""TimeBeforeStoppingEmptyServer"": 30
```

SuspendAllow allow the server to suspend server process when there are no players online  
_To mitigate ram usage you can set a high swappiness (on linux)_  
- pro:  player wait time to join frozen server is ~0  
- cons: ram usage as minecraft server without msh (cpu remains ~0)  

SuspendRefresh enables refresh of minecraft server suspension every set seconds (to avoid unexplained crashes at unsuspension)
- set -1 to disable
- set it to a value that suits you
```yaml
""SuspendAllow"": false
""SuspendRefresh"": -1
```

Hibernation and Starting server description
```yaml
""InfoHibernation"": ""                   §fserver status:\n                   §b§lHIBERNATING""
""InfoStarting"": ""                   §fserver status:\n                    §6§lWARMING UP""
```

Set to false if you don't want notifications (every 20 minutes)
```yaml
""NotifyUpdate"": true
""NotifyMessage"": true
```

Whitelist contains IPs and player names that are allowed to start the server (leave empty to allow everyone)  
WhitelistImport adds `whitelist.json` to player names that are allowed to start the server  
_unknown clients are not allowed to start the server, but can join_  
```yaml
""Whitelist"": [""127.0.0.1"", ""gekigek99""]
""WhitelistImport"": false
```

209,Shedelbower/MinecraftClone,C#,"*NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG.*

# MinecraftClone
This project is my attempt to create a somewhat convincing clone of the popular game Minecraft from scratch in Unity. This is by no means a complete recreation of Minecraft, though it does include a few core features.

I created this project for fun in my free time with no plan for how I wanted it to turn out. Because of this, the code is not optimal and could certainly be improved.

## Features
- Infinite world generation
- Fully modifiable terrain
- Block updates
  - Block gravity
  - Basic water flow
- Simple user interface
  - Hotbar
  - Start menu
  - Pause menu
- Usable items
  - Ender pearls
  - TNT (throwable)
  - Bone meal

More details available here: https://shedelbower.dev/projects/minecraft_clone

## Modpack permission

Yes. >)

## Regarding Toaru Magic Index

Many people have been asking questions about whether or how much the mod will be related to
the original story _A Certain Magic Index_. Our answer is that although AC is based on the 
_Railgun_, which is a spinoff of _Index_, the mod will only focus on the science side of 
the story, and thus just loosely related to _Index_.

The mod is dedicated to build an interesting experience evolved around the idea of **superability**,
that's really everything.

# Lithium (for Fabric)
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric.svg)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric.svg)
![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric.svg)

Lithium is a free and open-source Minecraft mod which works to optimize many areas of the game in order to provide
better overall performance. It works on both the **client and server**, and **doesn't require the mod to be installed
on both sides**.

### What makes Lithium different?

One of the most important design goals in Lithium is *correctness*. Unlike other mods which apply optimizations to the
game, Lithium does not sacrifice vanilla functionality or behavior in the name of raw speed. It's a no compromises
solution for those wanting to speed up their game, and as such, installing Lithium should be completely transparent
to the player.

If you do encounter an issue where Lithium deviates from the norm, please don't hesitate to
[open an issue.](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/issues) Each patch is carefully checked to ensure
vanilla parity, but after all, bugs are unavoidable. Before opening a new issue, please check using the search tool that your issue has not already been created, and that if
there is a suitable template for the issue you are opening, that it is filled out entirely. Issues which are duplicates
or do not contain the necessary information to triage and debug may be closed. 

### Community
[![Discord chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat%20on-discord-7289DA)](https://jellysquid.me/discord)

We have an [official Discord community](https://jellysquid.me/discord) for all of our projects. By joining, you can:
- Get installation help and technical support with all of our mods 
- Be notified of the latest developments as they happen
- Get involved and collaborate with the rest of our team
- ... and just hang out with the rest of our community.

### Support the developers

Lithium is made possible by the following core contributors [and others](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/graphs/contributors).
You can help support members of the core team by making a pledge to our Patreon pages below.

## Installation

### Manual installation (recommended)

You will need Fabric Loader installed in your game in order to load Lithium. If you haven't installed Fabric mods
before, you can find a variety of community guides for doing so [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install).

#### Stable releases

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric.svg)

The latest releases of Lithium are published to our [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and
[GitHub release](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/releases) pages. Releases are considered by our team to be
**suitable for general use**, but they are not guaranteed to be free of bugs and other issues.

Usually, releases will be made available on GitHub slightly sooner than other locations.

#### Bleeding-edge builds (unstable)

[![GitHub build status](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

If you are a player who is looking to get your hands on the latest **bleeding-edge changes for testing**, consider
taking a look at the automated builds produced through
our [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml?query=event%3Apush)
. This workflow automatically runs every time a change is pushed to the repository, and as such, the builds it produces
will generally reflect the latest snapshot of development.

Bleeding edge builds will often include unfinished code that hasn't been extensively tested. That code may introduce
incomplete features, bugs, crashes, and all other kinds of weird issues. You **should not use these bleeding edge builds**
unless you know what you are doing and are comfortable with software debugging. If you report issues using these builds,
we will expect that this is the case. Caveat emptor.

### CurseForge

[![CurseForge downloads](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_360438_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium)

If you are using the CurseForge client, you can continue to find downloads through our
[CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium). Unless you are using the CurseForge
client, you should prefer the downloads linked on our Modrinth or GitHub release pages above.

---

### Building from sources

Support is not provided for setting up build environments or compiling the mod. We ask that
users who are looking to get their hands dirty with the code have a basic understanding of compiling Java/Gradle
projects. The basic overview is provided here for those familiar.

#### Requirements

- JDK 17
    - You can either install this through a package manager such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows
      or [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) on other platforms. If you'd prefer to not use a package manager, you can always
      grab the installers or packages directly from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
- Gradle 7 or newer (optional)
    - The [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:using_wrapper) is provided
      in this repository can be used instead of installing a suitable version of Gradle yourself. However, if you are
      building many projects, you may prefer to install it yourself through a suitable package manager as to save disk
      space and to avoid many Gradle daemons sitting around in memory.

#### Building with Gradle

Lithium uses a typical Gradle project structure and can be built by simply running the default `build` task. After Gradle
finishes building the project, you can find the build artifacts (typical mod binaries, and their sources) in
`build/libs`.

**Tip:** If this is a one-off build, and you would prefer the Gradle daemon does not stick around in memory afterwards,
try adding the [`--no-daemon` flag](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon)
to ensure that the daemon is torn down after the build is complete. However, subsequent builds of the project will
[start more slowly](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:why_the_daemon) if the Gradle
daemon is not available to be re-used.

Build artifacts ending in `api` are for developers compiling against Lithium's API.

### Configuration

Out of the box, no additional configuration is necessary once the mod has been installed. Lithium makes use of a
configuration override system which allows you to either forcefully disable problematic patches or enable incubating
patches which are otherwise disabled by default. As such, an empty config file simply means you'd like to use the
default configuration, which includes all stable optimizations by default.

See [the Wiki page](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on the configuration file
format and all available options. The wiki may be outdated.

This is a prometheus minecraft exporter

This exporter reads minecrafts nbt files, the advancements files and can optionally connect via RCON to your minecraft server.

To use it mount your world to /world in the container

RCON connection is used to get online Players   
On Forge Servers enable FORGE_SERVER to get tps information   
On Paper Servers enable PAPER_SERVER to get tps information

To enable rcon on your minecraft server add the following to the server.properties file:

```
broadcast-rcon-to-ops=false
rcon.port=25575
rcon.password=Password
enable-rcon=true
```

> Note: Broadcast RCON to ops is disabled, to avoid ops receiving spam whilst ingame.

218,equalpants/pigmap,C++,"pigmap is a Minecraft map renderer, designed to be fast enough for very large worlds (like
the Aporkalypse Now server, hence the name).  It was inspired by Minecraft Overviewer and does
essentially the same thing, just faster and with fewer fancy options.  Features include:

-isometric projection; level of detail on max zoom is user-settable
-Google Maps tile output
-custom tilesets (supply your own terrain.png)
-ability to manually edit the isometric block images generated from terrain.png,
  for further beautification
-incremental map updates, but you must supply your own list of modified chunks (most
  likely via rsync or something similar)
-multithreading
-support for Alpha (chunk-based), Beta (.mcr), or Anvil (.mca) world formats
-ability to restrict rendering to a certain range of Y-values (heights)

pigmap is free under the GPL (please see the file COPYING).  I probably won't add too many
more features beyond whatever the Aporkalypse might need in the future, but hopefully it will
be useful to someone.

The files template.html and style.css contain code from Minecraft Overviewer (copyright

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supported platforms are Linux and cygwin.  OS X should also be fine, but I haven't tried it
myself.  (I've heard reports of it working, though.)

Dependencies are zlib, libpng, pthreads, and some very basic system stuff: getopt, mkdir,
dirent.h.  If your platform has a separate development package for libpng (called libpng-dev,
libpng-devel, or something like that), you'll need that one, too.

Use supplied makefile to build with g++.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change log (important stuff only):

1.2
-new blocks up to Minecraft 1.3
-chest.png, etc. now required
-some speed improvements
-block IDs >= 256 (from mods) now ignored rather than drawn as random blocks

0.5.1
-speed improvements
-previously, we would abort if the world was too absurdly large to deal with--i.e. if there were
  some chunks whose coordinates were well into the billions--but apparently there is a Minecraft
  bug that can create such chunks way off in space, even if the world is normally-sized, so now
  we just ignore any chunks that are too far out to handle

0.5
-initial version

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage examples:

full render:

pigmap -B 6 -T 1 -Z 10 -i input/World1 -o output/World1 -g images -h 3

...builds a map with parameters B = 6, T = 1, baseZoom = 10, reading world data from the path
""input/World1"", writing tiles out to the path ""output/World1"", reading terrain images from the path
""images"", and using 3 threads.

incremental update:

pigmap -i input/World1 -o output/World1 -r regionlist -h 3 -x

...updates an existing map by redrawing any tiles touched by regions listed in the file ""regionlist"",
with the input and output dirs as before.  Terrain images are read from the path ""."", and 3 threads
are used.  Map parameters are read from the existing map, and if the existing baseZoom is too small,
it will be incremented.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Error messages are written to stderr; normal output to stdout.  There isn't much (read: any) of a
progress indicator at the moment, but there are some statistics upon completion.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of command-line options:


1. Params for both full renders and incremental updates:

a. input path, output path (-i, -o)

The input path should be the top directory of the world data (i.e. where level.dat is).  The tile
output path should be the top of the Google Maps directory structure (i.e. where base.png is).  Tile
images will be written to the output path, along with a file ""pigmap.params"" which remembers what
parameters the map was drawn with.  For incremental updates, the output path must exist already, and
must contain the pigmap.params file.

Three world formats are supported: the current Anvil format (with .mca region files), the .mcr
region format that preceded it, and the even older chunk-based format.  If the input path contains
more than one format, then only the newer format will be used.

b. [optional (kind of)] HTML source path (-m)

This is where pigmap expects to find the files ""template.html"" and ""style.css"", which it will
use to construct a bare-bones HTML page for viewing the map.  These files are not optional, but
the -m parameter itself may be omitted, in which case ""."" is used as the HTML source path.

The map-viewing page is called ""pigmap-default.html"" and is written to the output path.  It doesn't have
any fancy capabilities (just plain old markers); it's meant only to demonstrate the JavaScript for
converting Minecraft coords to Google Maps latitude/longitude.  This file is rewritten with every
incremental update; make a copy if you need to add fancier abilities to it.

c. [optional (kind of)] image path (-g)

This is where pigmap expects to find either a copy of your tileset (terrain.png, etc.), or a copy of
blocks-B.png (substituting the actual numeric value of B; see below for definition of B), a
pigmap-generated file that contains the isometric renderings of each block.  These files are not
optional, but the -g parameter itself may be omitted, in which case ""."" is used as the image path.

Each blocks-B.png comes with a corresponding blocks-B.version, which remembers how many block images
are stored in blocks-B.png.  (As more blocks are added to the game, the version will change.)

The selection of block images works thusly:

-If blocks-B.png does not exist, then the tileset you provide will be used to create it.
-If blocks-B.png exists but has an old version, your tileset will be used to fill in any missing
  (i.e. new) blocks, but the existing portions of blocks-B.png will be preserved.
-If blocks-B.png exists and is up-to-date, its block images will be used.

This means that pigmap will need your tileset the first time it runs, so it can generate blocks-B.png;
subsequent runs will use the existing blocks-B.png, which can be manually edited if insufficiently
pretty, or for special effects, etc.

The following images are required to generate blocks-B.png:
-terrain.png, chest.png, largechest.png, enderchest.png: these files come from your tileset
  or minecraft.jar
-fire.png, endportal.png: these files are included with pigmap
All of these must be RGBA png files (not just RGB).

High-res tilesets are supported.  The textures in terrain.png, fire.png, and endportal.png can be
any size, as long as they remain square.  The textures in the chest pngs can be scaled up, but their
size must be an integer multiple of the original size.

d. [optional] number of threads (-h)

Defaults to 1.  Each thread requires around 250-300 MB of RAM (they work in different areas of the
map and keep separate caches of chunk data).  Returns from extra threads may diminish quickly as the
disk becomes a bottleneck.


2. Params for full renders only:

a. map parameters B, T, [optional] baseZoom (-B, -T, -Z):

B is an integer >= 2 which controls the size (in pixels) of the blocks in the base zoom level.  The
map projection lays out blocks on a hexagonal grid generated from the distances [+/-2B, +/-B] and
[0, +/-2B], and each individual block's bounding box is 4B x 4B.

T is the tile multiplier, an integer >= 1 which controls how many chunks wide a tile is.

The size of each generated tile is 64BT x 64BT.

(To match Minecraft Overviewer's highest zoom level, use B=6 and T=1, for a tile size of 384 x 384.
To match its second-highest zoom, use B=3 and T=2.)

baseZoom is the Google Maps zoom level that the base tiles should be placed on.  This is important
because Google Maps allows only 2^Z by 2^Z tiles for each zoom level Z; if baseZoom is not high enough,
some tiles will not fit on the Google Map.  (Out-of-bounds tiles will be noticed at the start of a
render, and the render aborted.)

If baseZoom is omitted, it will be set to the lowest value that can fit all the required tiles.

b. [optional] minimum/maximum Y-coords (-y, -Y)

By default, pigmap will draw all blocks present in the world data, but these parameters can be
used to restrict rendering to blocks within a particular height range.  -y is the minimum Y-coord
which will be drawn, and -Y is the maximum.

Note that these values, if used, will persist through incremental updates of the map (like B and T
do), even if the actual height limit in the game changes in the future.  So if you want the map to
always render all the way to the top, then *don't use* -Y, as opposed to using it but passing in
the *current* height limit.


3. Params for incremental updates only:

a. regionlist file (-r) or chunklist file (-c)

The name of a text file containing the filenames of regions or chunks that should be updated, one per
line.  Supplied filenames can have a relative or absolute path or can just be the file name; only the
name will be examined.

If the input world is in region format (either .mca or .mcr regions), then a regionlist must be used,
not a chunklist.  However, the extensions on the filenames in a regionlist do not matter--only the
coordinates from the filenames will be considered, and pigmap will always read the newest available
region.

The current format of the input world does *not* have to match the format used in the previous map
render--an incremental update will work fine even if the world data has been converted since the
last render.  (Of course it would be trickier to get a meaningful regionlist in such a case--to
distinguish the regions which have actually changed from those which have merely been converted--
but if you have such a list, then pigmap can use it.)

b. [optional] expand map if necessary (-x)

This is useful for frequently-updated maps: eventually, as the world expands outwards, it will become
too large for the current baseZoom, and an incremental update will fail.  If -x has been passed, then
if an incremental update fails due to out-of-bounds tiles, the map's baseZoom will be increased by
1, and the update retried.  (The baseZoom increase is *not* undone if the second attempt also fails.)

Note that increasing a map's baseZoom is quick: all the tiles are simply moved one level deeper in
the hierarchy, and the top two zoom levels redrawn.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What happens in a full render: the world data is scanned, and every chunk that exists on disk is noted.
All tiles that include any chunks are rendered and saved; any tiles that might exist already in the
output path are overwritten.

What happens in an incremental update: the chunklist is read and its chunks are considered ""required"";
the world data is not scanned.  (However, the input path must still contain the non-required chunks;
that is, you can't just use a partial copy of a world.  This is because each tile touches multiple
chunks; to render a required chunk, data from its non-required neighbors may be necessary.)  All tiles
that include required chunks are rendered and saved.  Base tiles that exist already in the output path
are overwritten, but those at lower zoom levels are merely modified--only the changed portions
are redrawn.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Special note for those who choose to manually edit blocks-B.png:

When new block types are introduced, their block images are added on to the end of blocks-B.png,
and the existing contents are preserved, so you don't need to worry about previous modifications
getting destroyed.  However, sometimes it may be necessary to remove existing block images and
replace them with new versions; when this happens, the old block image offset will no longer be
used, and a new block image will be added to the end of the file.

Example: prior to pigmap 0.6, the furnace block images were located at offsets 68, 69, and 149-152.
Starting with 0.6, they are instead located at 183-188.  (This is because the furnace graphics
were changed in Minecraft Beta 1.2.)  So if you modified the furnace block images while using a
pre-0.6 version of pigmap, your modified images can still be found at their old locations in your
blocks-B.png, but they must be copied to the new locations.

219,MCHPR/MCHPRS,Rust,"# Minecraft High-Performance Redstone Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MCHPR/MCHPRS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MCHPR/MCHPRS) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) [![Discord Banner 2](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/724072903083163679/widget.png)](https://discord.com/invite/svK9JU7)

A Minecraft 1.18.2 creative server built for redstone. Each 256x256 plot runs on a separate thread, allowing for less lag, more concurrency, and many awesome extra features!

MCHPRS is very different from traditional servers. Because this server is tailored to the use of computation redstone, many things that are a part of Vanilla Minecraft servers don't exist here. That being said, MCHPRS comes with many of its own unique features.

MCHPRS has made it possible to run programs such as [Graph Rendering, Conway's Game of Life, and Mandelbrot Rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDiapbD0Xfg) on CPUs in Minecraft. To accomplish these speeds, we created [Redpiler](docs/Redpiler.md), the ""Redstone Compiler"".

## Building

If the Rust compiler is not already installed, you can find out how [on their official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MCHPR/MCHPRS.git
cd MCHPRS
cargo build --release
```

Once complete, the optimized executable will be located at `./target/release/mchprs` or `./target/release/mchprs.exe` depending on your operating system.

## Configuration

MCHPRS will generate a `Config.toml` file in the current working directory when starting the server if it does not exist.

### LuckPerms

MCHPRS has basic support for LuckPerms with MySQL or MariaDB remote database storage. This implementation has no commands or interface and would have to be manged through LuckPerms running on a proxy (`/lpb`) or other server (`/lp`)

To use LuckPerms, append this to your `Config.toml`:

```toml
[luckperms]
# Define the address for the database.
host = ""localhost""
# The name of the database the LuckPerms data is in.
db_name = ""minecraft""
# Credentials for the database.
username = ""minecraft""
password = ""minecraft""
# The name of the server, used for server specific permissions.
# See: https://luckperms.net/wiki/Context
server_context = ""global""
```

A Minecraft client running in a web page. **Live demo at https://webclient.prismarine.js.org/**


## How it Works
prismarine-web-client runs mineflayer and prismarine-viewer in the browser, which connects over WebSocket to a proxy 
which translates the WebSocket connection into TCP to connect to normal Minecraft servers. Prismarine-web-client is based on:
* [prismarine-viewer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-viewer) for the world rendering
* [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) for the high-level Minecraft client API

Check these modules if you want to understand more how it works and contribute!

## Screenshot
![Screenshot of prismarine-web-client in action](screenshot.png)

## Live Demo
Click on this link to open it in your browser, no installation necessary: https://webclient.prismarine.js.org/

*Tested on Chrome & Firefox for desktop platforms.*

## Usage
To host it yourself, run these commands in bash: 
```bash
$ npm install -g prismarine-web-client
$ prismarine-web-client
``` 
Finally, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Features

* Display mobs and players
* Display blocks 
* Movement (you can move, and you see entities moving live)
* Place and break blocks

## Roadmap
* Containers (inventory, chests, etc.)
* Sounds
* More world interactions (attacking entities, etc.)
* Cosmetic rendering features (day night cycle, fog, etc.)

## Development

If you're contributing/making changes, you need to install it differently.

First, clone the repo.

Then, set your working directory to that of the repo. For example:
```bash
$ cd ~/prismarine-web-client/
```

Finally, run

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This will start express and webpack in development mode; whenever you save a file, the build will be redone (it takes 5s), 
and you can refresh the page to get the new result.

Connect to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You may want to disable auto saving in your IDE to avoid constant rebuilding; see https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#adjusting-your-text-editor.

To check the production build (will take a minute to build), you can run `npm run build-start`.

If you're interested in contributing, you can check projects at https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-web-client/projects.

Some variables are exposed in the global ``window`` object for debugging:
* ``bot``
* ``viewer``
* ``mcData``
* ``worldView``
* ``Vec3``
* ``pathfinder``
* ``debugMenu``

### Adding stuff to the debugMenu

debugMenu.customEntries['myKey'] = 'myValue'
delete debugMenu.customEntries['myKey']

### Some debugging examples

In Chrome DevTools:

* `bot.chat('test')` allows you to use the chat
* `bot.chat(JSON.stringify(Object.values(bot.players).map(({username, ping}) => ({username, ping}))))` display the ping of everyone
* `window.bot.entity.position.y += 5` jumps
* `bot.chat(JSON.stringify(bot.findBlock({matching:(block) => block.name==='diamond_ore', maxDistance:256}).position))` finds the position of a diamond block
* `bot.physics.stepHeight = 2` allows you to walk about blocks
* `bot.physics.sprintSpeed = 5` walks faster
* `bot.loadPlugin(pathfinder.pathfinder)` then `bot.pathfinder.goto(new pathfinder.goals.GoalXZ(100, 100))` goes to position 100, 100

For more debugging ideas, read the [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) doc.

此资源包仅适用于**Minecraft Java版**。**关于适用于Minecraft基岩版的资源包，参见[基岩版梗体中文](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/mcwzh-meme-resourcepack-bedrock)。**

**注：若发现可能存在该资源包上头的情况，请立刻~~食用~~阅读[译名标准化](https://minecraft.fandom.com/zh/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki:译名标准化)。**

[![Banner](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/mcwzh-meme-resourcepack/blob/master/materials/zh_meme_banner.png?raw=true)](https://www.mcbbs.net/thread-1004643-1-1.html)

## 作用

这个资源包将一部分译名或其他游戏内字符串替换成了一些知名/不知名的梗或笑话，或将其用诙谐的语言重写了一遍。

## 用法

在[Releases](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/mcwzh-meme-resourcepack/releases)中下载此资源包，或在[网页构建](https://dl.meme.teahou.se/)中选择自定义选项下载。

### 常规

请选择 `mcwzh-meme.zip` 下载，像其他资源包一样复制到你对应的 `.minecraft/resourcepacks/` 目录中（[MCBBS上的教程](https://www.mcbbs.net/thread-880869-1-1.html)）（MultiMC或其他分离版本的启动器请自行查找）。资源包新建了一个语言，安装启用后在语言设置中选择“**梗体中文**”即可体验。

### 加载Mod时

普通版本的资源包**无法**覆盖所有的Mod字符串，会导致大部分Mod的内容**全部变为英文**。请下载 `mcwzh-meme_compatible.zip` ，以保证体验。安装流程几乎相同，只是选择的语言应该是**普通的“简体中文”**。

关于支持梗体中文的Mod，请见[支持的Mod](./list_of_supported_mods.md)页面。

### 1.12.2及以下版本支持

1.13对可翻译字符串进行了一次破坏性更改，这意味着1.12.2及以下无法直接正常使用本资源包。同时，1.12.2及以下版本并不支持读取ASCII格式的Unicode码。通过建立映射表，我们初步实现了1.12.2及以下版本对大部分字符串的支持（也就是除去命令），详见Issue [#34](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/mcwzh-meme-resourcepack/issues/34)。1.12.2及以下版本请使用带有 `_legacy` 的预设包。

### 对旧版本的兼容

本仓库中的语言文件和最新的Java版的语言文件保持同步。对旧版本，我们采用了“模块”的方式保持兼容。构建时请加入参数 `-r <语言模块名称>` 来将其加入到主语言文件中。[这里](./list_of_language_modules.md)列出了目前所有的语言模块。

### 唱片替换

该资源包将唱片信息修改成了非Minecraft歌曲。由于版权原因，您需要自行制作一个唱片替换资源包（可以参考[这篇文章](https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/how-to-change-music-discs-to-any-song---easy/)）。一份不受支持的预制版唱片替换包（不允许二次分发）可以在[这里](https://files.lakejason0.ml/images/3/34/%E5%94%B1%E7%89%87%E6%9B%BF%E6%8D%A2.zip)获得。

### 不死图腾替换

该资源包将不死图腾替换成了自定义模型。自定义模型范围为 `10800000~10800006` 。如果这不适用于你（例如模型出错，游玩自定义地图或装载其他3D资源包），你可以尝试调整载入顺序，或者下载不带自定义模型的预设构建（以 `_nofigure` 结尾）。如果不想重新下载，你也可以直接删除有自定义模型版本的对应的文件夹。

关于可以直接获取自定义模型的数据包，可以在[这里](https://files.lakejason0.ml/images/e/e5/Figure.zip)，或是在本repo中的`datapack`目录找到。

### “Suitable for work”替换

我们十分理解，一些字符串可能并不适合公开场合的使用。因此为了规避，请在自己构建时在命令结尾加入参数 `--sfw` 以获取一个更加安全的版本。

## 鹦鹉通道

### 体验最新内容

想要**抢先体验**最前沿~~整活~~版本，我们强烈建议您前往[网页打包](https://dl.meme.teahou.se/)，那里可以更直观地选择您需要的内容。

若您仍想自己尝试从命令行打包（并不推荐，比较繁琐），可按以下步骤进行：

#### 先决条件

请确保已经安装了NodeJS主流版本和Git。如果没有，请到[NodeJS官网](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/)和[Git官网](https://www.git-scm.com)下载。

#### 步骤

1. 下载源码；
2. 进入文件夹；
3. 安装相关依赖；
4. 运行预设打包命令。

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/mcwzh-meme-resourcepack.git
cd mcwzh-meme-resourcepack
npm install
node preset_build.js
```

在 `builds` 文件夹中会生成 `mcwzh-meme.zip` 、 `mcwzh-meme_compatible_sfw.zip` 、 `mcwzh-meme_compatible_nofigure_legacy_sfw.zip` 等预设的资源包，名称和作用如上所述。

### 自助跟进游戏版本

此资源包的语言文件顺序与原版的英文顺序并不一致（本资源包是将key按照字母顺序排序）。如果原版的英文译名跟进了，请先将解包的英文语言文件按照前文所述排序，可以参考[这个网站](https://tool.funsmall.cn/jsonsort/)或本repo中的 `sort.py`。推荐使用[Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)的比较功能以方便查看新字符串。

梗体中文本体文件也可以使用 `sort.py` 进行排序。

如果你是Crowdin上Minecraft项目的翻译者，你也可以随时查看通知来获取新字符串。

![Release](https://github.com/bangbang93/minecraft-proxy/workflows/Release/badge.svg)
![Testing](https://github.com/bangbang93/minecraft-proxy/workflows/Testing/badge.svg)

反向代理Minecraft，完整支持Forge，支持正版登录。若后端服务器是Spigot或者Cauldron，可以通过spigot.yml启用bungeecord模式来获取正确的客户端IP

## 和BungeeCord的区别
minecraft-proxy更像NGINX。
BungeeCord的目标是把多个Minecraft实例用起来像一个，minecraft-proxy的目标是让多个Minecraft实例共享25565端口，就像http应用的虚拟主机。

![console example](https://i.imgur.com/T5e73jP.png)


## Development

This section details the setup of a basic developmentment environment.

### Getting Started

**System Requirements**

* [Node.js][nodejs] v16

---

**Clone and Install Dependencies**

```console
> git clone https://github.com/dscalzi/HeliosLauncher.git
> cd HeliosLauncher
> npm install
```

---

**Launch Application**

```console
> npm start
```

---

**Build Installers**

To build for your current platform.

```console
> npm run dist
```

Build for a specific platform.

| Platform    | Command              |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Windows x64 | `npm run dist:win`   |
| macOS       | `npm run dist:mac`   |
| Linux x64   | `npm run dist:linux` |

Builds for macOS may not work on Windows/Linux and vice-versa.

---

### Visual Studio Code

All development of the launcher should be done using [Visual Studio Code][vscode].

Paste the following into `.vscode/launch.json`

```JSON
{
  ""version"": ""0.2.0"",
  ""configurations"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""Debug Main Process"",
      ""type"": ""node"",
      ""request"": ""launch"",
      ""cwd"": ""${workspaceFolder}"",
      ""program"": ""${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/electron/cli.js"",
      ""args"" : ["".""],
      ""outputCapture"": ""std""
    },
    {
      ""name"": ""Debug Renderer Process"",
      ""type"": ""chrome"",
      ""request"": ""launch"",
      ""runtimeExecutable"": ""${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/electron"",
      ""windows"": {
        ""runtimeExecutable"": ""${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd""
      },
      ""runtimeArgs"": [
        ""${workspaceFolder}/."",
        ""--remote-debugging-port=9222""
      ],
      ""webRoot"": ""${workspaceFolder}""
    }
  ]
}
```

This adds two debug configurations.

#### Debug Main Process

This allows you to debug Electron's [main process][mainprocess]. You can debug scripts in the [renderer process][rendererprocess] by opening the DevTools Window.

#### Debug Renderer Process

This allows you to debug Electron's [renderer process][rendererprocess]. This requires you to install the [Debugger for Chrome][chromedebugger] extension.

Note that you **cannot** open the DevTools window while using this debug configuration. Chromium only allows one debugger, opening another will crash the program.

226,martinohanlon/minecraft-stuff,Python,"=========================
Minecraft - Stuff Library
=========================

An extension library of useful 'stuff' (aka classes) I have created for Minecraft: Pi Edition's API.  

It provides functions for drawing lines, creating, moving and rotating shapes and a pretty cool turtle.  Check out the `documentation`_ and `examples`_.

|minecraftstuff|

Created by `Martin O'Hanlon`_, `@martinohanlon`_, `stuffaboutco.de`_.

Install
=========================

Open a terminal and run the following commands::

    sudo pip install minecraftstuff
    sudo pip3 install minecraftstuff

Code
=========================

See the `documentation`_ for more information, but below is a summary.

MinecraftDrawing
-------------------------

::

    from minecraftstuff import MinecraftDrawing
    from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
    from mcpi import block

    #Connect to minecraft
    mc = Minecraft.create()
    # get the players position
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()

    #Using the Minecraft Drawing API

229,montoyo/mcef,Java,"# MCEF
Minecraft Chromium Embedded Framework (MCEF) is an API to allow Minecraft Modders to add custom web browsers into Minecraft.
The project was initialy made for WebDisplays (www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1291044-web-displays-browse-on-the-internet-in-minecraft).
It is based on JCEF (https://code.google.com/p/javachromiumembedded/), which is based on CEF (https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/java-cef) which is based on chromium (http://www.chromium.org).

# Features
- 2D & 3D web view rendering (not only in GUIs)
- Java -> JavaScript (IBrowser.runJavaScript)
- JavaScript -> Java (IJSQueryHandler)
- Embedded files (mod://modname/file.html => /assets/modname/html/file.html)
- HTML5, CSS3 are supported.

# What can I do with this?
- If you're tired of Minecraft's GuiScreen, you can make a HTML/JS/CSS GUI.
- Open a link to your wiki.
- Whatever you want, but please not a WebDisplays clone.

# Currently supported platforms
Right now MCEF supports Windows 32 and 64 bits. I'll compile JCEF for linux as soon as possible. However I can't compile it for Mac.
If you want to compile the natives for Mac, you can follow the instructions here: https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/java-cef/wiki/BranchesAndBuilding

# For players
This is the Github project of MCEF; here you can only read the source code of it.
You can download the mod in its latest version from here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2324969-minecraft-chromium-embedded-framework-mcef

# For modders
**DONT** copy the net.montoyo.mcef.api package into your project. Instead, download the latest API release from https://github.com/montoyo/mcef/releases and put it in the libs folder. Users will have to download the mod from the MinecraftForum thread.
To understand how it works, you may look at the net.montoyo.mcef.example package, which demos:
* The IBrowser interface, how to draw it and control it
* The IJSQueryHandler interface, how to handle JavaScript queries
* The IDisplayHandler interface, how to handle browser URL changes
* How to use the mod:// scheme

# For forkers
Don't forget to add ""-Dfml.coreMods.load=net.montoyo.mcef.coremod.ShutdownPatcher"" to the VM options, otherwise the Java process will hang forever!

# BedwarsRel - Minecraft Bedwars Plugin
![](https://github.com/BedwarsRel/BedwarsRel/blob/master/logo.png)

Bedwars is a [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net) minigame where teams (max. 15) try to destroy the other teams' beds. But there is more: On the whole map there are ressource spawners spawning items. Some items are more worth than others and with these you can buy different things in the so called ""Villager Shop"". You will find powerful weapons or potions or simple blocks to get to the other bases. Get to the others bases? Yes, every team starts on an island and you have to get to the others with blocks which you can buy in the ""Villager Shop"". When you meet a enemy you have to try to kill him so he'll lose all the equipment which he had in his inventory. As soon as a team's bed is destroyed they cannot respawn again and last team standing wins.

# Server Owners

# A bedrock Minecraft PE Server on Docker

This documentation is for image lomot/minecraft-bedrock:1.19.51.01

## Start the server

#### 1. Install Docker in your server

```bash
apt install docker.io
```

or you can follow this documentation : [How to install Docker]

#### 2. Create a folder for server data

This folder is for your world data and some configuration files, it contains `permissions.json`,`server.properties`,`allowlist.json`,`worlds`, if you use an empty folder, all the files will be created automatically, for example `/opt/mcpe-data`

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/mcpe-data
```

#### 3. Deploy the server

```bash
docker run -itd --restart=always --name=mcpe --net=host \
  -v /opt/mcpe-data:/data \
  lomot/minecraft-bedrock:1.19.51.01
```

## Upgrade the server

#### 1. Backup your data

Backup the folder `/opt/mcpe-data`

```bash
cp -r /opt/mcpe-data /opt/mcpe-data.bak
```

#### 2. Exit and delete the old container

```bash
docker container stop mcpe
docker container rm mcpe
```

#### 3. Start a new container

```bash
docker run -itd --restart=always --name=mcpe --net=host \
  -v /opt/mcpe-data:/data \
  lomot/minecraft-bedrock:1.19.51.01
```

## Manage the server

### Enter or quit the game console

```bash
docker attach mcpe
```

To quit, press `ctrl + p + q`

Use `ctrl + c` or `ctrl + d`to kill the process

### Use this command to stop/start/restart/rm the server

```bash
docker container stop/start/restart/rm mcpe
```

### Change the server port

To change the server port, update `server-port` in the file`server.properties`

Using bridge networks will decrease the network performance, it is supposed to use host networks.

### About addons, behavior_packs and resource_packs

There are too many files about addons to configure, so I made another image, to use this image, you need to manage server folder by yourself, such as update and configuration files, you can download the server files here [Minecraft server].

How to use:

```bash
docker run -itd --restart=always --name=mcpe --net=host \
  -v /opt/mcpe-data:/mcpe \
  lomot/minecraft-bedrock:base
```

236,Railcraft/Railcraft,Java,"# Railcraft - A Minecraft Mod

Here you will find the source and issue tracker for the **Official Railcraft Project**.


## What is Railcraft?

Railcraft is a mod written for the hit game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/). It is built on top of the [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge) API.

It greatly expands and improves the Minecart system in Minecraft. Adding many new blocks, entities, and features. It has been in development since 2012 and contains over 800 class files and hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

The mod was created and is still currently maintained by the user going by the name **CovertJaguar**.

## Why are you posting the Source Code?

In the words of **CovertJaguar**:
> As a new modder, I originally feared losing control of my code, my brainchild. However, since that time, I have had the privelege of being Project Lead on two other major Minecraft Mod projects that provided access to the source: [Buildcraft](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft) and [Forestry](https://github.com/ForestryMC/ForestryMC). I've generally found this to be a positive experience resulting in many bug fixes and increased intermod compatibility.  While I still have some concerns, I have come to feel that the benefits of providing others access to my source code outweigh the negatives and unknowns. To that end, despite my misgivings, I made Source Access a [Patreon Milestone Goal](http://www.patreon.com/CovertJaguar). I had no idea whether I'd ever meet that Goal, but I decided to let the community decide, and decide they did, overwhelmingly so! My Patrons are awesome. So, as promised, I am posting the Source Code.

## Issues

Post only confirmed bugs [here](https://github.com/CovertJaguar/Railcraft/issues). Do not post crash logs, you can post pastebin links to FML logs, but no crash logs.

You must have read and performed the proper support procedure outlined [here](http://railcraft.info/wiki/info:support) before posting.

More information about issue Labels can be found [here](https://github.com/CovertJaguar/Railcraft/wiki/Issue-Labels).

## Contributing

The Official Railcraft Project welcomes contributions from anyone, provided they have signed the Contributor Licensing Agreement (CLA) found [here](https://cla-assistant.io/CovertJaguar/Railcraft).

Signing the CLA is simple, just follow the link, and hit the ""I Agree"" button and you are good to go.

Regarding new features/behavior changes, please submit a Suggestion Issue to the Tracker before you write a single line of code. Keeping everyone on the same page saves time and effort and reduces negative experiences all around when a change turns out to be controversial.

Also, as a bonus. If you submit a Pull Request that ends up being merged you are eligible to receive beta access. To redeem, contact CovertJaguar on IRC.

## Building

The Railcraft Project follows standard Forge conventions for setting up and building a project, with a couple additional details (details to come).

You can create a gradle.properties file in the project root with the following properties:
```
mcUsername=Steve
mcPassword=ILoveNotch
```

Initial Setup from the Command Line:
```
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```

The [API](https://github.com/CovertJaguar/Railcraft-API) and [Localization](https://github.com/CovertJaguar/Railcraft-Localization) files reside in their own repositories and are pulled automatically into the main repo as git submodules. You will however need to run the following commands:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

For more information on setting up an Intellij modding environement see cpw's video:
https://youtu.be/G2aPT36kf60

To build, run:
```
gradlew build
```

# Wisdom
“Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place where gold is refined. Iron is taken from the earth, And copper is smelted from ore.

Man puts an end to darkness, And searches every recess for ore in the darkness and the shadow of creepers. He breaks open a shaft away from villages; In places forgotten by feet they dig far away from villagers; They jump to and fro.

As for the earth, from it comes bread, But underneath it is turned up by fire and lava; Its stones are the source of emeralds, And it contains redstone dust. That path no bird knows, Nor has the parrot’s eye seen it. The proud ocelot has not trodden it, Nor has the fierce wolf passed over it.

He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the roots. He cuts out channels in the rocks, And his eye sees every precious thing. He dams up the streams from trickling; What is hidden he brings forth to light.

But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? Man does not know its value, Nor is it found in the Nether or the End. The void says, ‘It is not in me’; And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’ It cannot be purchased for gold, Nor can silver be weighed for its price. It cannot be valued in stars, in precious obsidian or the heart of the sea. Neither gold nor crystal can equal it, Nor can it be exchanged for jewelry of fine gold. No mention shall be made of coral or quartz, For the price of wisdom is above emeralds. Lapis Lazuli cannot equal it, Nor can it be valued in ingots of gold.

From where then does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding? It is hidden from the eyes of all living, And concealed from the birds of the air. If you search through the bones and question the dead, they say, 'we've heard only rumors of it.'

God understands its way, And He knows its place. For He looks to the ends of the earth, And sees under the whole heavens, To establish a weight for the wind, And apportion the waters by measure. When He made a law for the rain, And a path for the thunderbolt, Then He saw wisdom and declared it; He prepared it, indeed, He searched it out.

And to man He said, ‘Behold, the reverence and love of the Lord, that is wisdom, And to depart from evil is understanding.’ ”

`mcpi` Python library for communicating with [Minecraft: Pi edition](https://minecraft.net/en-us/edition/pi/) and [RaspberryJuice](https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice).

## Installation

### Windows

```
pip3 install mcpi
```

### Linux / MacOS

```bash
sudo pip3 install mcpi
```

## History

The [Minecraft: Pi edition](https://minecraft.net/en-us/edition/pi/) Python library was originally created by Mojang and released with Minecraft: Pi edition.

Initial supported was provided for Python 2 only, but during a sprint at PyconUK 2014 it was migrated to Python 3 and [py3minepi](https://github.com/py3minepi/py3minepi) was created.

The ability to hack Minecraft from Python was very popular and the [RaspberryJuice](https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice) plugin was created for Minecraft Java edition. RaspberryJuice also extended the API adding additional features.

This python library supports Python 2 & 3 and Minecraft: Pi edition and RaspberryJuice.

Documentation for the Minecraft: Pi edition and RaspberryJuice API's can be found at [www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft-api-reference.html](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft-api-reference.html).

It was released onto [PyPI](https://pypi.org) in May 2018.

=========

This readme is intended for developers. For downloads and gameplay instructions please see the [official website](http://www.vivecraft.org/)


Using this Repository
========
 
 Vivecraft uses patches to avoid distributing Minecraft code. The build scripts are in Python 2.X.
 
 - Fork, checkout or download the repo using your Git method of choice.
 - Install Java JDK 1.8. The Java JRE will NOT work.
 - Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK directory
 - Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to your PATH environment variable
 - Install Python 2.7.x (NOT 3.x). Be sure to tick the 'add python to your PATH' option during install. [Download from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - Open a command prompt and navigate to the repo directory
 - Run install.bat
 
The install process (install.py) does a number of things:
 - It downloads MCP (Minecraft coder's pack) and extracts it to the \mcp9xx\ directory.
 - It downloads a ton of dependencies.
 - It merges Optifine into vanilla minecraft jar.
 - It decompiles and deobfuscates the combined minecraft/optifine into \mcp9xx\src\.minecraft_orig_nofix\
 - It applies any patches found in \mcppatches\ and copies the result to\mcp9xx\src\.minecraft_orig\
 - It applies all the patches found in \patches\ and copies the result to \mcp9xx\src\minecraft\. 
 - It copies all code files found in \src\ to \mcp9xx\src\minecraft\. 
 - It copies all files found in \assets\ to \mcp9xx\src\assets\.
 This directory is now the full 'Vivecraft' codebase.
 
If you use Eclipse you can open the workspace found in \mcp9xx\eclipse. You will have to correct the library path for the vanilla jar and realms jar, and also add libraries for JRift, json, asm, and launchwrapper, all of these can be found in the root /lib folder. To run the game from eclipse you also have to attach natives to the lwjgl jar (from lib/natives).

Make all changes to the game in the \mcp9xx\src\minecraft directory.

To update code to Github:
========
 - run getchanges.bat. This compares mcp9xx\src\minecraft to mcp9xx\src\minecraft_orig. patches are generated for modified files and copied to \patches\. Whole new files are copied to \src\.
 - Push to Github.
 
To build an installer:
========
 - run build.bat. This runs getchanges, build, and then create_install. Basically it takes the new files and patches and creates a jar. And then it uses the code and jsons found in \installer\ to make an installer.exe.

To update changes from github
========
  - After pulling changes from github run applychanges.bat. This backs up mcp9xx\src\minecraft to mcp9xx\src\minecraft_bak, and starts over by applying all patches in \patches\ to mcp9xx\src\minecraft_orig, and copies the result o mcp9xx\src\minecraft
  
Caveats - Maintaining Forge Compatibility
========
When Vivecraft is run with Forge, any public method can be called by any mod, and any vanilla class is up for grabs for ASM modification. To this end, please follow these guidelines in writing Vivecraft code:
 - Do not rename any vanilla methods, fields, or classes
 - Do not change the type or signatures of any vanilla members.
 - Keep modification to vanilla methods minimal, move code to your own methods, preferrably in your own files.

Additionally, vivecraft does not use bytecode manipulation at runtime to modify the vanilla classes (mostly), it replaces them wholesale in much the same way as optifine. It only replaces files that have been modified by the user, and it replaces them after Forge and Optifine have made their modifications to them. This means that any vanilla class you modify will NOT have any of Forge's code changes made to it at runtime. To fix this, the class must have all Forge's method calls added via reflection in Vivecraft. Optifine uses this method extensively and Vivecraft expands it. 

Before making ANY changes to a vanilla class file you should check to see:
  - Is the class already modified by Vivecraft? You can tell if there is a .patch file for it on github. If so: feel free to make any other changes.
  - Is the class already modified by Optifine? You can tell because there will usually be calls to Reflector.java. If Optifine has already made the Reflection calls, continue with your edits.
  - Is the class modfied by Forge? - Check Forge's github patches to see, Forge modifies many base classes but not all. If the class is not modified by Forge, feel free to edit it.
  - If the class is modified by Forge, and neither Vivecraft, nor Optifine have added the Reflection calls, you will have to do so along with your own changes. See Reflector.java for numerous examples.

## Prerequisites
* [Java] 8

## Clone
The following steps will ensure your project is cloned properly.

1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/SpongePowered/Sponge.git`
2. `cd Sponge`
3. `cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks`

## Setup
**Note**: Sponge uses [Gradle] as its build system. The repo includes the Gradle wrapper that will automatically download the correct Gradle 
version. Local installations of Gradle may work (as long as they are using Gradle 6.8+) but are untested. To execute the Gradle wrapper, run the 
`./gradlew` script on Unix systems or only `gradlew` on Windows systems.

To have browsable sources for use in-IDE, run `./gradlew :decompile`. This command will need to be re-ran after any change to
Minecraft version or to `.accesswidener` files. If sources are not appearing properly, an IDE refresh should fix things.

### IDE Setup
__For [Eclipse]__
 1. Make sure the Buildship plugin is installed (available on the [Eclipse Marketplace])
 2. Import the project as an *Existing Gradle Project* (via File > Import > Gradle)

While we do our best to support any IDE, most of our developers use IntelliJ, so issues may pop up with Eclipse from time to time.
We'll be happy to work to resolve those issues if reported via [our issues page][Issues] or fixed via PR.

__For [IntelliJ]__
  1. Make sure you have the Gradle plugin enabled (File > Settings > Plugins).  
  2. Click File > New > Project from Existing Sources > Gradle and select the root folder for Sponge.
  3. Make sure _Use default gradle wrapper_ is selected. Older/newer Gradle versions may work but we only test using the wrapper.

For both Eclipse and IntelliJ, a variety of run configurations will be generated which allow running the client and server in development. These run 
configurations will be re-generated on each project import, so any desired modifications should be done on copies of the configurations.

While these run configurations have Java versions attached to them, be aware that IntelliJ ignores that information entirely, and Eclipse will 
only be able to align those java versions with whatever JREs it is aware of.

## Building

In order to build Sponge you simply need to run the `gradlew build` command. On Windows systems you should run `gradlew build` instead 
of `./gradlew build` to invoke the Gradle wrapper. You can find the compiled JAR files in `./build/libs` and `./vanilla/build/libs`.

## Updating your Clone
The following steps will update your clone with the official repo.

1. `git pull`
2. `git submodule update --recursive`
3. `./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies`

245,Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed,Python,"# Vanilla-Normals-Renewed
A shaders compatible minecraft texture pack, based on vanilla but with normals and proper glossiness information.
This resourcepack is compatible with both the ""oldPBR"" and ""labPBR"" standards, and should work correctly with most shaders.

⚠️ This version is made for Minecraft 1.16 and above ⚠️

**For the easy download (2 versions late) just go to ""Releases"" 👉**

## Description

I didn't want any of those fancy high-resolution texture packs in order to enjoy normal mapping and specular highlights.
So I decided to make my own, but based on vanilla textures.

This texture pack is free for everyone to use! However if you wish to support me, you can join my Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/Poudingue

## Copyright

You can do whatever you want with my texture pack, screenshots, videos, modifications for personal use or redistribution, as long as you don't sell it and provide a link to this page or my Patreon page. Oh, and also, don't mix it with Realistico. Dead serious. Absolutely not a joke. This is not irony, I really insist. I will sue you. 

## Screenshots

⚠️ The screenshots provided here were made with SEUS renewed, an an old version of minecraft, the results will differ with other shaders ⚠️

Textures have bump mapping information, allowing parallax occlusion mapping and normal mapping.
Smoothness information is very important for the credibility of materials too, especially when the sun lights it at grazing angles.

![Normals and smoothness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18035775/64910219-244f3800-d714-11e9-9101-7651afb13ced.png)
Screenshot taken in SEUS renewed 1.0

Metals and smooth materials now have the correct information to compute reflections.
SEUS renewed heavily relies on Screen Space Reflections for this and don't take correctly roughness surfaces for it, so the reflections may be too shiny and imperfect. However using SEUS PTGI will provide Path-Traced reflections and indirect lighting, and correctly take into account roughness.

![Metal and smooth materials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18035775/64910220-2618fb80-d714-11e9-9315-f0c6e72ff281.png)
Screenshot taken in SEUS PTGI E9

## Installation

- Install a shader supporting normal and specular mapping. If you don't know which one, give this one a shot : https://sonicether.com/seus/ and if you want raytracing, it should also work properly with SEUS PTGI HRR : https://www.patreon.com/sonicether

### BRAND NEW zip-based Method (if you don't know how to use git)

1. On this page, click on «Release», on the top of the screen.
2. Pick the version you want and download the zip in the «assets» zone.
2. Go to the minecraft folder
    - For windows, go to ""%appdata%/.minecraft"" on your start menu.
    - For Linux, go to ""~/.minecraft"" in your file explorer.
    - For Mac OS, go to ""~/Library/Application Support/minecraft"" in your file explorer
3. Go into the «resourcepacks» folder. Create it if it doesn't exist
4. Put the zip you downloaded here.
5. Select the right shader and resourcepack in minecraft options.
6. (for PTGI and other shaderpacks needing resolution adjustment) : set ""Texture resolution"" to ×16
7. Enjoy !

### GIT powered Install Method (

Git is a version control software that github uses to manage all the code that they host, which can be used to make installation really easy.
Version Control software allows multiple authors to collaborate, and track all the changes made, and who made what changes

#### Linux Git Install
    1. To do this, you will first need to open a terminal window
    2. Then verify that git is installed by running `git --version` This will make sure that it is installed, and additionally, show what version is installed
        - If you get an output that looks like `git version 2.21.0` then it is installed.
        - If you get an output like this `bash: git: command not found` (Different shells will appear different, but most will basically state that the command wasn't found.) Different Distros have different approaches to installing software, if you're having trouble look up ""<insert Linux Distro Here> Install git""
    3. Once you have certified git is installed, move your terminal to the folder `~/.minecraft/resourcepacks` by running `cd ~/.minecraft/resourcepacks`
    4. After you're in the right folder, run 'git clone https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed.git` to clone the entire repository to your computer.
        - You will not need to zip the repo to have it work, Minecraft can handle unzipped texture packs.

##### Linux Git Update
    1. Please have installed the texture pack using the above guide. This won't work if you went on github, downloaded the Zip, and extracted it.
    2. Open up a terminal
    3. Change to the TEXTURE PACK'S folder by running `cd ~/.minecraft/resourcepacks/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed`
    4. Run `git pull origin' to download the latest version.
        - You might want to relaunch Minecraft after this to make sure it uses the latest textures.


#### Windows Git Install
    1. Install Git and add to the path (don't' worry there is a guide below)
        1. Open a web browser and [download](https://git-scm.com/download/win) the latest version of git
        2. Run the installer
            - When it comes to the ""Adjusting your PATH environment"" the middle option is recommended, as it allow for more flexibility, but doesn't cause problems.
            - When it comes to the ""Configuring the line ending conventions"", set it to ""Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings""
                - Linux and Windows use different line ending in text files, and this will prevent any problems.
            - When it comes to the "" Configuring the Terminal Emulator to use with Git Bash"" the Windows one is sufficient for most work
        3. Once it is installed, launch command prompt
            - Press the Windows key + ""R"", to open a run box, then type in cmd.exe, and press enter
        4. Change to the resourcepack folder using the command  `cd %AppData%/.minecraft/resourcepacks`
        5. Clone the repository to your computer by running git clone https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed.git
            - You will not need to zip the repo to have it work, Minecraft can handle unzipped texture packs.

##### Windows Git Update
    1. Please have installed the texture pack using the above guide. This won't work if you went on github, downloaded the Zip, and extracted it.
    2. Open up command prompt
        - Press the Windows key + ""R"", to open a run box, then type in cmd.exe, and press enter
    3. Change to the TEXTURE PACK'S folder by running `cd %appdata%/.minecraft/resourcepacks/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed`
    4. Then run `git pull origin' to download the latest version.
        - You might want to relaunch Minecraft after this to make sure it uses the latest textures.

```

To update, run `go get` with the `-u` option.

Requires `csfml` libraries and headers to build.

## What works

* Connecting to servers
* Online mode
* Rendering most blocks
* Block model support

## What doesn't work

* 99% of Minecraft's features

## Running

### Via the Offical Minecraft launcher

![Profile example](http://i.imgur.com/NBMGhPL.png)

You need to create a new profile (or edit an existing one) on the Minecraft 
launcher and modify the profile to look like the above but replace the path
to steven with the location you built it at or downloaded it too and change the 
`server` parameter to the target server. Currently only works in online mode
(with no plans for offline mode currently). If the `server` parameter isn't
passed then a server list will be displayed.

### Standalone

Just running steven via a double click (Windows) or `./steven` (everything else)
will bring up a login screen followed by a server list which you can select a server
from.

Providing a username, uuid and access token via the command line as followed:
  `--username <username> --uuid <uuid> --accessToken <access token>`
will skip the login screen and jump straight to the server list. Providing a
server address via `--server <server>:<port>` will skip the server list and 
connect straight to the server. As it currently stands providing all the arguments
allows for the client to parallelise connecting to the server and loading the 
textures/models/other assets as a 'quick connect'.

* [Issues]
* [Documentation]
* [Community Discord]
* [Community IRC]: [#sponge on irc.esper.net]
* [Development IRC]: [#spongedev on irc.esper.net]
* [Preparing for Development]

## Prerequisites
* [Java] 8

## Cloning
The following steps will ensure your project is cloned properly.

1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeVanilla.git`
2. `cd SpongeVanilla`
3. `cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks`

**Note**: If you accidentally omit `--recursive` option when cloning, you may
delete the repository and try again, or you may execute the following to fix the
situation:

	git submodule update --init --recursive

## Setup
**Note**: SpongeVanilla uses [Gradle] as its build system. The repo includes the Gradle wrapper that will automatically download the correct Gradle 
version. Local installations of Gradle may work but are untested. To execute the Gradle wrapper, run the `./gradlew` script on Unix systems or only
`gradlew` on Windows systems.

Before you are able to build SpongeVanilla, you must first prepare the environment:

  - Run `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies`

### IDE Setup
__For [Eclipse]__
  1. Run `./gradlew eclipse`
  2. Import SpongeVanilla as an existing project (File > Import > General)
  3. Select the root folder for SpongeVanilla and make sure `Search for nested projects` is enabled
  4. Check SpongeVanilla when it finishes building and click **Finish**

__For [IntelliJ]__
  1. Make sure you have the Gradle plugin enabled (File > Settings > Plugins. For **macOS** users: IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences > Plugins).  
  2. Click File > New > Project from Existing Sources > Gradle and select the root folder for SpongeVanilla.
  3. Make sure _Use default gradle wrapper_ is selected. Older/newer Gradle versions may work but we only test using the wrapper.

## Running
__Note:__ The following is aimed to help you setup run configurations for Eclipse and IntelliJ, if you do not want to be able to run SpongeVanilla directly from your IDE then you can skip this.

__For [Eclipse]__ 
  1. Running `./gradlew eclipse` should have generated the run configurations automatically.
  2. When launching the server for the first time, it will shutdown by itself. You will need to modify eula.txt to set eula=true (this means you agree to the Mojang EULA, if you do not wish to do this then you cannot run the server).

__For [IntelliJ]__
  1. Run `./gradlew genIntelliJRuns`
  2. Restart IntelliJ IDEA or reload the project, the run configuration should now be generated.
  3. When launching the server for the first time, it will shutdown by itself. You will need to modify eula.txt to set eula=true (this means you agree to the Mojang EULA, if you do not wish to do this then you cannot run the server).

## Building
__Note:__ You must [setup the environment](#setup) before you can build SpongeVanilla.

In order to build SpongeVanilla you simply need to run the `gradlew` command. On Windows systems you should run `gradlew` instead of `./gradlew` to
invoke the Gradle wrapper. You can find the compiled JAR files in `./build/libs`. You can find the compiled JAR files in `./build/libs` but in most cases
you'll only need 'spongevanilla-x.x.x-x.x-x.jar'.

## Updating your Clone
The following steps will update your clone with the official repo.

1. `git pull`
2. `git submodule update --recursive`
3. `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies`

## FAQ
__A dependency was added, but my IDE is missing it! How do I add it?__
>If a new dependency was added, you can just restart your IDE and the Gradle plugin for that IDE should pull in the new dependencies.

## Contributing
Are you a talented programmer looking to contribute some code? We'd love the help!
* Open a pull request with your changes, following our [guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Please follow the above guidelines for your pull request(s) to be accepted.

__Help! Things are not working!__
>Some issues can be resolved by deleting the '.gradle' folder in your user directory and running through the setup steps again, or even running `gradle cleanCache` and running through the setup again. Otherwise if you are having trouble with something that the README does not cover, feel free to join our IRC channel and ask for assistance.

251,ljyloo/LevelDb2Avnil,Java,"# THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED. YOU ARE WELCOMED TO FORK OR PULL REQUEST, BUT I WILL NOT MAINTAIN THE CODE ANYMORE, SORRY.

# LevelDb2Anvil

Convert **Minecraft: Pocket Edition Maps(_LevelDB_)** to **Minecraft Maps(_Anvil_)**.

## Info:

Latest version(v2.0) works for maps generated by Minecraft: Pocket Edition 1.0 or later.

Blocks have different ID in PC and PE will be converted into correct ID, no worry.

For Minecraft: Pocket Edition before v1.0 and after v0.9, consider using last build(v1.0).

Any question, bug or advice, feel free to talk with me at [here](https://github.com/ljyloo/LevelDb2Avnil/issues).

## Known Issues:

- ~~Block light and sky light will always be 15 (Still don't know how to get the data from Mojang's LevelDB database so I just set it 15)~~
  Checkout [here](https://github.com/ljyloo/LevelDb2Avnil/pull/19)
- **No entities**
- **Player will not spawn at the same coordinate like before**
- **Items in the chest will disappear**
- ~~No biome~~
- **Lag when first time load**
- **Crash(super rare!)**

## Usage:

### Video tutorial
There's a video tutorial about this(Made by AntVenom): [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFAkc5L4h48)

### Auto script
Import your LevelDB world in and rename it to the name 'world'.
Run start.bat(if you're on Windows) or start.sh(if you're on OS X or Linux) and the converter will now convert it to Anvil format to the output folder of 'worldanvil'.

### Command line interface
If you were familiar with command line interface, using the Converter.jar like this(You may want to [install java runtime first](java.com)): 

```
java -jar Converter.jar <import folder> <export folder>
```

## Todo

- [ ] **Fix light data**
- [ ] **Fix player coordinate**
- [ ] **Fix entities**
- [ ] **Fix items contained in the chest**
- [x] **Fix biome**
- [x] **Refactor the code**
- [ ] **Graphical user interface**

## Screenshots:

The mca files generated by the program stores your maps data. They can be found in an usual Minecraft world folder:

![](pic/saves_folder.jpg)
![](pic/region_folder.jpg)

Create a superflat new world and copy the mca files into it, open the game and locate your chunks.(Press F3 to see your location)
Don't worry if you were seeing the flat chunks again, the coordinate of your original chunk in the MCPE is exactly the same in here too, you may want to use teleport command to find the chunks.

## Credits:

This program uses leveldb by tinfoiled. See lisense [here](https://github.com/ljyloo/leveldb)

This program contains code from Mojang: source at [here](https://mojang.com/2012/02/new-minecraft-map-format-anvil/)

User-friendly start.bat/start.sh, the folder 'worldanvil' was by @keithkfng.

Thanks AntVenom for making a video tutorial.

by Jamie Bainbridge <<jamie.bainbridge@gmail.com>>

This is an initscript to run a Minecraft or CraftBukkit server on CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu.

### Note

As of 2015, this script is no longer actively maintained. All the supported distros are moving to systemd, making the concept of an LSB initscript rather outdated. All issues I see are related to bugs in Ubuntu's implementation of Upstart, it works perfectly on CentOS. However I think you are much better learning to use containers like Docker to control a single process and its files. There are many instructions around the internet on how to do this.

Thanks to all supporters over the years. You are welcome to fork this repo if you wish to continue development.

### Features

*   Start, stop, restart CraftBukkit as a system service
*   Automatic (via cron) and manual logfile rotation
*   Automatic (via cron) and manual backups
*   Backup compression and rotation (keeps 7 days worth of backups)
*   Allows use of third-party backup solutions
*   Check latest Recommended Build and update to it if required
*   Information display including Java path, current memory usage, current TCP connections
*   Able to run multiple separate instances of the server at once

### Supported Distributions

*   CentOS 6, CentOS 5, Fedora 14 (probably works on Fedora Core 6 and later, untested)
*   Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS

Other distros which use SysV Init or Upstart will probably work.

Distros using systemd (Fedora 15+, Arch Linux, etc) may not work.

### Requirements

*   `screen`, `rsync`

    (you may need to install these)

*   `bash`, `chkconfig` or `sysv-rc`, `coreutils`, `cronie`, `curl`, `diffutils`, `grep`, `initscripts`, `net-tools`, `procps`, `tar`

  (these should all be installed by default)

*   Oracle Java 7

*   Enough disk space to save your map twice, plus another ~5 times for a week of compressed backup space.

  ie: If your map is 1Gb then you probably need at least 7Gb, plus any space your plugins require and any additional backups you'll be making.

### Installation

As the root user:

*   Install Sun Java (CentOS/Fedora)

    Download the RPM from <http://www.java.com/>

    `yum localinstall jre-<version>.rpm`

*   Install Sun Java (Ubuntu)

    ~~~
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
    ~~~

*   Confirm your JVM installation

    ~~~
    java -version
    ~~~

*   Create a new user with a home directory

    ~~~
    useradd -m bukkit
    ~~~
    
*   Save the script as `/etc/init.d/minecraft` and make it executable

    ~~~
    chmod +x /etc/init.d/minecraft
    ~~~
    
*   Copy between the `<<COMMENT` and `COMMENT` lines and place the copy at `/etc/default/minecraft`

    If you need to edit settings, edit the `/etc/default/minecraft` file, not the initscript

*   Allow the bukkit user to run the init script without needing root access

    Type `visudo` and add this line to the bottom:

    ~~~
    bukkit localhost=NOPASSWD:/etc/init.d/minecraft*
    ~~~

*   Create an alias so you only have to type `minecraft` to run the script

    Add the following line to both root and bukkit's `~/.bashrc` file:

    ~~~
    alias minecraft='/etc/init.d/minecraft'
    ~~~

*   Start the server on system boot if desired (CentOS/Fedora)
  
    ~~~
    chkconfig --add minecraft
    chkconfig minecraft on
    ~~~

*   Start the server on system boot if desired (Ubuntu)

    ~~~
    update-rc.d minecraft defaults
    ~~~

As the regular user, bukkit:

*   Make the required paths

    ~~~
    mkdir -p ~/backups && mkdir -p ~/craftbukkit
    ~~~

*   Put your `craftbukkit.jar`, world, plugins, `server.properties`, etc into `~/craftbukkit`

### Backups

*   Create cron jobs to do regular backups and rotations around 4am

    Type `crontab -e` to open the cron interface and add the following

    ~~~
     0 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft backup              # backup world at 4:00am
     5 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft logrotate           # rotate logs at 4:05am
    15 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft removeoldbackups    # remove old backups at 4:30am
    ~~~

*   If you have multiple worlds, you can pass the worldname as a parameter to the regular backup

    ~~~
     0 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft backup world1       # backup world1 at 4:00am
     5 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft logrotate           # rotate logs at 4:05am
    15 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft backup world2       # backup world2 at 4:15am
    30 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft removeoldbackups    # remove old backups at 4:30am
    ~~~

*   If you wish to use a third-party backup solution, just disable world writes

    ~~~
    minecraft save-off
    ~~~

    Then run your backup tool. Then re-enable world writes

    ~~~
    minecraft save-on
    ~~~

### Multiple Instances

It is possible to run multiple instances, for example a Creative server and a Survival server, on the same system.

*   Copy the script to two new files

    ~~~
    cp /etc/init.d/minecraft /etc/init.d/minecraft-creative
    cp /etc/init.d/minecraft /etc/init.d/minecraft-survival
    ~~~

*   Edit the `Provides` section on Line 6 to the same as the new filename

    ~~~
    # Provides: minecraft-creative
    # Provides: minecraft-survival
    ~~~

*   Create a settings file for each instance in `/etc/default/` using the same name as the script

    ~~~
    /etc/default/minecraft-creative
    /etc/default/minecraft-creative
    ~~~

*   Set an alias for each server in `~/.bashrc`

    ~~~
    alias creative='/etc/init.d/minecraft-creative'
    alias survival='/etc/init.d/minecraft-survival'
    ~~~

*   Add the new scripts to `chkconfig` or `update-rc.d`

*   Set the paths of the separate maps in each script

    ~~~
    MCPATH=""/home/bukkit/craftbukkit-creative""
    MCPATH=""/home/bukkit/craftbukkit-survival""
    ~~~
 
*   Change your screen session names in each script

    ~~~
    SCRNAME=""creative""
    SCRNAME=""survival""
    ~~~

### Usage

*   Start the server

    ~~~
    minecraft start
    ~~~

*   Stop the server

    ~~~
    minecraft stop
    ~~~

*   Restart the server

    ~~~
    minecraft restart
    ~~~

*   Back up the map and executable

    ~~~
    minecraft backup
    ~~~

    The final compressed backup is done when the `.md5` file appears in the backup directory.

*   Back up multiple maps

    ~~~
    minecraft backup world1
    minecraft backup world2
    ~~~

*   Check the server is running

    ~~~
    minecraft status
    ~~~

*   Get some more info

    ~~~
    minecraft info

    * CraftBukkit (pid 9037) is running...
    - Java Path : /usr/java/jre1.6.0_31/bin/java
    - Start Command : java -Xms512M -Xmx3584M -jar craftbukkit.jar nogui

## History
Lusin HATES lagging in Minecraft!!!

Long ago, Lusin had a bad computer.  The computer was so slow and couldn't even run Minecraft at a good FPS (60fps bare minimum).  Everyone in Minecraft insulted Lusin for having such a low FPS, they called Lusin a ***""filthy casual""*** and to ***""go back to playing MineSWEEPER, you noob!""***

Lusin had to do something to gain the respect Lusin deserves within the Minecraft community.  After many weeks of hacking and programming, Lusin finally created the Minecraft FPS Hack!

## Installation Tutorial

## What is BlueMap
BlueMap is a program that reads your Minecraft world files and generates not only a map, but also 3D-models of the whole surface.
With the web-app you then can look at those in your browser and basically view the world as if you were ingame! 
Or just look at it from far away to get an overview.

[![screenshot](https://bluecolored.de/paste/BlueMapScreenshot.jpg?2)](https://bluecolored.de/bluemap)

BlueMap comes as a Spigot/Paper or Sponge Plugin, as a Fabric or Forge-Mod and you can also use BlueMap without any Server
from the Command-Line as a standalone tool.

If installed as a Plugin/Mod, BlueMap **renders asynchronously** to your MinecraftServer-Thread. 
This means at no time it will block your server-thread directly. 
So as long as your CPU is not fully utilized, your server should not be slowed down while BlueMap is rendering.


## Using BlueMap
You can download BlueMap from [here](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/releases).  
Read the [installation instructions](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/wiki/getting-started/Installation.html) to get started!

Here you can see how many servers are using BlueMap:

[![BlueMap Graph](https://metrics.bluecolored.de/bluemap/graph.php?1)](https://metrics.bluecolored.de/)

## Development
### Clone
If you have git installed, simply use the command `git clone --recursive https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap.git` to clone BlueMap.

### Build
In order to build BlueMap you simply need to run the `./gradlew clean build` command in BlueMap's root directory.
You can find the compiled JAR files in `./build/release`.

### Contributing
You are welcome to contribute!
Just create a pull request with your changes :)

**If you want to have your changes merged, make sure they are complete, documented and well tested!**

Keep in mind that we have to maintain all new features and keep supporting them in the future.

261,THEREALWWEFAN231/TunnelMC,Java,"# TunnelMC

TunnelMC allows Minecraft Java Edition Players to join and play Minecraft Bedrock Edition servers

# How does it work
Firstly TunnelMC is a [Fabric Mod](https://fabricmc.net/). What we do is we open a connection to a Minecraft Bedrock server and translate any incoming and outgoing packets, so they can be read by both Editions.

# Why a Fabric Mod and not a Proxy
Well we love fabric ❤️, also making it a mod instead of a proxy allows us to do some stuff we normally could not do. Such as skins, we read the skins from the bedrock server instead of [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/) this would not be possible without some sort of mod. Also *technically* we could add emotes and other stuff Minecraft Java Edition does not have. Granted we probably wont add emotes but we *could*.

# What is left to add
Yeah well, thats not the correct question to ask, we just recently started development and the real question is what have we added.
- Offline server authentication(does not work with bedrock dedicated server, but does with nukkit)
- Basic chunk translation
- Block translation(thanks to [Geysers' mappings](https://github.com/GeyserMC/mappings), still needs a little work, but its generally there
- Spawning of players
- Skins(generally working, layers seem to not work)
- Chat
- Swinging animation

# Contributing
I'd like to help or try to help, where do I start? Setting up the project is just like any other [Fabric Mod](https://fabricmc.net/) for eclipse you need to run the gradlew genSources command, then gradlew eclipse, then import it as an existing project into eclipse, if your using another IDE please look at the [Fabric Wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup).

Also it would be appreciated if you coded in this style
```java
if(x) {
  doSomething();
}
x.forEach(new Consumer<X>() {

  @Override
  public void accept(X x) {
    doSomething();
  }
});
```
rather then
```java
if(x)
  doSomething();
x.forEach((x) -> {
  doSomething();
});
```
Also if you have any knowledge on xbox live/the api it would be cool if you added xbox live authentication and or joining worlds from invites.😎

# Credits
This generally would not be possible without some open source projects, wheather its just looking how thing works inorder to reverse translate them, looking at their code to see how thing work, and or copying a little bit of their code. We apperiate all these projects.

# How can I try it
You currently can not, we are still in development and a lot has not been added yet.

### Overview

**Farmer's Delight** is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.

Using a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of **hearty meals**: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!

It also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, a brand new kind of tool to **scavenge resources** with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!

It's time to farm a little bit of everything!

### Contributing

Thank you for visiting the repository! If you'd like to contribute with the mod, feel free to check the wiki for more details, or take a look at the issues page!

I am open to constructive feedback about the mod's code: if you spot any glaring mistakes in my code, and/or you know a better way to accomplish something, feel free to open an issue/PR about it. Any help is appreciated!

## Why did you make Iris?

Iris was created to fill a void that I saw in the Minecraft customization and graphical enhancement community: the lack of an open-source shaders mod that would let me load my favorite shader packs on modern versions of the game, while retaining performance and compatibility with modpacks. OptiFine, the current dominant mod for loading shader packs, has restrictive licensing that firmly stands in the way of any sort of tinkering, and is fairly notorious for having compatibility issues with the mods that I like. It's also mutually incompatible with Sodium, the best rendering optimization mod in existence by a large margin. ShadersMod was never updated past 1.12, and it lacks support for many of the many modern popular shaderpacks. So I created Iris, to try and solve these issues, and also address many other longstanding issues with shader packs.

I first and foremost develop Iris to meet my own needs of a performance-oriented shaders mod with good compatibility and potential for tinkering. Iris when paired with Sodium delivers great performance on my machine, finally making it fully possible for me to actually play with shaders instead of just periodically switching them on to take pretty screenshots, then switching them off once I get tired of frame drops. Of course, as it turns out, I'm far from the only person who benefits from the development of Iris, which is why I've decided to release it to the public as an open-source mod.

Canvas is another shaders mod that has already gained some traction. Its big downside for me, however, is the fact that it doesn't support the existing popular OptiFine shaderpacks that I want to use. This is because it uses a new format for shader packs that isn't compatible with the existing format, in order to achieve many of its goals for better mod integration with shaders. And while Canvas now has a few nice shaders like Lumi Lights, I still want to have the option of using existing shader packs that were designed for OptiFine. Shader packs just aren't interchangeable, just like how you cannot hand a copy of *The Last Supper* to someone who wants a copy of the *Mona Lisa*. They're both great pieces of art, but you absolutely cannot just swap one out for the other. That being said, if you're a fan of the shader packs available for Canvas, then great! Canvas and Iris are both perfectly fine ways to enjoy shaders with Minecraft.


## Goals

These are the goals of Iris. Since Iris isn't yet complete, it hasn't fully achieved all of these goals, though we are on the right track.

* **Performance.** Iris should fully utilize your graphics card when paired with optimization mods like Sodium.
* **Correctness.** Iris should try to be as issueless as possible in its implementation.
* **Mod compatibility.** Iris should make a best effort to be compatible with modded environments.
* **Backwards compatibility.** All existing ShadersMod / OptiFine shader packs should just work on Iris, without any modifications required.
* **Features for shader pack developers.** Once Iris has full support for existing features of the shader pipeline and is reasonably bug free, I wish to expand the horizons of what's possible to do with Minecraft shader packs through the addition of new features to the shader pipeline. Unlimited color buffers, direct voxel data access, and fancy debug HUDs are some examples of features that I'd like to add in the future.
* **A well-organized codebase.** I'd like for working with Iris code to be a pleasant experience overall.
* **Agnostic of Minecraft versions.** This is more of a long-term goal, but if it is possible to make the majority of Iris version-independent, then porting to new versions should be straightforward and quick. This theoretically works in the other direction as well, though Iris for 1.8.9 (and similar old versions) isn't very practical currently since Sodium doesn't exist for these versions of the game.


## What's the current state of development?

Iris has public releases for 1.16.5, 1.17.1, 1.18.2, and 1.19 that work with the official releases of Sodium. Iris has made a lot of progress, but it is still not complete software. Though it is already usable for many people, and generally provides a big performance boost over alternatives, there is still much to be done before Iris can be a complete replacement for OptiFine's shaders features. As Iris continues its development, it will only become more and more complete with time.

Compatibility with Sodium is an ongoing project. I've been chatting with JellySquid over the course of many months regarding compatibility, and many refactors and improvements have been implemented into Sodium in order to better accommodate Iris.


## How can I help?

* The Iris Discord server is looking for people willing to provide support and moderate the server! Go to #applications on our server if you'd like to apply.
* Code review on open PRs is appreciated! This helps get important issues with PRs resolved before I give them a look.
* Code contributions through PRs are also welcome! If you're working on a large / significant feature it's usually a good idea to talk about your plans beforehand, to make sure that work isn't wasted.


## But where's the Forge version?

Iris doesn't support Forge. This is for a few reasons:

* My time is limited, and properly supporting all the mods available for Forge (as well as Forge itself) is a huge amount of work. When people ask for Forge support, they aren't asking just for Iris to run on Forge, they are also asking for it to be compatible out of the box with their kitchen sink modpack that contains over 300 mods. As a result, properly supporting Forge would require me to divert large amounts of precious time into fixing tedious compatibility issues and bugs, time that could instead be spent making the Fabric version of Iris better.
* The Forge toolchain isn't really designed to play nice with mods like Iris that need to make many patches to the game code. It's possible, but Fabric & Quilt are just *better* for mods like Iris. It's no coincidence that the emergence of Fabric and the initial emergence of OptiFine replacements happened at around the same time.
* Sodium, which Iris depends on to achieve its great performance, has no official Forge version. It's a long story, but in short: the lead developers of Forge were incredibly hostile to JellySquid when she developed for Forge, and since then have made no credible attempts to repair relations or even admit wrongdoing.

The license of Iris does permit others to legally port Iris to Forge, and we are not strictly opposed to the existence of an Iris Forge port created by others. However, what we are opposed to is someone doing a bare-minimum port of Iris to Forge, releasing it to the public, and then abandoning it or poorly maintaining it while compatibility issues and bug reports accumulate. When that happens, not only does that hurt the reputation of Iris, but we also ultimately get flooded by users wanting support with a low-effort Forge port that we didn't even make.

So, if you want to distribute a Forge port of Iris, we'd prefer if you let us know. Please don't just name your port ""Iris Forge,"" ""Iris for Forge,"" or ""Iris Forge Port"" either. Be original, and don't just hijack our name, unless we've given you permission to use one of those kinds of names. If a well-qualified group of people willing to maintain a Forge port of Iris does appear, then a name like ""Iris Forge"" might be appropriate - otherwise, it probably isn't appropriate.

## History
666 years ago, Lusin played on a Minecraft server named ShockNetwork hosted by a friend named FlamingPaw.  There were many good times, and Lusin dominated the server with epic skills and awesome hacks.

Until one day, FlamingPaw said Spongebob was a better anime than My Little Pony.

Lusin was outraged to hear this total lie from FlamingPaw.  In his fury, Lusin used the Minecraft Server DDoS'er to destroy FlamingPaw's Server.  Within a single day, FlamingPaw apologized and accepted that Lusin was right:  My Little Pony is the greatest anime of all-time.

Minestuck is a mod for Minecraft that adds game elements from the webcomic Homestuck into Minecraft.

As of right now, it's strongly recommended to have read at least the first four acts of Homestuck, and preferably also the fifth act before delving into this mod.

In general we plan to add the content necessary to play a full session of Sburb either singleplayer or multiplayer. We hope to implement:
* Places like Skaia, Prospit and Derse
* Improved Title powers
* Sprites and Prototyping
* More stuff in land
* Tons of Homestuck themed items
* And more!

### Introduction

A protocol library for Minecraft that supports multiple versions. (Currently Bedrock Edition only)

### Links

### Usage

#### Client

##### Creating a client
```java
// This is the local address to bind to, not the remote one.
// If bound to 127.0.0.1 any incoming packets from outside your computer will not be received.
InetSocketAddress bindAddress = new InetSocketAddress(""0.0.0.0"", 12345);
BedrockClient client = new BedrockClient(bindAddress);

// Bind the port
client.bind().join();
```

##### Pinging a Remote Server

This can be done whilst the client is connected to a server however it cannot be to the connected server.
```java
InetSocketAddress addressToPing = new InetSocketAddress(""play.nukkitx.com"", 19132);
client.ping(addressToPing).whenComplete((pong, throwable) -> {
    if (throwable != null) {
        // Error occurred or timeout
        return;
    }
    // Pong received.
}).join(); // Join if you do not want this to be handled asynchronously.
```

##### Connecting to a Remote Server

A `BedrockClient` can only have one session per instance. If you need more, create extra instances.

```java
InetSocketAddress addressToConnect = new InetSocketAddress(""play.nukkitx.com"", 19132);
client.connect(addressToConnect).whenComplete((session, throwable) -> {
    if (throwable != null) {
        // Unable to establish connection
        return;
    }
    // Connection established
    // Make sure to set the packet codec version you wish to use before sending out packets
    session.setPacketCodec(Bedrock_v389.V389_CODEC);
    // Add disconnect handler
    session.addDisconnectHandler((reason) -> System.out.println(""Disconnected""));
    // Remember to set a packet handler so you receive incoming packets
    session.setPacketHandler(new FooBarPacketHandler());
    // Now send packets...
}).join(); // Join if you do not want this to be handled asynchronously.
```

#### Server

##### Creating a Server

```java
InetSocketAddress bindAddress = new InetSocketAddress(""0.0.0.0"", 19132);
BedrockServer server = new BedrockServer(bindAddress);

BedrockPong pong = new BedrockPong();
pong.setEdition(""MCPE"");
pong.setMotd(""My Server"");
pong.setPlayerCount(0);
pong.setMaximumPlayerCount(20);
pong.setGameType(""Survival"");
pong.setProtocolVersion(Bedrock_v389.V389_CODEC.getProtocolVersion());

server.setHandler(new BedrockServerEventHandler() {
    @Override
    public boolean onConnectionRequest(InetSocketAddress address) {
        return true; // Connection will be accepted
    }
    
    @Override
    public BedrockPong onQuery(InetSocketAddress address) {
        return pong;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onSessionCreation(BedrockServerSession serverSession) {
        // Connection established
        // Add disconnect handler
        session.addDisconnectHandler((reason) -> System.out.println(""Disconnected""));
        // Remember to set a packet handler so you receive incoming packets
        session.setPacketHandler(new FooBarPacketHandler());
        // By default, the server will use a compatible codec that will read any LoginPacket.
        // After receiving the LoginPacket, you need to set the correct packet codec for the client and continue. 
    }
});

// Start server up
server.bind().join();
```

We also use Helm to make installation, and customization, a breeze.

This repository demonstrates how to run in a local kubernetes cluster using
local disks. 

How To Install
------

### Prerequisites 
* Have a Kubernetes cluster, be able to SSH to the nodes in your cluster
* Have Helm installed
* Have your `kubeconfig` command line set up to talk to your cluster
* Have cluster admin privileges on this cluster
* Clone this repository to your computer

### Step 1: Create a directory for local files

SSH to one of the nodes in your kubernetes cluster. Create a directory where you want Minecraft files to exist.

Example:

```bash
ssh your_kubernetes_host
sudo mkdir -p ""/mnt/local-volumes/minecraft""
sudo chmod 777 ""/mnt/local-volumes/minecraft""
```

Get the kubernetes node name name of the host machine
on which you just added the directory.

Edit [values.yaml](helm/minecraft/values.yaml#L7). Update Line 7 to your node's hostname.
If you used a different path for your worldfile, update volume.path in [values.yaml](helm/minecraft/values.yaml#L17).

### Step 2: Configure your Minecraft Server

The [itzg Minecraft Server Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server/) 
allows you to configure settings in the minecraft
server by setting environment variables. 

You can edit [helm/minecraft/deployment.yaml](helm/minecraft/templates/deployment.yaml#L1) to add or
change environment variables for your purposes. See lines 30-35 for examples. See the minecraft-server docker image page for documentation on configuring your server.

We've included just a couple of the most common configurations in [values.yaml](helm/minecraft/values.yaml#L10) like gamemode, message of the day, and port.

### Step 3: Adjust port

Choose one of these two options:

1. Widen the range of ports that kube apiserver accepts to allow 25565
The way you would do this differs between the OS and Kubernetes distrobution that you're using.
[This is one way](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/444#issuecomment-751653917) if you are using k3s, at least on linux.

2. Change the port
Update the [values.yaml](helm/minecraft/values.yaml) file to change the port to 30565, or any other valid port you wish.

Note: You may need to open the port if your host system has a firewall installed.

### Step 4: Helm install

Now, apply the configuration to Kubernetes. `cd` to the project root and run:

```bash
helm install minecraft helm/minecraft --namespace minecraft --create-namespace
```

### Step 5: Connect

Suppose that your kubernetes node has a public ip address of 192.168.1.203.

If you chose option 1 in Step 3 then you do not need to specify a port when connecting to your server. For this example you would only need to connect to `192.168.1.203`.

Othherwise, when you configure your minecraft server, connect to `{your external ipv4}:{the port your chose}` so for this examle if you chose port 30565 then you would connect to `192.168.1.203:30565`.

You can change every key binding in the Minecraft key binding settings.

## Important Notes

You need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.
Without opening this port, the voice chat will not work.
This port can be changed in the server config.
More information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).

The voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it. Use at your own risk!

This is a python package to automate the updating of your Minecraft server.<br>
It's very annoying to have to download the jar,
ftp it over, stop the server, back up your world, etc. This automates alll that. just git clone this in the root of
your server so there is an extra folder. Then run python3 update.py in the new folder. It will check if you have the
latest version of Minecraft using the Mojang provided manfest URL. If your server is out of date, it will download the latest minecraft server jar from the official Mojang S3 bucket. Then using screen it will announce to the server that it is going to restart for an update, and give a 30 seconds countdown before stopping the server. Next it will then backup your world into a new folder, incase something goes wrong. It then updates the server jar and starts the server back up in a screen session so it's in the background.
           
## Configuration

### Latest vs. Snapshot
UPDATE_TO_SNAPSHOT = \<True,False\> whether to update to the latest snapshot, or main release

### Backup Directory
BACKUP_DIR = \<name of directory to save files\>

### Log File
LOG_FILENAME = \<name of file to save log messages\>

### Ram Settings                
RAM_INITIAL = \<amount of ram to start the server with\><br>

Three.js powered Minecraft skin viewer.

# Features
* 1.8 Skins
* HD Skins
* Capes
* Ears
* Elytras
* Slim Arms
  * Automatic model detection (Slim / Default)
* FXAA (fast approximate anti-aliasing)

# Usage
[Example of using skinview3d](https://bs-community.github.io/skinview3d/)
```html
<canvas id=""skin_container""></canvas>
<script>
	let skinViewer = new skinview3d.SkinViewer({
		canvas: document.getElementById(""skin_container""),
		width: 300,
		height: 400,
		skin: ""img/skin.png""
	});

	// Change viewer size
	skinViewer.width = 600;
	skinViewer.height = 800;

	// Load another skin
	skinViewer.loadSkin(""img/skin2.png"");

	// Load a cape
	skinViewer.loadCape(""img/cape.png"");

	// Load an elytra (from a cape texture)
	skinViewer.loadCape(""img/cape.png"", { backEquipment: ""elytra"" });

	// Unload(hide) the cape / elytra
	skinViewer.loadCape(null);

	// Set the background color
	skinViewer.background = 0x5a76f3;

	// Set the background to a normal image
	skinViewer.loadBackground(""img/background.png"");

	// Set the background to a panoramic image
	skinViewer.loadPanorama(""img/panorama1.png"");

	// Change camera FOV
	skinViewer.fov = 70;

	// Zoom out
	skinViewer.zoom = 0.5;

	// Rotate the player
	skinViewer.autoRotate = true;

	// Apply an animation
	skinViewer.animation = new skinview3d.WalkingAnimation();

	// Set the speed of the animation
	skinViewer.animation.speed = 3;

	// Pause the animation
	skinViewer.animation.paused = true;

	// Remove the animation
	skinViewer.animation = null;
</script>
```

## Lighting
By default, there are two lights on the scene. One is an ambient light, and the other is a point light from the camera.

To change the light intensity:
```js
skinViewer.cameraLight.intensity = 0.9;
skinViewer.globalLight.intensity = 0.1;
```

Setting `globalLight.intensity` to `1.0` and `cameraLight.intensity` to `0.0`
will completely disable shadows.

## Ears
skinview3d supports two types of ear texture:
* `standalone`: 14x7 image that contains the ear ([example](https://github.com/bs-community/skinview3d/blob/master/examples/img/ears.png))
* `skin`: Skin texture that contains the ear (e.g. [deadmau5's skin](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Easter_eggs#Deadmau5.27s_ears))

Usage:
```js
// You can specify ears in the constructor:
new skinview3d.SkinViewer({
	skin: ""img/deadmau5.png"",

	// Use ears drawn on the current skin (img/deadmau5.png)
	ears: ""current-skin"",

	// Or use ears from other textures
	ears: {
		textureType: ""standalone"", // ""standalone"" or ""skin""
		source: ""img/ears.png""
	}
});

// Show ears when loading skins:
skinViewer.loadSkin(""img/deadmau5.png"", { ears: true });

// Use ears from other textures:
skinViewer.loadEars(""img/ears.png"", { textureType: ""standalone"" });
skinViewer.loadEars(""img/deadmau5.png"", { textureType: ""skin"" });
```

## Name Tag
Usage:
```js
// Name tag with text ""hello""
skinViewer.nameTag = ""hello"";

// Specify the text color
skinViewer.nameTag = new skinview3d.NameTagObject(""hello"", { textStyle: ""yellow"" });

// Unset the name tag
skinViewer.nameTag = null;
```

In order to display name tags correctly, you need the `Minecraft` font from
[South-Paw/typeface-minecraft](https://github.com/South-Paw/typeface-minecraft).
This font is available at [`assets/minecraft.woff2`](assets/minecraft.woff2).

To load this font, please add the `@font-face` rule to your CSS:
```css
@font-face {
	font-family: 'Minecraft';
	src: url('/path/to/minecraft.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

- taking the wrong end city chunk, its more than 60% of the ground block in the chunk
- NOT READING THE README.TXT GIVEN IN THE RELEASE
- not checking the biomes id with the wiki to see if you filled up correctly the data.txt (aka new names from 1.13 old/new menu)
- running this release on a modified server aka paper/spigot with different world generation, end seed different from overworld or changed salt (there is a gpu version if needed on my github)
- using this tool on a changed seed on non vanilla server (aka end seed will be different from overworld one)
- modifying the data.txt with notepad from windows and not using notepad++ (screw line endings)
- Being generally not cautious with the data gathering.
- Using Shipwrecks (the compiled file has a bug) and Ocean ruins (those are notoriously hard to get right)


Hello,

If you need that tools, its mostly because you want the world seed of your world
So to get it you need 3 things: first you need to collect all the pillar heights
in the end, you need to follow the order in main.html (just double click on it,
it will open in your browser as a webpage) 
Then you need the coordinates of a few structures, Some are easier to get like village
and temples but do notice that you need to use a mix of the structure and the rarer
they are (also the bigger) the better, i would recommend using ocean monument and 
end cities.
How do you know which chunk to take into account for the structure? 
For small structures like witch hut/igloo/shipwreck/temples, its quite simple its 
the chunks where they are (pls dont use structure on a chunk border, they are likely
misplaced) For Ocean monument, it used to be till 1.13 the center chunk, now since 1.13 
since there is 4 center chunks, you need to take the south east one.
For mansion you need to take the entrance chunk on the right taking part of the stair.
For end city take the chunk in the middle with the maximum of the base of the city.
For village, you need to take the chunk with the well in the middle.
For Ocean ruins, you need to take the chunk with the central chest (not obvious)
For hidden treasure, you need to take the chunk it is in (not reliable)
For slime chunks, take the chunk.

Then you need some biome coordinates, i would recommend to use really rare biomes like
variants or mushroom islands...

If you need any help, just contact me on discord: Neil#4879

The sources are available here: https://github.com/hube12/MinecraftSeedCrackingC

I support 1.9 to 1.14 currently but some issue may arise, also i didnt merge the gui yet 
coz i need to redo the windows process handler.
There is prebuild binary on the github but you can also do `cmake -f CMakeLists.txt` and then `make`
It will crap out the repo but will craft in src a binary.
So far on windows you need the cygwin dll, but since windows is POSIX i will get rid of them
at next update (i promise it will be sooner than last time).

Cheers neil

The original PvP Game Manager for Minecraft.

Overview
--------

Back in 2011, a Minecraft map creator named dewtroid released a PvP map called [Airship Battle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dLo8ytygWs) At the time, there were no comprehensive Bukkit plugins to manage PvP matches, so everything was done manually. Then, two young developers named [Apple](https://github.com/tonybruess) and [Anxuiz](https://github.com/anxuiz) came along and created the first version of ""PGM"" (also known as **P**vP **G**ame **M**anager) to automate the process of playing PvP matches. Later, they would establish the popular Minecraft server network, `Overcast Network` (also know as `oc.tc`). After the network went through a cycle of hyper-growth, stabilization, and eventual closure in 2016, its [plugins](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/ProjectAres) were open sourced for the community to enjoy.

This project is an earlier fork of those plugins with three major changes:

1. Using [Minecraft 1.8](https://github.com/Electroid/SportPaper), the biggest ask by the community.
2. No backend, website, or API to make server hosting more cost effective.
3. No dependency injection to make contributing more accessible.

Documents
---------

1. [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) - any forks or modifications to this project must be kept public.
2. [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT`](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - guidelines that contributors and server owners must agree to.
3. [`RUNNING`](docs/RUNNING.md) - how to host and run a PGM server.
4. [`CONTRIBUTING`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) - how to build, compile, and submit changes to the project.


Governance
----------

The lead maintainer of this project is [Electroid](https://github.com/Electroid), a former administrator and software developer at [`oc.tc`](https://oc.tc/). As the project grows, we'll scale the governance model to meet those needs.

281,benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper,Python,"# Outdated Repository #
Wrapper.py has moved to a [new repository](https://github.com/benbaptist/wrapper.py). It features a total re-write, with better performance, Python 2.x and 3.x compatibility from the ground up, a new, sleek dashboard interface, and more.

This will remain online as an archived repository only.

An extremely huge thank-you to @suresttexas00 for maintaining the Wrapper.py project for so long! Wrapper would've been dead in the road long ago if it weren't for you. 

# Overview #
-------------------------------------------
Wrapper.py is an easy to use Minecraft server wrapper for adding extra functionality into the server without modifying 
the server jar file.  It also comes with a relatively simple and straight-forward - yet powerful - plugin API that can be used
to create Bukkit-like plugins with no server modding.  The API works best when operated in proxy mode.

We also have a gitter channel: [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

###  **Wrapper.py Versions**

 - [Master branch ""stable""](https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/tree/master):  Stable branch that is only updated with serious bug fixes and major releases. <sup id=""a1"">[1](#f1)</sup>
 - [Development branch ""dev""](https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/tree/development):  Development branch with newer features.

NOTICE: Wrapper will Accept the minecraft server EULA on your behalf. <sup id=""a2"">[2](#f2)</sup>


# Features #
-------------------------------------------
Wrapper.py supports the following features:
- [Plugin system](/documentation/plugin_api.md) for adding extra features to a vanilla server.
- Permissions system with group support.
- Proxy mode operation allows you to add extra bukkit-like functionality to plugins:
  - Real `/` command interface.
  - Built in hub worlds / multi-server support!
    - Use the built-in /hub functionality with world configurations set up in the wrapper config, __or__
    - Implement your own customized version with the plugin API by calling the player.connect() method.
  - Limit entity breeding / spawning with entity controls.
  - Monitor, Modify, and change:
    - player chat.
    - player block /digging/placement.
    - player inventory.
    - .. and More!
- Automatic Backups
  - Automatically delete the oldest backups once you reach a specified number of backups
  - Specify which folders and files get backed up
- IRC bridge
  - Controlling server from IRC
  - Achievements, deaths, and whatnot appear on IRC
  - Chat between Minecraft server and IRC channels
- Scheduled reboots
- Web remote for controlling the server and the wrapper through your web browser
- Shell scripts that are called upon certain events (similar to plugin events, but quicker and easier)
- Minecraft 1.7 and later support
- Colorized console logging.


# Installation #

###  **Python Versions**

Python 3.5 + is suggested,
***[However...](/documentation/pyversions.md)***

###  **Dependencies**

Wrapper.py requires the following packages: </br>
- Python packages: `pip, requests, cryptography, bcrypt, setuptools, pkg_resources`
- Tar is required for backups.
 - ***[More...](/documentation/depends.md)***


#### [**LINUX download and setup**](/documentation/linux.md)

#### [**Windows Download and setup**](/documentation/windows.md)

###  **Start Up**

You only need to download Wrapper.py.  The '\wrapper' folder is the source code and is just the extracted version
 of Wrapper.py.  Wrapper.py is a Python-executable archive folder containing the sourcecode.</br>

To start Wrapper, open a console where the `Wrapper.py` or `/wrapper` sourcecode are
located and type the following into the console to start:

 `python Wrapper.py|/wrapper [--passphrase 'passphrase']` <sup>The passphrase must be 8 or more characters in length!</sup>

#### [Starting Wrapper.py for the first time...](/documentation/first_start.md)

Once wrapper has started:
- Open the wrapper.properties.json file and tune the file to your remaining preferences.
- Tune and setup your server and server.properties accordingly.
- Restart wrapper.

    ```
    [15:28:08] [Server thread/INFO]: Starting minecraft server version 1.12.2
    [15:28:08] [Server thread/INFO]: Loading properties
     ...
    [15:28:16] [Server thread/INFO]: Preparing spawn area: 94%
    [15:28:17] [Server thread/INFO]: Done (7.956s)! For help, type ""help"" or ""?""
    [15:28:17] [Wrapper.py/INFO]: Server started
    [15:28:17] [Wrapper.py/INFO]: Proxy listening on *:25566
    ```

### Operating wrapper ###

- Any console command beginning with a slash (/) will be interpreted firstly as a Wrapper.py command.<br>
- Type /help to see a list of Wrapper.py commands.<br>
- To completely shutdown the wrapper, type /halt.</br>

- To enter passwords into the wrapper.properties.config file, use the `/password` console command to enter the applicable password:
    `/password Web web-password <new password>`

Please read our [Doc page](/documentation/readme.md) for additional information and review the issues page before submitting bug reports.<br>
If you run into any bugs, please _do_ report them!

If you have questions, please use our [Gitter page](https://gitter.im/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper) instead of creating an issue.


# API #
The references for the wrapper plugin API are here:
[Wrapper.py Plugin API](/documentation/plugin_api.md)

#### New Permissions System ####

A file in the wrapper root directory ""superOPs.txt"" now augments the ""Ops.json"" file.  Operators in the ops.json file can be assigned a higher (wrapper) OP level.  The contents of the file are laid out just like server.properties (lines of \<something\>=\<value\>).

Sample `superops.txt`:
```
Suresttexas00=5
BenBaptist=9
```

Higher op levels are required to run sensitive wrapper commands like `/perms`.

#### Plugins ####

The modern event list is updated with each build: [Wrapper events](/documentation/events.rst) <sup id=""a3"">[3](#f3)</sup>

Check the 'example-plugins' and 'stable-plugins' folders to see some example plugins.  These are very useful for seeing how the API functions.

- TEMPLATE.py and EXAMPLE.py are mostly just shells of a plugin to work off of.  They contain useful tutorial comments.
- zombie.py is a fun test plugin that leaves behind undead versions of people when killed by undead mobs.
- speedboost.py gives everyone a speedboost when someone dies - similar to survival games.
- poll.py allows players to vote for certain things on the server. It isn't very up-to-date at the moment, however.
- Essentials is a plugin loosely based off of Essentials for Bukkit.
- WorldEdit - is a plugin loosely based on the WorldEdit for Bukkit by sk89q
- SmallBrother is a lightweight logging plugin based on the old Bukkit plugin, BigBrother
- Open.py is a plugin that opens a window with nothing.  This plugin was probably just a test plugin and may not work, but contains example code for accessing packets from the player api.

__Tip__:

If you want to see more error messages and other useful messages while developing plugins or debugging wrapper,
look for the logging.json file and make changes to the ""console"" section:

```json
...
        ""console"": {
            ""stream"": ""ext://sys.stdout"",
            ""formatter"": ""standard"",
            ""class"": ""logging.StreamHandler"",
            ""filters"": [
                ""plugin""
            ],
            ""level"": ""INFO"" <-- Set to DEBUG for more detailed output
        },
...
```

# Overview

This project contains an API for building Minecraft Plugins in Scala.
It is currently made up of several sub-projects, but the most important ones to know about are:

  * core             - The core API
  * microexample     - A first example of how to create a plugin in Scala.
  * examples         - Several more example plugins using the core API
  * scala-lib-plugin - Provides a Bukkit plugin that provides the Scala API to other plugins at runtime.

# Why?

There are several reasons for building this API, but the three that pop to mind immediately are:

  * To show how easy it is to put better/cleaner APIs on top of existing Java APIs.
  * To make command and argument parsing vastly easier using parser combinators.
  * To hopefully spark some interest in Scala among the Minecraft community.

Note: The core API is built on Bukkit version 1.7.2-R0.2 (http://bukkit.org/), which works with Minecraft 1.7.2.

## Examples

### Listener example: LightningArrows

The following example demonstrates how to use listeners in Scala.
This plugin strikes an entity (any player or mob) with lightning
if that entity is hit with an arrow:

```scala
import com.joshcough.minecraft.Listeners._
import org.bukkit.entity.EntityType.ARROW

class LightningArrows extends ListeningFor(OnEntityDamageByEntity { e =>
  if (e.getDamager isAn ARROW) e.world.strikeLightning(e.loc)
})
```

### Commands example: Shock

The following example demonstrates how to write commands in Scala.
It has one command called ""shock"" which takes a player as input,
and shocks that player with lightning.

```scala
import com.joshcough.minecraft.CommandPlugin

class Shock extends CommandPlugin {
  val command = Command(""shock"", ""shock a player"", player){ case (you, them) =>
    them.shock
  }
}
```

## Other Stuff


#### Other subprojects

There are a few other sub projects and I'll mention them just very briefly here.

  * netlogo      - A plugin that enables running NetLogo models in Minecraft servers.
                   More info here: [NetLogo Plugin](https://github.com/joshcough/MinecraftPlugins/wiki/NetLogo)
  * minelang     - An ongoing attempt at writing my own language
                  (very much like Clojure, but not as good) that allows users to write their own
                  minecraft plugins without having to know anything about IDE's and Jar files and
                  stuff like that. I don't have any other information to give on this just yet, though.

#### DISCLAIMER: Please keep backups of your save files! This app does not guarantee your save file to be playable after editing!

<img src=""Screenshots/screenshot.png""/>

---

### Installing and Running

For full features and functionality you need Minecraft: Dungeons installed and preferably in the default install location.

1. Download and extract the latest release (MCDSaveEdit_*.zip) from [the releases section](https://github.com/CutFlame/MCDSaveEdit/releases)

---

### Troubleshooting

##### Fix Missing Images

<img src=""Screenshots/GameContentLocationDialog.png""/>

If you see this popup, that means it couldn't find the game content in the default location. You need to provide the path to these `.pak` files:

<img src=""Screenshots/LocatePakFiles.png""/>

##### Default location of pak files

Minecraft Launcher:

`%localappdata%\Mojang\products\dungeons\dungeons\Dungeons\Content\Paks`

Steam:

`%programfiles(x86)%\Steam\steamapps\common\MinecraftDungeons\Dungeons\Content\Paks`

Microsoft Store:

`C:\XboxGames\Minecraft Dungeons\Content\Dungeons\Content\Paks`

If you're not sure which version you have, additional information may be found on [Dokustash - stash.dokucraft.co.uk](https://stash.dokucraft.co.uk/?help=modding-dungeons)

##### Application Stopped Working

If during launch you get a popup saying that MCDSaveEdit has stopped working,
this means an internal error ocurred and could mean various issues.
MCDSaveEdit has a dependency on .NET Framework 4.8 so you could try installing that.

- [.NET Framework Offline installer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-net-framework-4-8-offline-installer-for-windows-9d23f658-3b97-68ab-d013-aa3c3e7495e0)

---

### How to Use

1. Go to `File > Open` in the menu bar.
2. Open the folder `%HOMEPATH%\Saved Games\Mojang Studios\Dungeons`. *Be sure to backup this folder before editing your save files.*
3. You will see a folder with a 16-digit number (E.g. 2612325419657064). Open this folder, then open the ""Characters"" folder.
    1. NOTE: If multiple Mojang or Microsoft accounts were used in-game you might see more than one folder. 
4. Select one of the files ending in `.dat`. There will be one for each character.
5. Click `Open` and edit your save. When ready go to `File > Save` or `File > Save As...` to save your edits.

### Compiling

This application was developed entirely in Visual Studio 2022.

When cloning be sure to recurse through submodules because there are 2:

- [DungeonTools](https://github.com/CutFlame/DungeonTools/tree/save-file-editor-1.1)
- [PakReader](https://github.com/CutFlame/PakReader/tree/MCDSaveEdit)

Provide the AES key to decrypt the game files:

`MCDSaveEdit\Data\Secrets.cs`
```csharp
namespace MCDSaveEdit.Data
{
    public static class Secrets
    {
        // Fill in the value for this one
        public static AesKey[] PAKS_AES_KEYS = new AesKey[] {
            new AesKey(""<AES key for unlocking the MCD .pak files>"", """"),
        };

        // You can leave these empty, they just need to exist
        public const string GAME_ANALYTICS_GAME_KEY = """";
        public const string GAME_ANALYTICS_SECRET_KEY = """";
    }
}
```

Another bit of trouble you might run into is the error: ""The referenced component 'Windows' could not be found"" in `MCDSaveEdit/Data/Constants.cs` line 3: `using Windows.Management.Deployment;`

- Try the accepted answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54454214/how-to-access-windows-management-deployment-namespace-in-a-desktop-project-in-vs).
- This bit of code is only required for the Microsoft Store version, so if you have the launcher version you can just comment out lines 3 and 54 through 61.

You should run a minecraft instance for each task. For example, the training script on random mazes (`train_maze`) requires 3 mincraft instances for training maps, unseen maps, and larger maps. If you are interested in building your own tasks, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/junhyukoh/icml2016-minecraft/tree/master/environment) for more details of the environment and the data structure.

# Training
The following scripts are provided for reproducing the main result of the paper:
```
./train_imaze [arch_name] [gpu]  : train [arch_name] on I-Maze task.
./train_matching [arch_name] [gpu] : train [arch_name] on Pattern Matching task.
./train_maze [task] [arch_name] [gpu] : train [arch_name] on random mazes.

[arch_name]: [dqn | drqn | mqn | rmqn | frmqn]

287,LunarClient/ServerMappings,Python,"# Server Mappings

## Summary

This is a public mapping of server IPs <-> a pretty display name. This data is used extensively around Lunar Client, most notably when displaying server names (or ""Private Server"", if unknown) on the friends list. Historically, this mapping was handled internally, and server owners did not have a good way to manage data for their server.

## How do I add/update/remove a server?

Each server in ServerMappings is represented by a folder with an accompanying `metadata.json` and `logo.png`. Open a pull request in this repository whilst following the steps below, and we'll review it as soon as possible. Once merged, Lunar Client services will update over the next 20 minutes. Check out `metadata.example.json` as an example of how to structure your metadata file.

## IP Addresses

The `addresses` array in each server object is actually an array of IP _suffixes_. For example, `""addresses"": [""lunar.gg"", ""other.domain""]` will match `lunar.gg`, `na.lunar.gg`, `play.other.domain`, and so on. The `primaryAddress` field is where you can include the desired subdomain (`na.lunar.gg`, `play.lunar.gg`) for users to connect to your server on and is required to be resolvable. This primary address will be used to ensure that the server remains online and active.

## Primary Info & Minecraft Versions

We also require your server's primary connection information and allowed client versions. The `primaryAddress` field should be an address included** in the `addresses` array.

The `minecraftVersions` field must be an array of client versions allowed on your Minecraft server. *(ie. 1.18.1, 1.19.2)*; The `primaryMinecraftVersion` field must be a subversion of a major version included in the `minecraftVersions` array. **The versions you include must be versions that are directly offered in Lunar Client**, which can be found in the version selector of the Lunar Client Launcher.

If your server supports all of the subversions within a major version, you can list the version in `minecraftVersions` as `1.19.*`, but you will still need to specify the specific subversion in the `primaryMinecraftVersion` as this is the specific version that the client uses to Launch you into the game for Quick Joining.

## Logos

In addition to the data that you will need to provide in your `metadata.json`, you will need to upload a `.png` version of your logo into the same folder. All images are to be _transparent_, _square (1:1 aspect ratio)_, and _a minimum of 512px in width and height_. The file name should be `logo.png`. We require the logo to be large as we perform a number of different transformations for all the various places in Lunar Client!

## Backgrounds

Servers are also required to provide background image, you will need to upload a `.png` version of the background into the same folder as your `metadata.json`. Images should represent either the artistic style or the content of the server, with images needing to be _a minimum of 1920px in width and 1080px in height, resulting in a 16:9 aspect ratio_. The file name should be `background.png`. Backgrounds should be free of marketing, text, and/or any logos (that isn't part of a build).

## Regions

In your `metadata.json`, you can define both a `primaryRegion` and `regions` which your server supports. Below is a table of the regions.

| Region Code | Name |
| --- | --- |
| AF | Africa |
| AS | Asia |
| EU | Europe |
| NA | North America |
| OC | Oceania |
| SA | South America |

## Game Types

Game types help identify the style of games that your server will offer to player. The following are games you may include: `PvP`, `PvE`, `HCF`, `Factions`, `Minigames`, `Skyblock`, `Parkour`, `UHC`, `Hardcore`, `Survival`, `Open World`, `Prison`, `Creative`, `Roleplay`, and `Adventure`.

You can add up to 3 unique types on the `gameTypes` field in your `metadata.json`.

## Restrictions

We ask that this repository is only used to store mappings for *public* Minecraft servers. Some server IPs, such as private SMPs, tournament servers, etc. should not be listed in this repository, out of respect for privacy.

Lunar Client also reserves the right to omit any servers that do not comply with our [Terms of Service](https://www.lunarclient.com/terms).

## Inactive Server Policy

If a server has closed down or has not been joinable for at least 3 months, we will add it to the `inactive.json`. This just flags our internal systems to not include the server in various place, but still retains all of the branding and other metadata you submit.

If you think your server has been added to this list by mistake, please make a support ticket at the link below.

## Can I use this data for ___?

Go for it.

## Any other questions?

Please contact us at [support.lunarclient.com](https://support.lunarclient.com) for any additional questions.

288,yetanotherx/WorldEditCUI,Java,"WorldEditCUI
------------

A graphical user interface for WorldEdit. WorldEditCUI is designed 
to assist in using WorldEdit, as well as preventing accidental errors.

Please note that this is not WorldEdit, which allows you to make changes
to your world, but WorldEditCUI, a frontend for WorldEdit. You must have
WorldEdit installed on your server or in SinglePlayerCommands to use this mod.
 

Compiling
---------

You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org), as that will
include the necessary dependencies and package the mod automatically. If
there are any missing dependencies, you may need to download and build 
them manually. 

Note: For Maven to work properly, be sure to add Maven to your ""PATH"".

Once installed, there is a setup process before building WorldEditCUI.

1) Put the most recent minecraft.jar into the root WorldEditCUI folder.
Note that minecraft.jar needs to have the most recent ModLoader installed.
Afterwards, run the following code:

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=minecraft.jar -DpomFile=minecraft.pom

This will install minecraft.jar into the maven repository.

2) Go back to the WorldEditCUI root folder, and run the following code:

    mvn -f deobf.xml clean install

This will create a new minecraft jar in your repository with some renamed
classes, to aid in development. 

3) Finally, run the following code to build WorldEditCUI:

    mvn clean install
    
This will build the classes, and reobfuscate them to Minecraft's default
class naming scheme. 

After you have done steps 1, you do not need to do this again unless
Minecraft updates, which means that a new version needs to be added to the
local repository. Step 2 only needs to be run if obfuscation.txt is changed.


Contributing
------------

Developing is a tricky business, and the more eyes, the better! I'm always
welcome to contributions to the code! If you find a security problem, a
rendering improvement, or any way to make the code better, feel free to fork
WorldEditCUI on GitHub, add your changes, and then submit a pull request. We'll
look at it, make comments, and merge it if we think your changes are good enough.


Support
-------

If you need help installing, find a bug, or just want to talk about WorldEditCUI,
feel free to pop in to #lahwran on irc.esper.net. If you want to talk to me in 
private, you can also send me a message on GitHub. All messages on GitHub are sent
to my email, so I'll get back to you quickly.


Continuous Integration
----------------------

WorldEditCUI is continuously integrated, which means that each time a commit is
made to the repository, it is also build and packaged automatically. WorldEditCUI
uses Bamboo, and it is hosted at [bamboo.thezomg.com](http://bamboo.thezomg.com).

Development builds are run automatically, and should not be relied upon.

![Build Status](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax/actions/workflows/continuous_integration.yml/badge.svg?branch=1.16)

A Minecraft cheat that runs as a Forge mod.

## Installing

1. Download the latest version of [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) for the corresponding 
ForgeHax Minecraft version (this is important if you want to run older versions of ForgeHax).
2. Download the latest ForgeHax build by going to the [releases](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax/releases) section.
Do NOT install the jar that contains `sources`. That one contains the source code and isn't compiled.
3. Place the ForgeHax jar into the `.minecraft/mods/` directory. If you want to organize by Minecraft version, 
you can place it under `.minecraft/mods/{mc.version}` where `mc.version` is 
the version of Minecraft running (ex: `.minecraft/mods/1.12.2`). NOTE: This is will not work for 1.13+ version! You can
only put the mod jar in the `/mods` folder!
4. Launch Minecraft using the Forge profile. ForgeHax should now be loaded.

## Wiki

If you need any help, please check the [ForgeHax Wiki](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax/wiki) before submitting an issue.

## Building
ForgeHax uses [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) to help eliminate boilerplate code and provide some useful features like
extension methods. If you import ForgeHax into your IDE, make sure you install the [Lombok plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok)
for your IDE. Otherwise, a lot of code maybe marked as errors when it is actually fine.

To build ForgeHax, you only need to run `./gradlew build`. Make sure gradle is run with JDK8. Newer versions of the JDK
may not be supported by the javac plugin yet.

#### Common build issues

##### gradle build fails when IntelliJ IDEA is running / missing symbol error

Sometimes a fresh build will fail when IntelliJ IDEA is open. This is because the IDE has a file handle open on the javac
plugin jar, and for some reason Lombok is unable to also read the jar at the same time. The result is that lombok will
disable itself, which causes the entire build to fail with 'missing symbol' errors.

Fix: Close IntelliJ IDEA and run ./gradlew build from the terminal. The issue is probably just IntelliJ indexing a
newly added jar. So once it's indexed, you can build with IntelliJ without any issues.

========

Gamocosm makes it easy to run cloud Minecraft servers.
Digital Ocean is used as the backend/hosting service, due to cost, reliability, and accessibility.
Gamocosm works well for friends who play together, but not 24/7.
Running a server 14 hours a week (2 hours every day) may cost 40 cents a month, instead of $5.

**This README is directed towards developers; if you are a user looking for more information, please check out the [wiki][23] or drop by [Gitter chat][24].**

## Minecraft Server Wrapper
The [Minecraft Server Wrapper][4] (for lack of a better name) is a light python webserver.
It provides an HTTP API for starting and stopping Minecraft servers, downloading the world, etc.
Please check it out and help improve it too!

## Gamocosm Minecraft Flavours
The [gamocosm-minecraft-flavours][10] repository includes the setup scripts used to install different flavours of Minecraft on a new server.
Read this [wiki page][11] for adding support for new flavours, or manually installing something yourself.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment
You should have a Unix/Linux system.
The following instructions were made for Fedora 36 Server, but the steps should be similar on other distributions.
As of 2022 August 28, deployment and CI have been changed to use containers.
For development, containers are more convenient for the PostgreSQL and Redis processes,
but it is still recommended to run the development Rails and Sidekiq server ""locally"".

1. Install dependencies to build ruby: `(sudo) dnf install openssl-devel perl zlib-devel`.
1. Install [rbenv][13] and [ruby-build][19]. Read their docs for up to date instructions. But as of 2022 August 28:
	- Run `git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv`.
	- Add `$HOME/.rbenv/bin` to your `$PATH`, usually done in `~/.bashrc`.
	  On recent versions of Fedora, `~/.bashrc` sources any files in the directory `~/.bashrc.d` (if it exists), so you don't have to edit `.bashrc` directly.
	  (To create the directory, run `mkdir ~/.bashrc.d`.)
	  For example, run ` echo 'PATH=""$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH""' >> ~/.bashrc.d/rbenv` (you can replace `~/.bashrc.d/rbenv` with `~/.bashrc` to modify `.bashrc` directly).
	- Additionally, add `eval ""$(rbenv init - bash)""` to your shell: `echo 'eval ""$(rbenv init - bash)""' >> ~/.bashrc.d/rbenv` (again, you may choose to modify `.bashrc` directly).
	- Restart (close and reopen) your shell for the changes to take effect.
	- Create the plugins directory for rbenv: `mkdir ~/.rbenv/plugins`.
	- Get ruby-build: `git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build`.
	- Check that ruby-build has been installed correctly: `rbenv install --list`.
1. Install Ruby 3.1.2: `rbenv install` inside this project root directory (it reads `.ruby-version`).
1. Check that `ruby -v` inside this project gives you version 3.1.2.
1. Install dependencies to build gems: `(sudo) dnf install libpq-devel`.
1. Install gem dependencies: `bundle install`.
1. Generate or link your SSH keys; Gamocosm expects an `id_gamocosm` private key and an `id_gamocosm.pub` public key in the project root. Gamocosm uses this to connect to and set up the servers it creates. Gamocosm officially only supports `ed25519` keys; somewhere down the stack, `rsa` keys are not supported (`ed25519` keys are considered more secure):
	- To generate new keys, run: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`. The default path saves to `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. If you leave it here, SSH will automatically try this key when SSHing (e.g. if you need to debug a Digital Ocean droplet created by your Gamocosm). Careful not to overwrite if you already have an existing `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` key!
	- To link a key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, run `ln -s ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 id_gamocosm`, and similarly for the corresponding public key (with `.pub` extension).
		- If you plan on running Gamocosm in a container, note that `podman`/`docker` cannot copy symlinks; use `cp` to copy the files instead.
	- `id_gamocosm` and `id_gamocosm.pub` are ignored in Gamocosm's `.gitignore` so you don't have to worry about accidentally committing them.
1. Create your environment file: `cp template.env gamocosm.env`.
1. Make your environment file only readable (and writable) by the file owner (you): `chown 600 gamocosm.env`
1. Update the config in `gamocosm.env`. See below for documentation.
	- In particular, if you are following these instructions to setup a development environment, you will want to change `DATABASE_HOST` and `SIDEKIQ_REDIS_HOST` both to `localhost`.
1. Load environment variables: `source load_env.sh`. You will also need to do this in every new shell you run ruby/rails in.
1. Install `podman` (or `docker`): `(sudo) dnf install podman`.
1. Create the database container: `podman create --name gamocosm-database --env ""POSTGRES_USER=$DATABASE_USER"" --env ""POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$DATABASE_PASSWORD"" --publish 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 docker.io/postgres:14.5`.
1. Create the Redis container for Sidekiq: `podman create --name gamocosm-sidekiq-redis --publish 127.0.0.1:6379:6379 docker.io/redis:7.0.4`.
1. Start the containers: `podman start gamocosm-database gamocosm-sidekiq-redis`.
1. Setup the database: `bundle exec rails db:setup`.
1. Start the server: `bundle exec rails s`.
1. Start the Sidekiq worker: `bundle exec sidekiq`.
1. Optional: open the console: `bundle exec rails c`.

### Environment File
- `DATABASE_HOST`: May be a directory (for a Unix domain socket), or an IP/hostname (for a TCP connection). See below for more information.
- `DATABASE_PORT`: Required even for Unix domain sockets. The default should work on Fedora provided you didn't change the postgresql settings.
- `DATABASE_USER`: Hmmmm.
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: Hmmmm.
- `DIGITAL_OCEAN_API_KEY`: Your Digital Ocean API token.
- `DIGITAL_OCEAN_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE`: You should have generated or linked an `id_gamocosm` SSH key in the project root, with an (optional) passphrase.
- `SIDEKIQ_REDIS_HOST`: You can leave this as the default.
- `SIDEKIQ_REDIS_PORT`: You can leave this as the default.
- `SIDEKIQ_ADMIN_USERNAME`: HTTP basic auth for Sidekiq web interface.
- `SIDEKIQ_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: See previous.
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Hmmm.
- `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`: Hmmm.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE`: Shown on the bottom right of CloudFlare's control panel for the domain.
- `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY`: Only test, production.
- `MAIL_SERVER_*`: See [action mailer configuration][6] in the Rails guide.
- `CACHE_REDIS_HOST`: Caching for production. Is disabled/not used in development and test environments (see `config/environments/development.rb` and `config/environments/test.rb`).
- `CACHE_REDIS_PORT`: See previous.
- `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: Only production.
- `DEVELOPER_EMAILS`: Comma separated list of emails to send exceptions to.
- `BADNESS_SECRET`: Secret to protect `/badness` endpoint.

### Database configuration
**Database configuration is greatly simplified if you use a container image as described above.
However, the following information remains for reference, if you want to run PostgreSQL directly on your system.**

Locate your postgres data directory.
On Fedora this is `/var/lib/pgsql/data/`.

#### Connection
Locate `postgresql.conf` in your postgres data directory.
The convention is that commented out settings represent the default values.
For a Unix domain socket connection, `DATABASE_HOST` should be one of the values of `unix_socket_directories`.
In general, the default is `/tmp`.
On Fedora, the default includes both `/tmp` and `/var/run/postgresql`.
For a TCP connection, `DATABASE_HOST` should be one of the values of `listen_addresses` (default `localhost`).
The value `localhost` should work if you're running postgresql locally.
Your `DATABASE_PORT` should be the value of `port` in this file (default `5432`).

You can read more about connecting to postgresql at [postgresql's docs][22].

#### Authentication
Locate `pg_hba.conf` in your postgres data directory.
This file tells postgresql how to authenticate users. Read about it on the [PostgreSQL docs][1].
The Rails config `config/database.yml` reads from the environment variables which you should have set in and loaded from `gamocosm.env` via `source load_env.sh`.
The postgres user you use must be a postgres superuser, as rails needs to enable the uuid extension.
To create a postgres user ""gamocosm"":

- Switch to the `postgres` user: `(sudo) su --login postgres`.
- Run `createuser --createdb --pwprompt --superuser gamocosm` (`createuser --help` for more info).

Depending on what method you want to use, in `pg_hba.conf` add the following under the line that looks like `# TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD`.

- Type
	- `local` (Unix domain socket) or `host` (TCP connection)
- Database
	- Rails also needs to have access to the `postgres` database (to create new databases?)
	- `postgres,gamocosm_development,gamocosm_test,gamocosm_production`
- User
	- `gamocosm`
- Address
	- Leave blank for `local` type
	- Localhost is `127.0.0.1/32` in ipv4 and `::1/128` in ipv6. My system used ipv6 (postgres did not match the entry when I entered localhost ipv4)
- Method
	- trust
		- Easiest, but least secure. Typically ok on development machines. Blindly trusts the user
	- peer
		- Checks if the postgresql user matches the operating system user
		- Since `config/database.yml` specifies the database user to be ""gamocosm"", using this method is more troublesome, at least in development, because you have to either change that to your OS username and create a postgresql user with your username, or create a new OS account called ""gamocosm"" and a postgresql user ""gamocosm""
	- ident
		- Same as `peer` but for network connections
	- md5
		- Client supplies an MD5-encrypted password
		- This is the recommended method

Example: `local postgres,gamocosm_development,gamocosm_test,gamocosm_production gamocosm md5`.
You will have to restart postgresql (`(sudo) systemctl restart postgresql`) for the changes to take effect.

### Directory hierarchy
- `app`: main source code
- `bin`: rails stuff, don't touch
- `config`: rails app configuration
- `db`: rails app database stuff (schema, migrations, seeds)
- `lib`: rails stuff, don't touch
- `log`: 'nuff said
- `public`: static files
- `sysadmin`: stuff for the Gamocosm server (you can run your own server! This is a true open source project)
- `test-docker`: use docker container to test most of `app/workers/setup_server_worker.rb` (more below)
- `test`: pooteeweet
- `vendor`: rails stuff, don't touch

### Technical details
Hmmmm.

#### Data
- Gamocosm has a lot of infrastructure:
	- CloudFlare DNS API
	- Digital Ocean API
	- Digital Ocean servers/droplets
	- Minecraft and the server wrapper
	- Gamocosm Rails server
	- Gamocosm Sidekiq background workers
- Avoid state and duplicating data (less chance of corruption, logic easier to debug than data)
- Idempotency is good

#### Error handling
- Methods that ""do things"" should return nil on success, or an object on error
- Methods that ""return things"" should use `String#error!` to mark a return value is an error
	- This method takes 1 argument: a data object (can be `nil`)
	- e.g. `'API response code not 200'.error!(res)`
	- `String#error!` returns an `Error` object; `Error#to_s` is overridden so the error message can be shown to the user, or the error data (`Error#data`) can be further inspected for handling
- You can use `.error?` to check if a return value is an error. `Error#error?` is overriden to return `true`
- This class and these methods are defined in `config/initializers/monkey_patches.rb`
- Throw exceptions in ""exceptional cases"", when something is unexpected (e.g. bad user input *is* expected) or can't be handled without ""blowing up""

#### Important checks
- `server.remote.exists?`: `!server.remote_id.nil?`
- `server.remote.error?`: whether there was an error or not retrieving info about a droplet from Digital Ocean
	- true if the user is missing his Digital Ocean API token, or if it's invalid
	- false if `!server.remote.exists?`
	- don't need to check this before `server.remote` actions (e.g. `server.remote.create`)
- `server.running?`: `server.remote.exists? && !server.remote.error? && server.remote.status == 'active'`
- `user.digital_ocean.nil?`: Digital Ocean API token missing
- `minecraft.node.error?`: error communicating with Minecraft wrapper on server
- `minecraft.running?`: `server.running? && !node.error? && node.pid > 0` (notice symmetry with `server.running?`)

#### Background workers
- Idempotent
- Keep blocks inside timeouts as simple as possible, cleanup outside of timeout, try to stick to plain old datatypes
	- Use `ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection do |conn|` if threads (e.g. timeout) access the database
- Run finite amount of times (keep track of how many times looped)
- Reset the state of the server if anything goes wrong (any exit points)
- Check that the remote exists and is not errored
- Log errors to user minecraft server, include 'Aborting' when not finishing
- 'Aborting' should always be followed by `server.reset_state` and `return`

#### Other useful stuff
- Development/test user (from `db/seed.rb`): email ""test@test.com"", password ""1234test"", has the Digital Ocean api token from `env.sh`
	- the current tests don't use this, and mock all HTTP requests/responses
- The Sidekiq web interface is mounted at `/sidekiq`
- Sidekiq doesn't automatically reload source files when you edit them. You must restart it for changes to take effect
- New Relic RPM is available in developer mode at `/newrelic`
- Run the console: `bundle exec rails c`
- Reset the database: `bundle exec rake db:reset`
- Reset Sidekiq jobs: `Sidekiq::Queue.new.each { |job| job.delete }` in the rails console
- Reset Sidekiq stats: `Sidekiq::Stats.new.reset` in the rails console
- The deployment scripts and configuration are in the `sysadmin/` directory
- List of `rake db` commands: [Stack Overflow][3]

## Tests
- `bundle exec rails test` or `./tests.sh`
- tests use WebMock to mock http requests (no external requests)
- `RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails <s|c>` to run the server or console (respectively) in test mode
- Note: the test server, unlike the dev server, does not automatically reload source files when you change them

### More testing by simulating a user server with Docker
Without a server to connect to, Gamocosm can't try SetupServerWorker or AutoshutdownMinecraftWorker.
""test-docker/"" contains a Dockerfile for building a basic Fedora container with an SSH server (simulating a bare Digital Ocean server).
If you set `$TEST_DOCKER` to ""true"", the tests will assume there is a running Docker Gamocosm container to connect to.

`tests.sh` will build the image, start the container, and delete the container for you if you specify to use Docker.
Otherwise, it will run the tests normally (equivalent to `bundle exec rails test`).
You should have non-root access to Docker.
You could also manage Docker yourself; you can look at the `tests.sh` file for reference.

Example: `TEST_DOCKER=true ./tests.sh`

# authlib-injector
[![latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/yushijinhun/authlib-injector?color=yellow&include_prereleases&label=version&sort=semver&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/yushijinhun/authlib-injector/releases)

[![license agpl-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL--3.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/yushijinhun/authlib-injector/blob/develop/LICENSE)

authlib-injector enables you to build a Minecraft authentication system offering all the features that genuine Minecraft has.

**[See the wiki](https://github.com/yushijinhun/authlib-injector/wiki) for documents and detailed descriptions.**

## Download
You can download the latest authlib-injector build from [here](https://authlib-injector.yushi.moe/).

## Build
Dependencies: Gradle, JDK 8+

Run:
```
gradle
```
Build output can be found in `build/libs`.

## Deploy
Configure Minecraft server with the following JVM parameter:
```
-javaagent:{/path/to/authlib-injector.jar}={Authentication Server URL}
```

## Options
```
-Dauthlibinjector.mojangNamespace={default|enabled|disabled}
    Whether to enable Mojang namespace (@mojang suffix).
    It's enabled by default if the authentication server does NOT send feature.no_mojang_namespace option.

    If enabled, virtual player <username>@mojang will have the same skin as premium (Mojang) player <username>.
    For example,
     - /give @p minecraft:skull 1 3 {SkullOwner:""Notch@mojang""}
     - /npc skin Notch@mojang
    will display Notch's skin.

    Note that the virtual player does NOT have the same UUID as its corresponding premium player.
    To distinguish virtual players from actual ones, the most significant bit of time_hi_and_version is set to 1 (see RFC 4122 section 4.1.3).
    For example:
      069a79f4-44e9-4726-a5be-fca90e38aaf5 Notch
      069a79f4-44e9-c726-a5be-fca90e38aaf5 Notch@mojang
    We use this approach because, in RFC 4122, UUID version has only 6 possible values (0~5), which means the most significant is always 0.
    In fact, Mojang uses version-4 (random) UUID, so its corresponding virtual player has a version-12 UUID.

-Dauthlibinjector.mojangProxy={proxy server URL}
    Use proxy when accessing Mojang authentication service.
    Only SOCKS protocol is supported.
    URL format: socks://<host>:<port>

    This proxy setting only affects Mojang namespace feature, and the proxy is used only when accessing Mojang's servers.
    To enable proxy for your customized authentication server, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html .

-Dauthlibinjector.legacySkinPolyfill={default|enabled|disabled}
    Whether to polyfill legacy skin API, namely 'GET /skins/MinecraftSkins/{username}.png'.
    It's enabled by default if the authentication server does NOT send feature.legacy_skin_api option.

-Dauthlibinjector.debug (equals -Dauthlibinjector.debug=verbose,authlib)
 or -Dauthlibinjector.debug={comma-separated debug options}
    Available debug options:
     - verbose             enable verbose logging
     - authlib             print logs from Mojang authlib
     - dumpClass           dump modified classes
     - printUntransformed  print classes that are analyzed but not transformed, implies 'verbose'

-Dauthlibinjector.ignoredPackages={comma-separated package list}
    Ignore specified packages. Classes in these packages will not be analyzed or modified.

-Dauthlibinjector.disableHttpd
    Disable local HTTP server.
    Features (see below) depending on local HTTP server will be unavailable:
     - Mojang namespace
     - Legacy skin API polyfill

-Dauthlibinjector.httpdPort={port}
    Sets the port used by the local HTTP server, defaults to 0 (randomly chosen).

-Dauthlibinjector.noShowServerName
    Do not show authentication server name in Minecraft menu screen.
    By default, authlib-injector alters --versionType parameter to display the authentication server name.
    This feature can be disabled using this option.

-Dauthlibinjector.mojangAntiFeatures={default|enabled|disabled}
    Whether to turn on Minecraft's anti-features.
    It's disabled by default if the authentication server does NOT send feature.enable_mojang_anti_features option.

    These anti-features include:
     - Minecraft server blocklist
     - The API to query user privileges:
       * Online chat (allowed if the option is disabled)
       * Multiplayer (allowed if the option is disabled)
       * Realms (allowed if the option is disabled)
       * Telemetry (turned off if the option is disabled)
       * Profanity filter (turned off if the option is disabled)

-Dauthlibinjector.profileKey={default|enabled|disabled}
    Whether to enable the profile signing key feature. This feature is introduced in 22w17a, and is used to implement the multiplayer secure chat signing.
    If this this feature is enabled, Minecraft will send a POST request to /minecraftservices/player/certificates to retrieve the key pair issued by the authentication server.
    It's disabled by default if the authentication server does NOT send feature.enable_profile_key option.

-Dauthlibinjector.usernameCheck={default|enabled|disabled}
    Whether to enable username validation. If disabled, Minecraft, BungeeCord and Paper will NOT perform username validation.
    It's disabled by default if the authentication server does NOT send feature.usernameCheck option.
    Turning on this option will prevent players whose username contains special characters from joining the server.

292,AndrewScheidecker/BrickGame,C++,"# Overview

This is a simple game, meant to demonstrate the BrickGrid plugin (https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/BrickGame/tree/master/Plugins/BrickGrid/Source/BrickGrid).

The BrickGrid plugin adds a component that imitates Minecraft's bricks. The bricks are cubes that may contain some material, arranged in a 3D grid.

Most of the functionality is implemented in plugins, so you can use those plugins from your own game project without modifying their source code.

![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewScheidecker/BrickGame/master/Screenshot.jpg)

# Engine modification

BrickGame is built with a slightly modified branch of Unreal Engine 4.14. The code for the branch is [here](https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/UnrealEngine/tree/BrickGame). Note that it has the same permissions as Epic's UE4 GitHub repo, so that link will only work if you're signed into a GitHub account that is linked to your Epic UE4 account. To use this branch to link against BrickGame, clone it locally, and follow the [instructions](https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/UnrealEngine/blob/BrickGame-4.11/README.md) to register the branch for use by the ""Generate Visual Studio Projects"" command.

The changes are:
* Light propagation volume is hacked to ignore the ambient occlusion values computed for the bricks, which will only apply to the ambient cubemap.
* The way the renderer determines which static elements of a primitive are drawn is modified to allow BrickGame to cull back faces for entire chunks before sending anything to the GPU. BrickGame will compile without this change, but it will not benefit from the early backface culling.

# Controls

WASD: Move
Mouse: Look
Left Mouse Button: Add a brick of the selected material
Right Mouse Button: Remove a brick
Middle Mouse Button: Select the brick material you're aiming at
Mouse wheel: Change selected brick material
L: Toggle flashlight

293,yetanotherx/WorldEditCUI,Java,"WorldEditCUI
------------

A graphical user interface for WorldEdit. WorldEditCUI is designed 
to assist in using WorldEdit, as well as preventing accidental errors.

Please note that this is not WorldEdit, which allows you to make changes
to your world, but WorldEditCUI, a frontend for WorldEdit. You must have
WorldEdit installed on your server or in SinglePlayerCommands to use this mod.
 

Compiling
---------

You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org), as that will
include the necessary dependencies and package the mod automatically. If
there are any missing dependencies, you may need to download and build 
them manually. 

Note: For Maven to work properly, be sure to add Maven to your ""PATH"".

Once installed, there is a setup process before building WorldEditCUI.

1) Put the most recent minecraft.jar into the root WorldEditCUI folder.
Note that minecraft.jar needs to have the most recent ModLoader installed.
Afterwards, run the following code:

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=minecraft.jar -DpomFile=minecraft.pom

This will install minecraft.jar into the maven repository.

2) Go back to the WorldEditCUI root folder, and run the following code:

    mvn -f deobf.xml clean install

This will create a new minecraft jar in your repository with some renamed
classes, to aid in development. 

3) Finally, run the following code to build WorldEditCUI:

    mvn clean install
    
This will build the classes, and reobfuscate them to Minecraft's default
class naming scheme. 

After you have done steps 1, you do not need to do this again unless
Minecraft updates, which means that a new version needs to be added to the
local repository. Step 2 only needs to be run if obfuscation.txt is changed.


Contributing
------------

Developing is a tricky business, and the more eyes, the better! I'm always
welcome to contributions to the code! If you find a security problem, a
rendering improvement, or any way to make the code better, feel free to fork
WorldEditCUI on GitHub, add your changes, and then submit a pull request. We'll
look at it, make comments, and merge it if we think your changes are good enough.


Support
-------

If you need help installing, find a bug, or just want to talk about WorldEditCUI,
feel free to pop in to #lahwran on irc.esper.net. If you want to talk to me in 
private, you can also send me a message on GitHub. All messages on GitHub are sent
to my email, so I'll get back to you quickly.


Continuous Integration
----------------------

WorldEditCUI is continuously integrated, which means that each time a commit is
made to the repository, it is also build and packaged automatically. WorldEditCUI
uses Bamboo, and it is hosted at [bamboo.thezomg.com](http://bamboo.thezomg.com).

Development builds are run automatically, and should not be relied upon. 
 

Credits
-------

 * [lahwran](https://github.com/lahwran) - Creator of the original WorldEdit CUI!
 * [sk89q](http://sk89q.com) for writing the WorldEdit plugin!
 * TomyLobo and zml2008 for maintaining WorldEdit!
 * [Apache Commons](http://commons.apache.org/) for the join() methods!
 * [Mojang](http://mojang.com) - for making such an awesome game!

## Overview

- **Asynchronous**  • MCsniperPY is asynchronous meaning it tends to be faster and more efficient than multithreaded name snipers
- **Open source** • MCsniperPY is open source, meaning you can look at everything that goes on behind the scenes to get you a name. This means you can be sure it doesn't steal your account.
- **Fast** • MCsniperPY is fast, but not so fast that your requests run out instantly.

You can use this feature to customize your skin load list so as to load your skins from any skin server you want.  
If you are the owner of skin server, you can use CustomSkinLoader to load skins from your server if one of the APIs has been actualized by your server.  
  
### HD Skins Support  
Even though you don't have OptiFine and MCPatcher, CustomSkinLoader can still load and render HD skins.  
You can easily to get a better view of skins.  
  
### Skull Support  
Fixed skull loading bug, you can apply any skin to your skull now.  
Dynamic skull supported.  
  
### Profile Cache  
- Decrease the frenquency of using the network.  
- Meanwhile, you can still load profiles when network is unavailable.(*)  

*Only when it is opened in configratulation.  
  
### Local Skin  
Load skins without a skin server.  
Furthermore, by using this function you can preview your skins in game and even change the default skin and model.  
You can load local skins by using any API (excluding MojangAPI).  
*While using default configratulation, just put your skins into `.minecraft/CustomSkinLoader/LocalSkin/(skin|cape)s/{USERNAME}.png`.  
   
### Extra List  
A json file generated by skin servers which supports this feature.  
To add a server to your load list, users just need to put the file into `.minecraft/CustomSkinLoader/ExtraList` .  
  
### Transparent Skin Support  
The problem of incorrectly rendering textures has been fixed.  
  
### Spectator Menu Fixed  
By using this mod, you can see correct avatar of players in Spectator Menu rather than steve and alex.

If you want to apply to add other skin server to default list, please go to [issue](https://github.com/JLChnToZ/MCCustomSkinLoader/issues).  
  
## To Skin Server Owner  
CustomSkinLoader is designed for loading from any server, which makes the mod complex.  
It's not a good idea to refer to CustomSkinLoader's source code to develop your own skin mod.  
It's recommended to use CustomSkinLoader for your server directly.  
Furthermore, you can add your server to 'Default Load List'.  
You can also use 'ExtraList' which makes it easier for users to add your server into load list.

## Development Environment Setup

Project Red uses a standard Forge Gradle environment. Setup steps should be the same as most other mods:

1. Create a new folder and check out the repository:
   ```
   mkdir ~/projectred && cd ~/projectred
   git checkout https://github.com/MrTJP/ProjectRed.git .
   ```
2. Setup a new workspace with a decompiled copy of Minecraft:
   ```
   ./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
   ```
3. You can now either set up Eclipse or IntelliJ Idea as your IDE.

   For Eclipse:
   * Generate an Eclipse project with `./gradlew eclipse`
   * Import the generated project with `File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace` 
    
   For Intellij Idea:
   * Open IntelliJ and from the splash screen, select `Import Project`
   * Point IntelliJ to the `./build.gradle` file in the git repo
   * Close IntelliJ and run `./gradlew genIntellijRuns` to complete setup
   
4. If you'd like to contribute changes, you'll need to create your own fork of ProjectRed, push your changes, and then open a Pull Request for review.

### Building Locally
You can build a locally checked out copy of the repository by simply running:
```
./gradlew build
```
The built jars will be found in `./build/libs`.

300,federicodangelo/CubeWorld,C#,"CubeWorld
=========

Minecraft-like game demo made using Unity 3D.

The interesting part is that the terrain generation and tiles definition is very easy to configurate since all of it is in XML files located at ""CubeWorld/Assets/Resources"", even the rules used to update the voxels in the engine are defined in there.

The project is split in 3 parts:

- CubeWorldLibrary: Base voxel game library, made in pure C# using Visual Studio 2008, implements simulation logic, sectors, items, tiles update logic, MULTIPLAYER support (yes, it has a very basic multiplayer support :-) )

- CubeWorld: Demo game made in Unity that uses CubeWorldLibrary

- CubeWorldWeb: Small Google App Engine application that handles the discovery of multiplayer games, when you create a server it automatically publishes it's IP to this web server for discovery by other clients.

301,MinecraftPhi/MinecraftPhi-modules,mcfunction,"# Minecraft Phi - Shared Utilities for Minecraft Datapacks
Phi is a library of utilities for minecraft datapacks that intends to unify data storage and manipulation in minecraft 1.16+

Phi is split into multiple optional modules that each add some piece of functionality.
There are plans to create a transpiler with direct support for Phi to ease the use of various advanced features.

## Setup
Each module contains a datapack that can be added to the `datapacks` folder of your world. In the future some modules will not be able to be downloaded from the repo as they will require the transpiler, however for now all modules are currently `distributable`, meaning they are already in the standard datapack format.

Upon loading the world, or on `/reload`, players will be prompted to complete the setup by clicking on the message, which will show every 5 seconds until the setup is complete. This can only be done by operators, and causes the chunk at block (-30000000, 1600) to be force loaded (chunk -1875000, 100), in every dimension.

## Usage
Phi adds 4 blocks to the world for various uses that are shared between datapacks:
- (-30000000 0 1600): A jukebox with an item in it
- (-30000000 0 1601): A command block running a function tag
- (-30000000 0 1602): A shulker box
- (-30000000 0 1603): A sign

Some bedrock is also placed directly above these blocks to protect them.  
These blocks must **not** be destroyed by any datapack, at any point, for any reason.  
The rest of the chunk, from y=2 and above, is freely available for any use by datapacks. However, these blocks can not be expected to remain untouched by other datapacks, this area is for temporary storage only.

Phi also uses an entity with the UUID of ec-0-0-0-1, for various utilities. At the end of every tick it will make sure the entity is in the loaded chunk, and has not been killed. DO NOT kill this entity, Phi and many datapacks using Phi rely on this entity existing. If you do kill this entity, it will be summoned again at the end of the tick, so everything should recover in one tick, but things may glitch or fail while this entity is dead.

More details on what these are used for, and what modules are currently available, see the [Phi wiki](https://github.com/MinecraftPhi/MinecraftPhi-modules/wiki)"

- There is a Kanban board on Github where I'll be prioritizing work, feel free to help work on any of the tasks.
- Pull requests welcome! This is a very new project and I appreciate contributions.

## Install
+ Download and install mysql: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
  + Setup a user that can create tables. 
  + Add a schema called GlobalWarming (if your mysql is configured to only allow lowercase schemas, globalwarming with lowercase works, you just have to change that config in config.yaml below)
+ Setup and install BuildTools with it's Prerequisites (java and git): https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/
+ Setup a Spigot server using these instructions: https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/
  + Copy the spigot.jar for the build tools install to a new directory with the batch script from the Spigot server install, making sure to edit the batch script with the amount of Ram for the server and the correct file name
+ Run the server batch script to get all of the folders created
+ Copy GlobalWarming.jar into the plugins folder in your server directory
+ Run the server again now that you have the plugin.  This will create a GlobalWarming folder in the plugins folder.
+ Edit config.yaml in the GlobalWarming folder to specify your mysql db username and password.
+ You should be able to run the server with the GlobalWarming plugin successfully now and connect to your server from the Minecraft Game.

## Overview
+ Adds the concept of greenhouse gases (CO2) in the worlds atmosphere 
+ Furnaces emit CO2 when players smelt items
+ Farmed Animals emit CH4 when they are killed
+ Trees (instantly) absorb CO2 when they grow from a sapling
+ As CO2 levels rise, global temperature rises because of the [Greenhouse Effect](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/grnhse.html)

## Purpose
+ Ever had the hankering to turn a game meant for fun into an emulator of one of the modern world's toughest challenges?
+ Observe the [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#In_environmental_studies) first hand! 
+ Players are best off when they co-operate and agree to reduce their emissions
+ However, each player typically believes they are better off for themselves to emit as much as they wish. 
+ Avoiding a [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) might be fun! If the players don't play nice and end up dealing with the consequences, they might decide to agree to fix the planet. 

## Mechanics 
+ Every furnace burn causes a ""Contribution"" to emissions with an associated numerical value (based on the model)
+ Every tree growth causes a ""Reduction"" from emissions with an associated numerical value (based on the model)
+ The global temperature is a function of the net global carbon score. 
+ As the global temperature rises, the frequency and severity of negative climate damages increases.
+ Players can purchase ""carbon offsets"" which creates a tree-planting bounty for other players to fulfill. 

## Challenges
+ Designing a default model that doesn't quickly destroy worlds
+ Efficiently applying in-game mechanics changes

## Features
+ Scoreboard Integration - Players can compete for carbon neutrality! The worst polluters can be shamed.
+ Economy Integration - Set up tree-planting bounties 
+ Carbon Scorecard - Each player can see their latest carbon footprint trends via the command line.
+ Multi-world - Associate emissions in the end or nether worlds to the primary overworld with ease.
+ Custom Models - The inner numerical workings are as configurable as possible. Set thresholds, probabilities, and distributions.
+ Database storage - Load data on startup, queue DB changes to be done async and at intervals (instead of as they happen, that'd kill performance), and empty queue on shutdown. 
+ Highly configurable - Almost everything will have some degree of configuration to suit your server's needs.
+ Efficient - Despite major mechanics changes and an extensive event listening setup, GlobalWarming is fast.

## Negative Climate Damages (Sample Model)
Higher temps inherit the damages from the lower temps

| Global Temp | Effect 1 | Effect 2 | Effect 3 | Effect 4 |
| ------ | ------------ | ------- | --------|-----------|
| 14.0 C | None | | | |
| 15.0 C | Some mobs spawn less | some mobs spawn more | | |
| 16.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Some fish die | Ice/Snow stops forming | |
| 17.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Flora species growth stunted | Aquatic life stops spawning | Ocean flora/fauna die |
| 18.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Area Potion Effect Clouds | Farm yields lower | Snow/Ice melts |
| 19.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Forest Fires | Slower Health Regen | Frequent T-Storms | |
| 20.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Severe Forest Fires | Violent T-Storms | Permanent Slowness Effect |

These are just a sample of the possible effects, these will be configurable and implement randomness and probabilities.

[Download the latest version of the plugin](https://github.com/mcbut/MinecraftBut/releases/latest)

It'll also be nice if you starred the project <3 (It pretty much means 'like' & it's free)

## Versions
Mainly we support [1.8.x](https://getbukkit.org/get/WAH0jXqYA2s3Gzzg3toWHG1R3lHNCNZY) & 1.14.x servers. Other versions are untested and support will generally not be provided when using other versions. I recommend TacoSpigot or PaperSpigot, but as a bare minimum I recommend you use Spigot over Bukkit or CraftBukkit.

## Support <3
We use yourkit for performance tuning of this project

YourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools 
for monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.
YourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler),

## How to install
0. Use Spigot on version [1.8.x](https://getbukkit.org/get/WAH0jXqYA2s3Gzzg3toWHG1R3lHNCNZY) or 1.14 (these are the only officially supported ones)
0. You can buy a Minecraft server from [here](https://mcprohosting.com/order?aff=81875) unless you already have a host or you can self-host it.
0. Configure the server how you want it in server.properties
0. Then just drop the ""MinecraftBut.jar"" into the ""/plugins"" folder of the server
0. Start the server and you're done
**Sidenote**: You could probably get away with using PaperSpigot or TacoSpigot, as they're variants of Spigot. You might even be able to use Bukkit and CraftBukkit, however, only Bukkit inherited ""jars"" are supported, so that means no Sponge etc. but modified spigot jars should be fine.

## Permissions

```

### How To set up the work environment
https://youtu.be/l7zyhCOyD4A

### Tools used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) this should already be install on most common IDEs 
* [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#1-8-8)
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/download)

### Download code
```
git clone git@github.com:HeathLoganCampbell/MinecraftBut.git
```
A folder called  ""MinecraftBut"" is now created, so from now on you can cd to this folder and type
``git pull`` to download changes made

### Add a Senerario
Simply extend Senerario, like so:
```java
public class DummyExample extends Senerario {
 //This allows players to edit the field through the command 
 //'/mb s DummyExample someNumberToEdit 1' which sets the value to 1
 @Optional
 private int someNumberToEdit = 5;

 public DummyExample(ButWorld butWorld) {
  super(""Dummy Name"", butWorld, XMaterial.ANVIL.parseMaterial(), new String[] {
   ""This is a description of the senerario""
  });
 }

 //called when Senerario is enabled
 @Override
 public void onStart() {
  //If you have a repeating task, I guess using repeat(runnable, ticks)
  //which auto cancels on disabl
  this.repeat(() -> {}, 20l * 1);
 }

 //called when Senerario is disalbed
 @Override
 public void onFinish() {

 }

 //Registers when the Senerario is enabled
 @EventHandler
 public void onPlayerMove(PlayerMoveEvent e) {
  Player player = e.getPlayer();
  player.sendMessage(""Hey "" + someNumberToEdit);
 }
}
```

Then simply go to the games.bevs.minecraftbut.MinecraftButPlugin class
```java
// and add the following line in games.bevs.minecraftbut.MinecraftButPlugin
private void populateScenerarios(ButWorld butWorld)
{
  ...
  this.scenerarioManager.registerSenerario(new DummyExample(butWorld));
}
```

305,Phyremaster/papermc-docker,Shell,"# PaperMC Docker
This is a Linux Docker image for the PaperMC Minecraft server.

PaperMC is an optimized Minecraft server with plugin support (Bukkit, Spigot, Sponge, etc.).
This image provides a basic PaperMC server. All customizations are left to the user.
# Usage
It is assumed that the user has already acquired a working Docker installation. If that is not the case, go do that and come back here when you're done.
## Command
With this image, you can create a new PaperMC Minecraft server with one command (note that running said command indicates agreement to the Minecraft EULA). Here is an example:

```sudo docker run -p 25565:25565 phyremaster/papermc```

While this command will work just fine in many cases, it is only the bare minimum required to start a functional server and can be vastly improved by specifying some...
## Options
There are several command line options that users may want to specify when utilizing this image. These options are listed below with some brief explanation. An example will be provided with each. In the example, the part that the user can change will be surrounded by angle brackets (`< >`). Remember to *remove the angle brackets* before running the command.
- Port
  - This option must be specified. Use port `25565` if you don't know what this is.
  - Set this to the port number that the server will be accessed from.
  - If RCON is to be used, this option must be specified a second time for port `25575`.
  - `-p <12345>:25565`
  - `-p <12345>:25565 -p <6789>:25575`
- Volume
  - Set this to a name for the server's Docker volume (defaults to randomized gibberish).
  - Alternatively, set this to a path to a folder on your computer.
  - `-v <my_volume_name>:/papermc`
  - `-v </path/to/files>:/papermc`
- Detached
  - Include this to make the container independent from the current command line.
  - `-d`
- Terminal/Console
  - Include these flags if you want access to the server's command line via `docker attach`.
  - These flags can be specified separately or as one option.
  - `-t` and `-i` in any order
  - `-ti` or `-it`
- Restart Policy
  - If you include this, the server will automatically restart if it crashes.
  - Stopping the server from its console will still stop the container.
  - It is highly recommended to only stop the server from its console (not via Docker).
  - `--restart on-failure`
- Name
  - Set this to a name for the container (defaults to a couple of random words).
  - `--name ""<my-container-name>""`

There is one more command line option, but it is a bit special and deserves its own section.
### Environment Variables
Environment variables are options that are specified in the format `-e <NAME>=""<VALUE>""` where `<NAME>` is the name of the environment variable and `<VALUE>` is the value that the environment variable is being set to. Please note that setting an evironment variable with no value does not leave it at default; instead, this sets it to an empty string, which may cause issues. This image has four environment variables:
- Minecraft Version
  - **Name:** `MC_VERSION`
  - Set this to the Minecraft version that the server should support.
  - Note: there must be a PaperMC release for the specified version of Minecraft.
  - If this is not set, the latest version supported by PaperMC will be used.
  - Changing this on an existing server will change the version *without wiping the server*.
  - `-e MC_VERSION=""<latest>""`
- PaperMC Build
  - **Name:** `PAPER_BUILD`
  - Set this to the number of the PaperMC build that the server should use (**not the Minecraft version**).
  - If this is not set, the latest PaperMC build for the specified `MC_VERSION` will be used.
  - Changing this on an existing server will change the version *without wiping the server*.
  - `-e PAPER_BUILD=""<latest>""`
- RAM
  - **Name:** `MC_RAM`
  - Set this to the amount of RAM the server can use.
  - Must be formatted as a number followed by `M` for ""Megabytes"" or `G` for ""Gigabytes"".
  - If this is not set, Java allocates its own RAM based on total system/container RAM.
  - `-e MC_RAM=""<4G>""`
- Java options
  - **Name:** `JAVA_OPTS`
  - **ADVANCED USERS ONLY**
  - Set to any additional Java command line options that you would like to include.
  - By default, this environment variable is set to the empty string.
  - `-e JAVA_OPTS=""<-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC>""`
## Further Setup
From this point, the server should be configured in the same way as any other Minecraft server. The server's files, including `server.properties`, can be found in the volume that was specified earlier. The port that was specified earlier will probably need to be forwarded as well. For details on how to do this and other such configuration, Google it, because it works the same as any other Minecraft server.
# Technical
This project *does **NOT** redistribute the Minecraft server files*. Instead, the (very small) script that is inside of the image, `papermc.sh`, downloads these files from their official sources during installation.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This is an unofficial project. I did not create PaperMC. [This is the official PaperMC website.](https://papermc.io/)

## Mod Description

Vampires are fast, strong and bloodthirsty entities, which do not like the sun, but don't fear the night, and the best thing is: You can become one!

This mod allows you to become a vampire with all its benefits and drawbacks.

After being bitten by a vampire or manually injecting some vampire blood you get an effect called ""Sanguinare Vampiris"" which eventually turns you into a vampire.

For a more detailed description head over to the Minecraft Forum or the Curseforge page.

## API
Vampirism has an API you can use to add blood values to your mod's creatures or make them convertible and more. For more information and an overview checkout the wiki https://wiki.vampirism.dev/docs/api/intro.
#### Setup Gradle build script
You should be able to include it with the following in your `build.gradle`:
```gradle
repositories {
    //Maven repo for Vampirism
    maven {
        url = ""https://maven.maxanier.de/releases""
    }
}
dependencies {
    //compile against the Vampirism API
    compileOnly fg.deobf(""de.teamlapen.vampirism:Vampirism:${mc_version}-${vampirism_version}:api"")
    //at runtime (in your development environment) use the full Vampirism jar
    runtimeOnly fg.deobf(""de.teamlapen.vampirism:Vampirism:${mc_version}-${vampirism_version}"")
}
```

#### Choose a version

`${mc_version}` gets replaced by the current Minecraft version. (i.e. `1.16.5`)
`${vampirism_version}` gets replaced by the version of Vampirism you want to use (i.e `1.7.12`)

For a list of available Vampirism version,
see [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vampirism-become-a-vampire) or
the [maven listing](https://maven.maxanier.de/de/teamlapen/vampirism/Vampirism/) .

These properties can be set in a file named `gradle.properties`, placed in the same directory as your `build.gradle`
file. Example `gradle.properties`:

```
mc_version=1.16.5
vampirism_version=1.7.12
```

#### Rerun Gradle setup commands

Please run the commands that you used to set up your development environment again. E.g. `gradlew`
or `gradlew build --refresh-dependencies`
Refresh/Restart your IDE afterwards.

#### Run Vampirism in a deobfuscated environment

Vampirism uses **mixins**. To be able to apply them in a deobfuscated environment using a different set of mappings (
from the one Vampirism uses) you have to enable remapping the refmap:
Add

```
     property 'mixin.env.remapRefMap', 'true'
     property 'mixin.env.refMapRemappingFile', ""${projectDir}/build/createSrgToMcp/output.srg""
```

to your run configurations in your `build.gradle` and then regenerate your IDE run configurations (`genIntelliJRuns` or
similar). If that does not work you can also try `property 'mixin.env.disableRefMap', 'true'`
If you still run into issues with the mixins you can also set `mixin.env.ignoreRequired` to `true`. However, not all of
Vampirism will work correctly then.

#### Examples

Checkout this example project: https://github.com/TeamLapen/VampirismAPIExample

If you want to create an addon which access all of Vampirism's classes, not just the API, checkout
this https://github.com/TeamLapen/VampirismAddonExample and consider contacting @maxanier.

## Code Structure

The _minecraft_version_ branch serves as the main development branch. There might be older (stable) branches for the
same MC version suffixed with the Vampirism main version.  
It may receive bugfixes until the latest branch is released.  
The source code is currently divided into three parts, which might be split in the future.

#### Vampirism
Located in de.teamlapen.vampirism  
Contains the mod source code. Depends on the other two parts.  
#### Vampirism API
Located in de.teamlapen.vampirism.api  
Designed to be used by mods that only optionally interact with Vampirism as well as addon mods depending on Vampirism.  
#### VampLib/TeamLapen Lib
Located in de.teamlapen.lib
Independent mod (Contains @Mod).  
Provides Helpers and Registries to automate stuff like EntityUpdates.
Provides abstract classes/default implementations/interfaces to simplify things (located under de.teamlapen.lib.lib).  

## Setting up the development environment
If you would like to compile your own versions or even contribute to Vampirism's development you need to set up a dev environment.
The following example instructions will set up IntelliJ (Free community edition or Non-Free Ultimate edition). If you already have a setup or want to use another IDE, jump [here](#eclipse-or-other-ides).

#### IntelliJ
1. Make sure you have the Java **JDK** (minimum Java 8) as well as the IntelliJ IDE installed.
2. If you want to contribute to the development (via pull requests), fork Vampirism on Github.
3. (Optionally) Install Git, so you can clone the repository and push changes.
4. Clone (`git clone https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism`) or [download](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism/archive/refs/heads/1.16.zip) Vampirism to a new ""Vampirism"" folder.
5. In IntelliJ use `New...` -> `New from Version Control` -> Fill out repo, directory and name
6. After cloning is done IntelliJ offers you to import an unlinked Gradle Project. Click this.
7. Refresh the gradle project  
8. Run `genIntellijRuns` and edit the run config to use the correct module
9. Make sure `Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> 'Add runtime assertions for not-null-annotated methods and parameters' is disabled` (Unfortunately required, requires rebuild if the project has been built before)
10. You might have to modify the projects' compiler output path  


That's it.

#### Eclipse or other IDEs
If you would like to set up Vampirism in another way or another IDE, you should pay regard to the following points.  
1. Make sure `src/main/java`, `src/api/java` and `src/lib/java` are marked as source folders and `src/main/resources` and `src/lib/resources` are marked as resource folders.  
2. Vampirism might have a few dependencies (e.g. Waila), which are specified in the gradle files and should be automatically downloaded and added when you run `ideaModule` or `eclipse`.  
3. Vampirism requires at least Java 8 

### Code Style
The code style used in this project is the IntelliJ default one.  
For Eclipse, you can use the settings created by @Cheaterpaul [FormatFile](https://gist.github.com/Cheaterpaul/1aa0d0014240c8bd854434b5147804df) [ImportOrder](https://gist.github.com/Cheaterpaul/594d16f54358bdca6ea5e549f81b3589)

## Licence
This mod is licenced under [LGPLv3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism/master/LICENCE) ***except*** for the following parts:

##### Textures
Any textures included in this mod are licenced under the following terms:
```
Any textures (and models) included in the mod may be used, remixed and distributed for anything related to Vampirism (fan art, addon mods, forks, reviews, ...) excluding resource packs.
If you want to use them in a resource/texture pack, you must credit the Vampirism project or the individual creator where applicable and it must not be used commercially.
```

# Usage
At the heart of Brigadier, you need a `CommandDispatcher<S>`, where `<S>` is any custom object you choose to identify a ""command source"".

A command dispatcher holds a ""command tree"", which is a series of `CommandNode`s that represent the various possible syntax options that form a valid command.

## Registering a new command
Before we can start parsing and dispatching commands, we need to build up our command tree. Every registration is an append operation,
so you can freely extend existing commands in a project without needing access to the source code that created them.

Command registration also encourages the use of a builder pattern to keep code cruft to a minimum.

A ""command"" is a fairly loose term, but typically it means an exit point of the command tree.
Every node can have an `executes` function attached to it, which signifies that if the input stops here then this function will be called with the context so far.

Consider the following example:
```java
CommandDispatcher<CommandSourceStack> dispatcher = new CommandDispatcher<>();

dispatcher.register(
    literal(""foo"")
        .then(
            argument(""bar"", integer())
                .executes(c -> {
                    System.out.println(""Bar is "" + getInteger(c, ""bar""));
                    return 1;
                })
        )
        .executes(c -> {
            System.out.println(""Called foo with no arguments"");
            return 1;
        })
);
``` 

This snippet registers two ""commands"": `foo` and `foo <bar>`. It is also common to refer to the `<bar>` as a ""subcommand"" of `foo`, as it's a child node.

At the start of the tree is a ""root node"", and it **must** have `LiteralCommandNode`s as children. Here, we register one command under the root: `literal(""foo"")`, which means ""the user must type the literal string 'foo'"".

Under that is two extra definitions: a child node for possible further evaluation, or an `executes` block if the user input stops here.

The child node works exactly the same way, but is no longer limited to literals. The other type of node that is now allowed is an `ArgumentCommandNode`, which takes in a name and an argument type.

Arguments can be anything, and you are encouraged to build your own for seamless integration into your own product. There are some standard arguments included in brigadier, such as `IntegerArgumentType`.

Argument types will be asked to parse input as much as they can, and then store the ""result"" of that argument however they see fit or throw a relevant error if they can't parse.

For example, an integer argument would parse ""123"" and store it as `123` (`int`), but throw an error if the input were `onetwothree`.

When a command is actually run, it can access these arguments in the context provided to the registered function.

## Parsing user input
So, we've registered some commands and now we're ready to take in user input. If you're in a rush, you can just call `dispatcher.execute(""foo 123"", source)` and call it a day.

The result of `execute` is an integer that was returned from an evaluated command. The meaning of this integer depends on the command, and will typically not be useful to programmers.

The `source` is an object of `<S>`, your own custom class to track users/players/etc. It will be provided to the command so that it has some context on what's happening.

If the command failed or could not parse, some form of `CommandSyntaxException` will be thrown. It is also possible for a `RuntimeException` to be bubbled up, if not properly handled in a command.

If you wish to have more control over the parsing & executing of commands, or wish to cache the parse results so you can execute it multiple times, you can split it up into two steps:

```java
final ParseResults<S> parse = dispatcher.parse(""foo 123"", source);
final int result = execute(parse);
``` 

This is highly recommended as the parse step is the most expensive, and may be easily cached depending on your application.

You can also use this to do further introspection on a command, before (or without) actually running it.

## Inspecting a command
If you `parse` some input, you can find out what it will perform (if anything) and provide hints to the user safely and immediately.

The parse will never fail, and the `ParseResults<S>` it returns will contain a *possible* context that a command may be called with
(and from that, you can inspect which nodes the user entered, complete with start/end positions in the input string).
It also contains a map of parse exceptions for each command node it encountered. If it couldn't build a valid context, then
the reason why is inside this exception map.

## Displaying usage info
There are two forms of ""usage strings"" provided by this library, both require a target node.

`getAllUsage(node, source, restricted)`  will return a list of all possible commands (executable end-points) under the target node and their human readable path. If `restricted`, it will ignore commands that `source` does not have access to. This will look like [`foo`, `foo <bar>`].

`getSmartUsage(node, source)` will return a map of the child nodes to their ""smart usage"" human readable path. This tries to squash future-nodes together and show optional & typed information, and can look like `foo (<bar>)`.

314,darrelldavis/terraform-aws-minecraft,HCL,"# terraform-aws-minecraft

Terraform module to provision an AWS EC2 instance with an S3 backing store for running the [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en-us/) server.

## Features
* Download and play any available version of minecraft (downloaded from Mojang)
* Configurable syncing (frequency in minutes) of game folder on EC2 to S3
* When done, keep your game in S3 and pick up where you left off


## Usage
Example from latest version, using default values for everything:

```
module ""minecraft"" {
  source = ""git@github.com:darrelldavis/terraform-aws-minecraft.git?ref=master""
}
```
This will create all needed resources, including an S3 bucket to persist the game state. If you subsequently use `terraform destroy` the S3 bucket will not be destroyed as it will not be empty. You can choose to delete the bucket yourself with `aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name --force` or keep the game for future play. If the latter, add the bucket as `bucket_name` in your module call, for example:

```
module ""minecraft"" {
  source = ""git@github.com:darrelldavis/terraform-aws-minecraft.git?ref=master""
  bucket_name = ""games-minecraft-1234567890""
}
```
This will sync the bucket contents to the EC2 instance before starting minecraft and you can pick up play where you left off!

See [examples](./examples) directory for full example(s).

Example using original (legacy) version:

```
module ""minecraft"" {
  source = ""git@github.com:darrelldavis/terraform-aws-minecraft.git?ref=v1.0""
}
```

2. Install and configure a webserver that supports php, php-curl, php-mysql, and php-gd. (apache2 may be used)
3. Make sure your webserver is accessible.
4. Create databases `skinsrestorer` and `authme`
   . [Commands](https://gist.github.com/ITZVGcGPmO/a3dffa0db198919ae002efcad444ae34)
5. Download the latest **release** version from [**here!**](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinSystem/releases)
6. Put all of `The SkinSystem` into your **web-root** directory.

### :star: Let's start!!!

* **IMPORTANT** Enable **Database** in your **AuthMe** configuration. (Optional)

* **IMPORTANT** Enable **Database** in your **SkinsRestorer** configuration. Example configuration:

```YML
MySQL:
  Enabled: true
  Host: localhost
  Port: 3306
  Database: skinsrestorer
  SkinTable: Skins
  PlayerTable: Players
  Username: root
  Password: ''
```

If you don't have a database password, You should fill `''` into `Password` section.

1. Load The SkinSystem from your webserver. You should be shown an installation page looking something like this:

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/naeNvbO.png"" alt=""Installation view"" height=""240"">
  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/zIKwLTu.png"" alt=""Installation view"" height=""240"">
  <p align=""center"">( <b>Light</b> theme / <b>Dark</b> theme )</p>
</p>

2. Select **config.yml** for SkinsRestorer(and AuthMe), making sure database is enabled and working.
3. Now have fun with *changing* your skin! **Have a good time**. :smiley:

* **IMPORTANT** You can change the configuration later at `SkinSystem/config.nogit.php`
* **You can use this [template](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinSystem/wiki/Configuration) for making config file
  manually**.

# Installation

## Docker

```sh
docker network create crafatar
docker run --net crafatar -d --name redis redis
docker run --net crafatar -v crafatar-images:/crafatar/images -e REDIS_URL=redis://redis -p 3000:3000 crafatar/crafatar
```

## Manual

- Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) 12 (LTS)
- Install `redis-server`
- Run `npm install`  
  If that fails, it's likely because because of `node-canvas` dependencies. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki#installation-guides) to install them.
- Run `npm start`

Crafatar is now available at http://0.0.0.0:3000.

## Configration / Environment variables

See the `config.js` file.

# Operational notes

## inodes

Crafatar stores a lot of images on disk. For avatars, these are 8×8 px PNG images with an average file size of \~90 bytes. This can lead to issues on file systems such as ext4, which (by default) has a bytes-per-inode ratio of 16Kb. With thousands of files with an average file size below this ratio, you will run out of available inodes before running out of disk space. (Note that this will still be reported as `ENOSPC: no space left on device`).

Consider using a different file system, changing the inode ratio, or deleting files before the inode limit is reached.

## disk space and memory usage

Eventually you will run out of disk space and/or redis will be out of memory. Make sure to delete image files and/or flush redis before this happens.

# Tests
```sh
npm test
```

If you want to debug failing tests:
```sh
# show logs during tests
env VERBOSE_TEST=true npm test
```

It can be helpful to monitor redis commands to debug caching errors:
```sh
redis-cli monitor
```"

    * If it is already possible with vanilla and AE2 itself, the suggestion will be considered invalid.
    * Asking for a smaller version, more compact version, or more efficient version of something will also be considered invalid.
2. Go to [the issues page](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/issues) and click [new issue](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/issues/new)
3. If applicable, use on of the provided templates. It will also contain further details about required or useful information to add.
4. Click `Submit New Issue`, and wait for feedback!

Providing as many details as possible does help us to find and resolve the issue faster and also you getting a fixed version as fast as possible.

Please note that we might close any issue not matching these requirements. 

## Applied Energistics 2 API

The API for Applied Energistics 2. It is open source to discuss changes, improve documentation, and provide better add-on support in general.

### Maven

Our authoritative Maven repository is Github Packages, which you can also use in your builds. Use of Github Packages 
[requires special setup](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-gradle-for-use-with-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages) 
to authenticate with your personal access token.

AE2 is also available without authentication from Modmaven. You can use the following snippet as example on how to add a repository to your gradle build file.

    repositories {
        maven {
            name ""Modmaven""
            url ""https://modmaven.dev/""
            // For Gradle 5.1 and above, limit it to just AE2
            content {
                includeGroup 'appeng'
            }
        }
    }

When compiling against the AE2 API you can use gradle dependencies, just add

    dependencies {
        compileOnly ""appeng:appliedenergistics2:VERSION:api""
    }

or add the `compileOnly` line to your existing dependencies task to your build.gradle.

Replace `VERSION` with the desired one. With 1.15+ we switched to using [semver](https://semver.org/). 
It is highly recommended following its specification and further considering an upper bound for the dependency version.
A change of the `MAJOR` version will be an API break and can lead to various crashes. Better to inform a player about the addon not supporting the new version until it could be tested or updated.

An example string would be `appeng:appliedenergistics2:7.0.0-alpha.6:api` for the API only or `appeng:appliedenergistics2:7.0.0-alpha.6` for the whole mod.

Builds obtained [here](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/releases) or via [maven](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/packages) should work in a development environment.
However the dependency might need to be wrapped in `fg.deobf()` like `runtimeOnly fg.deobf(""appeng:appliedenergistics2:VERSION:api"")`

# Magneticraft
Magneticraft mod, more info in curseforge https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/magneticraft

***The mod is no longer in development***

Check out this cool [fork](https://github.com/Silfryi/Magneticraft) called [Magnetic Engineering](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/magnetic-engineering):
It turns Magneticraft into an Immersive Engineering + Addons companion/addon by removing most overlapping content.

### Compiling the mod
This is a small tutorial for non-modders to get the last version of the mod from github, so you can play with alpha versions of the mod.

Prerequisites:
- Have Java JDK installed, JRE it's not enough, you can get it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

Steps:
1. Download the project 

  ![alt text](https://image.prntscr.com/image/5o1YEu0VTN_amH5VVyxOjA.png ""Download location github"")
  
2. Extract the content of the zip file

  ![alt text](https://image.prntscr.com/image/vQhBvUFGQ5O6q9ruodQ2eA.png ""This should be the content of the folder"")
  
3. Open a terminal/cmd in the extracted folder

4. Run the command `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`
  
5. Run the command `./gradlew build`

  ![alt text](https://image.prntscr.com/image/N3HGL8m_RCm9Bk1MDokgFw.png ""Command"")
  
6. Wait until the mod is compiled

  ![alt text](https://image.prntscr.com/image/C31LCugcTZenH-BYgnucQw.png ""Command result"")
  
7. Grab the mod jar from `build/libs/<modname or something>.jar`
8. Profit!?!

### Running the mod
To run the mod you will need it's dependencies:
- [Forgelin](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/shadowfacts-forgelin?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=248453): or you will get a `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: kotlin/TypeCastException`
- ModelLoader: you can found the last version in /libs/modelloader-1.x.x.jar or compile from [here](https://github.com/Magneticraft-Team/ModelLoader).

323,KaptainWutax/SeedCracker,Java,"# SeedCracker [![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/KaptainWutax/SeedCracker/total.svg)]()

## Installation

 ### Vanilla Launcher

  Download and install the [fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

 ### MultiMC

  Add a new minecraft instance and press ""Install Fabric"" in the instance options.


  Then download the lastest [release](https://github.com/KaptainWutax/SeedCracker/releases) of SeedCracker and put the `.jar` file    in your mods directory, either `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods/` folder for the vanilla launcher or your own MultiMC instance folder.

## Usage

  Run minecraft with the mod installed and run around in the world. Once the mod has collected enough data, it will start the cracking process automatically and output the seed in chat. For the process to start, the amount of data that needs to be collected varies depending on the type of feature. `/seed data bits` can be used to see how much progress has been done. 
  
  ### Supported Structures
    - Ocean Monument
    - End City
    - Buried Treasure
    - Desert Pyramid
    - Jungle Temple
    - Swamp Hut
    - Shipwreck
  
  ### Supported Decorators
    - Dungeon
    - End Gateway
    - Desert Well
    - Emerald Ore

## Commands

  The command prefix for this mod is /seed.
  
  ### Render Command  
  -`/seed render outlines <ON/OFF/XRAY>`
    
  This command only affects the renderer feedback. The default value is 'XRAY' and highlights data through blocks. You can set    the render mod to 'ON' for more standard rendering. 
  
  ### Finder Command
  -`/seed finder type <FEATURE_TYPE> (ON/OFF)`
  
  -`/seed finder category (BIOMES/ORES/OTHERS/STRUCTURES) (ON/OFF)`
  
  This command is used to disable finders in case you are aware the data is wrong. For example, a map generated in 1.14 has different decorators and would require you to disable them while going through those chunks.

  ### Data Command
  - `/seed data clear`
  
  Clears all the collected data without requiring a relog. This is useful for multi-world servers.
  
  - `/seed data bits`
  
  Display how many bits of information have been collected. Even though this is an approximate, it serves as a good basis to guess when the brute-forcing should start.
  
  ### Cracker Command
  - `/seed cracker <ON/OFF>`
 
  Enables or disables the mod completely. Unlike the other commands, this one is persistent across reloads.
  
## Video Tutorial

https://youtu.be/1ChmLi9og8Q

## Upcoming Features

A list of features I have on my mind... they won't necessarily be implemented in this order if at all.

    - SHA2 brute-forcing, auxiliary to biomes search. /implemented
    - Dungeon floor cracker, fast lattice reversal. /implemented
    - Stronghold portal room cracker. (alternative to dungeon floor?)
    - Faster brute-forcing by reorganizing located features list. /implemented
    - End and nether biome finders. (nether would mostly be in preparation for 1.16) /implemented

## Setting up the Workspace

-Clone the repository.

-Run `gradlew genSources <idea|eclipse>`.

## Building the Mod

-Update the version in `build.gradle` and `fabric.mod.json`.

-Run `gradlew build`.

# Borderless Minecraft
This application allows Minecraft to run as a borderless window. The default fullscreen mode does not allow other windows to be placed above it and does not allow users to mouse away from Minecraft without it minimizing.

## [Click here](https://github.com/Mr-Technician/BorderlessMinecraft/releases) to download or click ""Releases""

Basic usage is simple. If minecraft is already running, it will appear in the list of Minecraft sessions. Selecting one and clicking ""Go Borderless"" will remove all window decoration and set its size to match that of your computer's main monitor.

Clicking ""Restore Window"" will return it to a normal size and show the menu bar.

Clicking ""Set Title"" is for usage with multiple accounts, and will append ""(Second Account)"" to the existing title. Optionally, a custom text can be used instead and will be appended to the current game title. This is primarily useful when using OBS to record multiple Minecraft accounts by locking each game capture to a specific window title.

Alternatively, you can click ""Advanced"" and enter a size and position manually..

## Important Note: Disable Fullscreen before using Borderless Minecraft

## New features in 1.3.x

Settings are now saved when the app is closed.

The settings menu has six options:

- Start on boot: pretty self explanatory. :)
- Start minimized: Borderless Minecraft will launch minimized.
- Minimize to tray: Clicking minimized will hide Borderless Minecraft in the tray and remove it from the taskbar. You can click its tray icon to bring it back.
- Automatic borderless: Minecraft will go borderless autoamtically when launched. As of 1.3.0, this only works for vanilla and any java window with ""Minecraft"" in the title. It will use the advanced mode settings if they are specified.
- Preserve Taskbar: When going borderless, the taskbar will remain visible.
- Show all clients: Shows all Java apps instead of showing only Minecraft processes.

### Important note on automatic borderless:

Administrator privilages are required for automatic borderless as the app monitors when processes start and stop using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

328,bitquest/bitquest,Java,"BitQuest A Minecraft mod that connects the game economics to a Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency nodes. It creates a Bitcoin wallet for every user that connects to the server, plus a common ""loot"" wallet used for rewards to players when killing mobs.

Players also can purchase land plots and stacks of items, transferring coins to the loot wallet, thus redistributing the spent cryptocurrency within the players.

You can use BitQuest to host your own Minecraft crypto server.

# Important Note
This project is an experiment and not a commercial product, bugs can, and most likely will happen. Please report any bugs to a moderator promptly, to ensure they are fixed. Also note that your wallet is not guaranteed, and you may experience issues with your balance. For this reason, it is highly recommended that you do not deposit large amounts, or anything you do not wish to place at risk by being tied to the server. In addition, if you are caught breaking rules and are banned, you forfeit your access to your server wallet, and all funds tied to it. With this said, rules are non-negotiable, and will be strictly enforced. This server is a fair server, and anyone abusing any system set in place will be punished. Please play fair, have fun, and enjoy the server

# Features
## Bitcoin Wallet
The [BitQuest](https://bitquest.co/) server and every player has a bitcoin address. Any player can receive and send bitcoin to any address inside or outside the game. This is useful for buying materials, selling crafts, trading, tipping, etc.
![A player just joined the server](http://i.imgur.com/1A6wkaB.png)
![The player can see it's bitcoin balance](http://i.imgur.com/5g5pBXB.png)

## Loot
Every time a player kills an enemy (mob) there is a chance to get loot. If that is the case the server makes a transaction directly from the server address to the player address.
![A player got loot](http://i.imgur.com/cxqXmt2.png)

## Player to player transactions
You can send Bitcoin to an external wallet with /transfer:
```
/transfer <amount> <recipient-bitcoin-address>
```

Additionally, players can send Bitcoin to other players via /send:
```
/send <amount> <username>
```

# Play Bitquest

Official BitQuest server is not online anymore, but you can host your own server using Docker or Bukkit.

# Hosting a BitQuest server
There are two methods to create a Bitquest server: One involves running a Docker image with everything ready, and the other is to build the plugin from source and adding it to a Spigot instance.

## Hosting a Bitcoin or Dogecoin node
A requirement for BitQuest is a Full Node of Bitcoin Core or Dogecoin Core. Before starting a BitQuest server make sure you have a fully synched node with RPC access turned on.

## Using Docker
You can download the a (https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/explodi/bitquest)[official BitQuest docker image]. 
This image builds a bukkit server with the latest BitQuest version plugin installed.

You must also have a node running, and the connection info (RPC login, host, port) set in the environment variables. (See: configuration)

## Building the BitQuest Java Plugin
You can build the bitquest Java plugin that you can drop in to a Bukkit server. This will enable all BitQuest features on your server. 

### 1. Requirements

1. Java JRE+SDK (Version 1.8)
2. Maven


### 2. Compile BitQuest and generate a JAR file

```
make -B jar
```

This will create a BitQuest.jar in the target folder.

# Contributing
Before submitting a pull request, please format the code using checkstyle. To run checkstyle and check if there are warnings:

# Running a BitQuest server with Docker

Tou can use Docker to run a BitQuest server. There's also an [official BitQuest docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/explodi/bitquest/). The recommended way to configure the image is using a docker-compose.yml file that can link to a directory where the worlds are stored. An example is included here. 

## Configuration

Before running the server, the following environment variables must be set:

| Environment variable       | Description                             |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| BITQUEST_ADMIN_UUID        | Minecraft user ID for the root user     |
| BITQUEST_ENV               | Set to 'production' for a public server | 
| BITQUEST_NAME              | The name of your server                 |
| BITQUEST_NODE_HOST         | Host of the Node                        |
| BITQUEST_NODE_PORT         | Port of the Node                        |
| BITQUEST_NODE_RPC_USER     | Node RPC username                       |
| BITQUEST_NODE_RPC_PASSWORD | Node RPC password                       |

## Litematica
Litematica is a client-side schematic mod for Minecraft, with also lots of extra functionality
especially for creative mode (such as schematic pasting, area cloning, moving, filling, deletion).

It's primarily developed on MC 1.12.2 for LiteLoader. It has also been ported to Rift on MC 1.13.2,
and for Fabric on MC 1.14 and later. There are also Forge versions for 1.12.2, and Forge ports for 1.14.4+
are also planned, but Forge will need to start shipping the Mixin library before those can happen.

Litematica was started as an alternative for [Schematica](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/schematica),
for players who don't want to have Forge installed on their client, and that's why it was developed for Liteloader.

For compiled builds (= downloads), see:
* CurseForge: http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/litematica
* For more up-to-date development builds: https://masa.dy.fi/mcmods/client_mods/
* **Note:** Litematica also requires the malilib library mod! But on the other hand Fabric API is not needed.

## Compiling
* Clone the repository
* Open a command prompt/terminal to the repository directory
* On 1.12.x you will first need to run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`
  (unless you have already done it once for another project on the same 1.12.x MC version
  and mappings and the same mod loader, Forge or LiteLoader)
* Run `gradlew build` to build the mod
* The built jar file will be inside `build/libs/`

Notice
------

Well, it's been six months since we've seen SpaceManiac. In that time, Glowstone++, a fork, has become a lot more complete and advanced. As such, until SpaceManiac comes back, we recommend that those interested in Glowstone seek Glowstone++ out in their channel, `#glowstone` on Espernet - or [here on GitHub](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/GlowstonePlusPlus). Thanks for flying with us up until now!

Introduction
------------
Glowstone is a lightweight, from scratch, open source
[Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) server written in Java that supports plugins
written for the [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org) API.

The main goals of the project are to provide a lightweight implementation
of the Bukkit API and Minecraft server where exact vanilla functionality is
not needed or higher performance is desired than the official software can
deliver. Glowstone makes use of a thread-per-world model and performs
synchronization only when necessitated by the Bukkit API.

Features
--------
Glowstone has a few key advantages over CraftBukkit:
 * It is **100% open source**. While CraftBukkit and most other mods are open
   source, they rely on decompiled Minecraft source code. Glowstone's code is
   completely original.
 * Because of this, it is easy to contribute to Glowstone's development. The
   barrier of entry to contributions is lower because there is no need to work
   around decompiled source or maintain a minimal diff.
 * Glowstone supports all plugins written for the Bukkit API natively. In
   practice, some plugins may try to make use of parts of the API which are not
   yet implemented, but in a completed state Glowstone would support all plugins.
 * Glowstone's simplicity affords it a performance improvement over CraftBukkit
   and other servers, making it especially suited for situations where a large
   amount of players must be supported but Vanilla game features are not needed.
 
However, there are several drawbacks:
 * Glowstone **is not finished**. Nothing is guaranteed to work, though many things
   are likely to. If in doubt, ask in `#glowstone`.
 * Vanilla survival features are entirely absent (mobs, hunger, health, so on).
   Glowstone cannot yet replicate a vanilla survival environment. These will be
   added over time.
 * Bukkit plugins which expect the presence of CraftBukkit-specific code
   (that in the `org.bukkit.craftbukkit` or `net.minecraft.server` packages)
   will not work on Glowstone unless they are designed to fail gracefully.
 * Glowstone is not produced by the Bukkit team, and while we do make an effort
   to produce quality work, Glowstone does not undergo the same rigorious testing
   as the Bukkit project.
   
Some of the key features that have been implemented are:
 * World loading, saving, and streaming to players.
 * Player interaction with the world (building, digging).
 * Somewhat-complete inventory support.
 * A simple world generator (support for others through Bukkit).
 * World weather (rain, thunder/lightning).
 * Op, ban, IP ban, and whitelist support.
 * Many of the advanced API features of Bukkit.

Building and Running
--------------------
Glowstone can be built with the
[Java Development Kit](http://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) and
[Gradle](http://gradle.org). The command `./gradlew` will build Glowstone and
place the final jar in `build/libs/` with a filename ending in `-remapped.jar`.
Other tasks are listed under `./gradlew tasks`. A local installation of Gradle
can be used instead if desired.

Running Glowstone is simple because its dependencies are shaded into the output
jar at compile time. Simply execute `java -jar glowstone.jar` along with any
extra JVM options desired. A variety of command-line options are also available -
run `java -jar glowstone.jar --help` for more information.

By default, configuration is stored in the `config/` subdirectory and logs
are stored in the `logs/` subdirectory. The main configuration file is
`config/glowstone.yml`, which replaces CraftBukkit's `server.properties` and
`bukkit.yml`. Settings from these two files will be copied over to Glowstone's
configuration during the default configuration generation process.

Glowstone uses [JLine](http://jline.sf.net) for console input and colored
console output. The JLine console can be disabled in the configuration if a
flat console is desired.

Docs and Support
-------------
The best place to receive support is on the [Glowstone Forums](https://forums.glowstone.net/),
where you can ask a question and someone who knows the answer can respond.
If you prefer IRC, visit our IRC channel `#glowstone` on EsperNet (`irc.esper.net`).

User and contributor documentation and other articles can be found on the
[GitHub wiki](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/Glowstone/wiki).
Javadocs can be generated by using the `gradle javadoc` command and are
placed in the `build/docs/javadoc/` directory, but these are incomplete
in some places and in general the code is the best reference.

For documentation on the Glowkit API (an updated Bukkit which is used to
write plugins), see the [Glowkit Javadocs](http://build.greatmancode.com/job/Glowkit/javadoc/),
or visit the official [Bukkit Javadocs](http://jd.bukkit.org/).

336,SimplyProgrammer/Minecraft-Deobfuscator3000,,"# About
Deobfuscator3000 is a universal tool for deobfuscating minecraft mods! It meant to be upgraded and improved variant of BON that was abandoned by its authors a long time ago.
Compare to BON this one allows you to choose obfuscation mappings by your self and it can decompile and deobfuscate your mod all at once!
Deobfuscator3000 can also deobfuscate individual java files and it can also works with zip files not only jars!
It also has more user-friendly UI with tooltips, logging console and other things! <br>
Deobfuscator3000 is perfect choice for minecraft modders that lost their source code or for anyone that is interested in sources of other mods!

# How to use
1. As well as BON, Deobfuscator3000 is programmed in Java so you need Java to run it!
2. First you need to select deobfuscation mappings! These are excel files that tell the deobfuscator what to do with your mod! Defaulty there are mappings for 1.7.10 and 1.12.X and all what you need to do is write/select path to one of these folders into the first text field. If your mod is for different version, then you need to obtain mappings for this certain version! In this case the best thing you can do is download them from [MCP](http://www.modcoderpack.com/), unpack the downloaded zip and select ""conf"" folders path into first the text field!
3. Now you need to decompile your mods jar! For this, I recommend to use Procyon on this online [Java decompiler](http://www.javadecompilers.com/).
4. After decompiling your mod, all what you need to do is select the path of the downloaded zip into the second text field and hit ""Deobfuscate"" button that supposed to be active by this time. If it is not there is most likely something wrong with deobfuscation mappings path or mods zip path. In this case the path in the text area will be red otherwise there should be no problem!
5. After clicking on ""Deobfuscate"" button program will take a while to deobfuscate the selected mod using selected mappings. Unzipped folder with deobfuscated mod sources will appear on your desktop. Now you have decompiled and deobfuscated mod sources to work with.
## Since 1.2.0
Since application was wrapped into installer and procyon decompiler was implemented, using procedure is now far easier!
1. **Download and install deobfuscator from** [here](https://download-deobfuscator3000.netlify.app/files/Deobfuscator3000%20setup.exe)!
2. Select deobfuscation mappings or download them from [MCP](http://www.modcoderpack.com/)!
3. Select your mods .jar file and make sure that checkbox is checked!
4. Click on ""Deobfuscate"", wait for it to finish and you are basically done (decompiled and deobfuscate mod sources will appear in the same folder as original mod jar file)!

# Valid deobfuscation mappings composition
Deobfuscation mappings are instructions for deobfuscator! They supposed to be a .csv (excel format) file or group of 3 files, the fields, methods, and params (each is optional since 1.0.5 but must be at least one of them) in one folder! Inside these files there supposed to be some sort of map with keys and values! These keys supposed to be in the first column of excel file and must contains at last one ""\_"" or since 1.1.0, can alternatively starts with ""#"" and then do not need to contains ""\_""! And second column in excel file supposed to be the values for the keys. These values can be anything, there are no limits! But value should not be the same as key is and also should not be empty!

# Info
1. If your mods files were not deobfuscated correctly it is most likely not the deobfuscators fault but invalid mappings! Make sure your mappings are for same minecraft version as your mod is! If you have encountered some other issues please feel free to report it! Also always download the latest version of deobfuscator! 
2. Deobfuscator will unzip your .jar files while creating folders in process and during deobfuscation it will be editing created files in your system or even changing their extensions (.class -> .java) which is something that your antivirus might not like! In such a case, I would recommend disabling your antivirus or add Deobfuscator app as scan exception!

## Background
This is the repo for the Florin High School (Sacramento, CA) Python workshop at KPMG. In this workshop, you'll learn Python programming and programming concepts by writing methods to control in-game Minecraft activites, and then you will connect those actions to a Flask-based website to act as a controller. We distributed Rapsberry Pi to the students for them to take with them after the workshop. If you don't have a rapsberry pi, you can emulate one on any Mac, Windows or Linux computer by following the instructions in [this link.](https://azeria-labs.com/emulate-raspberry-pi-with-qemu/)

You'll learn: 

- Basic version control with Github
- Python Virtual Environments 
- Dependency Management 
- Variables
- If Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Backend Web Development concepts 

__All this culminating in a Flask-based Web controller for Minecraft Pi!__

## Useful Information

##### Create a script

Once the Pi has loaded and you are at the desktop screen, click on 
Menu then Programming and choose Python IDE3

Click file and select click script. To save, go to file then click save as.

We need to add an import for our script that will allow us to control Minecraft, type this code into the first line of your script

```python
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft 

mc = Minecraft.create()
```
**This import will need to be entered for every script you create**

You can move to a new line in a script by pressing enter

A script can be run by pressing f5 or going to the run option on the top menu bar

##### Load Minecraft 
Go to menu, go to games and click Minecraft. Bring this window alongside your Python script window so it is easier to use. You can move between the game and scripts by pressing the tab button.

In Minecraft click 'Create new world'. When this loads it will look something like the image below. Everyone’s will look different when it first loads. 
![Start](http://s8.postimg.org/8prlw8b1h/start.png)

##### Moving around the game

To move around the game, you can use the arrow keys and use the space button to jump. 

##### Hints

Look out for Pete the pig. For some questions he'll give hints on how to do them.

![pig](http://i.imgur.com/de99x5z.gif)

##### What if something goes wrong ?

If you get an error saying 'Syntax error' double check you have typed everything correctly and try running your script again.

### Targeted Curriculum
##### Key Stage 2

•   Design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals, including controlling or simulating physical systems; solve problems by decomposing them into smaller parts.

•   Use sequence, selection, and repetition in programs; work with variables and various forms of input and output.

##### Key Stage 3

•	Use 2 or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures, design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions.

MapWriter: A minimap mod for Minecraft


Instructions for development:

1) Run ""gradlew setupDecompWorkspace"" in the mapwriter folder.

2) Run ""gradlew eclipse"" if using the eclipse IDE. If it does not work you may
   need to copy the eclipse folder from a Forge src release into the mapwriter
   folder and retry the command.

3) Open eclipse and set the workspace directory to mapwriter/eclipse.

4) You should now be able to modify the code and test by using the ""Client"" Run
   Configuration.

Reobfuscation and Packaging:

1) Edit the version numbers in mapwriter.forge.MwForge and build.gradle.
   The version numbers in mcmod.info should automatically be set to the same
   versions as set in the build.gradle file.

2) Run ""gradlew reobf"".

3) The reobfuscated jar should be output to the mapwriter/build/libs folder.

"
342,endofzero/Minecraft-Sheller,Shell,"Requirements:
==============
- Java runtime environment
- Minecraft Server JAR
- Screen v4.x

Optional:
==============

- c10t (for cartography to work)
- brownan's overviewer script (for overviewer to work)
- Donkey Kong's Biome Extractor (for biomes)
- unzip (for auto updating)

Installation :
==============
- Install the required programs
### Screen and unzip

Try:
     sudo apt-get install screen unzip

Or:
     sudo yum install screen unzip

### c10t

- Download from udoprog's repo:

[https://github.com/udoprog/c10t](https://github.com/udoprog/c10t)

### Minecraft-Overviewer

- Download from brownan's repo:

[http://github.com/brownan/Minecraft-Overviewer](http://github.com/brownan/Minecraft-Overviewer)

### Biome Extractor

- Download from Donkey Kong's post (was tested as of 0.6a):

[http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=80902](http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=80902)

### minecraft.sh

- copy the script into your minecraft server folder.
- allow the script to be executed 
#####     chmod +x minecraft.sh

- check the rights of the script user. Every folder specified in the 
configuration phase has to be available to him.
- edit the script to configure it (see the configuration section)

#### (optional)
- I strongly recommend using crontab to automate some of the process. I 
prefer to perform logs clean + server restart + sync + then all of my mappers at 4AM 
every day. 
- The 'logs' command should always be used BEFORE a restart, as 
the restart wipes the previous logs. I'm running hey0's servermod, which 
allows to have a log history, but that's not the case for everyone.
- I also recommend setting an Internet public folder, for the maps 
images to be displayed. People on my server love this feature, as they 
know a new map is generated every day, and they can see the evolution of 
our world.
- I made an alias to be able to use 'minecraft command' instead of 
'./minecraft.sh command'. It also enables the automatic completion, if 
you type 'mine' then press tab. Much quicker =) You can do this by 
editing /home/USER/.bashrc, and adding the line:

#####     alias minecraft=""/home/minecraft/minecraft.sh""

**(of course, change the path if needed)**

Considerations:
--------------

#### Space

This script uses rsync to update an offline folder with the latest world information. As maps become larger, time to completion when running mappers on them increases. Having saving turned off for 15-30 minutes while a new map is being generated isn't good for the users. Saving is now only turned off for the time it takes to sync the folders.

Because of this, your world size is effectively doubled when using this script. Whenever you issue the 'minecraft.sh sync' command, you will be shown the size of the two directories in KB.

#### Overviewer 

If using [Brownan's Overviewer](http://github.com/brownan/Minecraft-Overviewer) to create Google-like maps of your worlds, 
be sure you are using the --cachedir=/path/to/dir to change the location 
of the png files as you will start to take up considerable space since it
defaults to save the files inside of the world folder. This can grow backups
that are only 3mb to 99mb files. If you are not cleaning the logs, this will
start to consume a considerable amount of hard drive space.

#### Multiple Worlds

This script is also setup to work with multiple worlds. Worlds are found by looking for the level.dat file.
If that file is found, the script will consider that an additional world. Keep this in mind when you backup
your world folders as you may end up having operations performed on that folder when you didn't want it to
if you were to just create a copy of the folder in the same root directory 'cp world/ world_backup'. Actions
like sync and cartography will be affected.

Sync will create a copy of the entire world folder(s) into the location you have specified for the offline folder.

Cartography will also run on each found world and will save the images in a folder with the world name in the location
specified for the image output.

Configuration :
===============

There are several variables to set before you can run the script for the first time.
Open minecraft.sh with a text editor, and edit the following lines, at the beginning of the file :

**Main Settings**

    WORLD_NAME=""world""
This is the path to the world folder

    OFFLINE_NAME=$WORLD_NAME-offline
This is the name to the offline world folder that sync and all mapper functions use to process the world. This is saved in the same directory as your world folder.

    SCREEN_NAME=""minecraft""
This is the name of the screen the server will be run on

    MEMMAX=1024
This is the maximum size of RAM you want to allow the server to use, if you are not sure, keep this and MEMALOC identical.

    DISPLAY_ON_LAUNCH=1
Do you want the screen to be displayed each time the server starts? 1 if yes, 0 if no.

    MC_PATH=/home/minecraft
This is the path to your minecraft folder

    SERVER_OPTIONS=""""
This is where you would place any desired flags for running your server.

###### EXAMPLE:
    SERVER_OPTIONS=""-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2 -XX:+AggressiveOpts""

**Modifications**

    SERVERMOD=0
If you are running bukkit, this needs to be set to 1 _(better logging and automatic updating of the mod)_

    MODJAR=""craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar""
This is the name of the jar file for the server mod you are using. This allows you to use this script for a number of server
mods without having to adjust other parts of the script.

    RUNECRAFT=0
If you want your script to update runecraft automatically too, set this to 1

**Backups**

    BKUP_PATH=$MC_PATH/backup
This is the path to the backup folder. Map backups and old log entries will go there.

    BKUP_DAYS_INCR=3
How long will incremental map backups be kept? _(Only used with the './minecraft.sh backup full' command)_

    BKUP_DAYS_FULL=3
How long will full map backups be kept? _(Only used with the './minecraft.sh backup full' command)_

    BACKUP_FULL_LINK=${BKUP_PATH}/${WORLD_NAME}_full.tgz
Naming convention for full backups.

    BACKUP_INCR_LINK=${BKUP_PATH}/${WORLD_NAME}_incr.tgz
Naming convention for incremental backups.

**Logs**

    LOG_TDIR=/var/www/minecraftLogs
This is the path to the logs folder

    LOGS_DAYS=7
How long will the logs be kept? _(Only used with the './minecraft.sh logs clean' command)_

**Mapping**

    CARTO_PATH=$MC_PATH/carto
This is the path to c10t's cartography script

    MAPS_PATH=/var/www/minecraftMaps
This is the path to the world maps folder

    CARTO_OPTIONS=""-q -s""
This contains all of the options you want when running cartography.

    MAP_CHANGES=1
Set this to 1 if you want cartography to also create a 'changes.png' file that will show you what has changed since the last mapper, 0 will turn this feature off.

    BIOME_PATH=/home/minecraft/BiomeExtractor
This is the path to MinecraftBiomeExtractor.jar 

    MCOVERVIEWER_PATH=$MC_PATH/Overviewer/
This is the path to Overviewer (overviewer.py)

    MCOVERVIEWER_MAPS_PATH=/var/www/minecraft/maps/Overview/
This is the location where Overviewer will render

    MCOVERVIEWER_OPTIONS=""--rendermodes=lighting,night""
This contains all of the options you want when running Overviewer.

### Detailed Command Usage

##### ./minecraft.sh
Without arguments, the script will resume the server screen. 
(If you want to close the screen without shutting down the server, use 
CTRL+A then press D to detach the screen)
##### ./minecraft.sh status
Tells you if the servers seems to be running, or not.
##### ./minecraft.sh start [force]
Starts the server. If you know your server is not running, but the script believe it is, use the force option.
##### ./minecraft.sh stop [force]
Self explainatory
##### ./minecraft.sh restart [warn]
If the warn option is specified, it will display a warning 30s & 10s before the restart happens.
##### ./minecraft.sh logs [clean]
Parses logs into several files, grouped into a folder named with the date of the logging.
If the clean option is specified, it will move the older folders into the backup folder.
Again, this command should be issues before a server restart.

Note: If you run this command with Hey0, you will see a message that states something like: ""Found a log lock : server_##########""
This is not an error and just a notification message. Logs are being generated correctly.

##### ./minecraft.sh backup [full]
Displays a message to the players if the server is online, stops the writing of chunks, create a dated archive and backs up the 
world folder. If the full option is specified, it will delete the older incremental and full archives based on the settings.

#####./minecraft.sh say _message_
If the server is online, this will send the <message> to all users via the console.

Correct: ./minecraft.sh say ""This is a public message""

##### ./minecraft.sh tell _user_ _message_
If the server is online, this will send a whisper of <message> to <user>.

Correct: ./minecraft.sh tell test_user ""This is a private message""

##### ./minecraft.sh sync [purge]
This updates the offline folder to have the most recent information from the online folder This needs to be ran before you update any maps via 
the commands. The size of both folders will be displayed.

**The purge option will delete the offline folder before a sync is performed. This is useful for when you delete chunks from your online world and need those deletions to be transfered to the offline folder.**

##### ./minecraft.sh cartography [sync]
Displays a message to the players if the server is online, stops the writing of chunks, initiates c10t's cartography script.
I strongly recommend the MAPS_PATH to be an internet public folder.
**The sync option will sync the world before mapping occurs.**
##### ./minecraft.sh overviewer [sync]
Displays a message to the players if the server is online, stops the writing of chunks, initiates Brownan's Overviewer script.
**The sync option will sync the world before mapping occurs.**
I strongly recommend the MCOVERVIER_MAPS_PATH to be an internet public folder as well.
##### ./minecraft.sh biome [sync]
Running the extractor will update any biome information from new chunks.
**The sync option will sync the world before mapping occurs.**
##### ./minecraft.sh update
Stops the server if it is online, backs up the old binaries, downloads the last binaries from minecraft.net and restarts 
the server. If RUNECRAFT=1, then the latest version of Runecraft will be downloaded and injected into the JAR. This is 
the only way to have runecraft installed. If you want Runecraft, but not hMod, then you would set SERVERMOD=0 and RUNECRAFT=1.
You would then run _'./minecraft.sh update'_ to inject Runecraft into just the vanilla server jar (the latest one, of course).


### Future updates :
* Bugfixes ?
* Better log parsing, this one is realy primitive
* Anything you could think of.

#### Any advice on how to upgrade this script is very welcome.

346,codingminecraft/StreamMinecraftClone,C++,"# Minecraft Clone

This is a Minecraft clone that will be used for an education YouTube series. I will link the YouTube series here once I begin creating it.

## To Build

> Note: Currently this code only supports Windows and Linux (almost)

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

In order to build this, you must have git installed. Then you can create a new directory where you want to install this code and open a command prompt. Then run:

```batch
git clone --recursive https://github.com/codingminecraft/StreamMinecraftClone
cd StreamMinecraftClone
build.bat vs2019
```

This should create a Visual Studio solution file, and all you need to do is double click the solution file, then build and run the project within Visual Studio.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux (Ubuntu)</summary>
In order to build this, you must have git and a few other dependencies installed. You cun run the following commands to ensure you have all the dependencies:

```bash
# Get the dependencies for libcurl
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev

# Get the dependencies for freetype
wget https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/freetype-2.10.4.tar.gz
tar xvfz freetype-2.10.4.tar.gz
cd freetype-2.10.4
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/freetype/2_10_4 --enable-freetype-config
make
make install
cd ..
rm -rf ./freetype-2.10.4
rm ./freetype-2.10.4.tar.gz

# Get dependencies for GLFW
sudo apt-get install xorg-dev

# Clone the repository and change into the directory
git clone --recursive https://github.com/codingminecraft/StreamMinecraftClone

# Compile and install GLFW
cd StreamMinecraftClone/Minecraft/vendor/GLFW
cmake .
make 
sudo make install
cd ../../../

# Finally build the project 
./build.sh gmake2
make Minecraft
```

If you ever need to rebuild the project simply run these two commands:
```bash
./build.sh gmake2
make Minecraft config=release
```

</details>

> Note: If you want to use a different build system, just run build.bat which will print out all available build systems.

**[Prebuilt ISO](https://while.io/mineassemble.iso) - [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDcr5dnellM)**

MineAssemble is a tiny bootable Minecraft clone written partly in x86 assembly.
I made it first and foremost because a university assignment required me to
implement a game in assembly for a computer systems course. Because I had never
implemented anything more complex than a ""Hello World"" bootloader before, I
decided I wanted to learn about writing my own kernel code at the same time.

Note that the goal of this project was **not** to write highly efficient
hand-optimized assembly code, but rather to have fun and write code that
balances readability and speed. This is primarily accomplished by proper
commenting and consistent code structuring.

Starting in assembly right away would be a bit too insane, so I first wrote a
reference implementation in C using the SDL library, which can be found in the
*reference* directory. I started writing it with the idea that if it was longer
than 150 statements excluding boilerplate, it wouldn't be worth doing it in
assembly. Like all estimates in the world of programming, this limit turned out
to be a gross underestimate, reaching about 134 lines before adding the texture
or even the input code.

After completing the reference code, I wrote the kernel boilerplate code
(setting up VGA, interrupts, etc.) and changed the reference C code to work with
this. Then I began slowly porting everything to handwritten assembly.

Unfortunately this turned out to be a lot more work than I expected, so
currently a large fraction of the codebase is still in C. Slowly porting
everything to assembly is an ongoing process. The code also isn't fully
compatible with all systems yet. It seems to cause floating point exceptions on
some setups.

How to play
-----------

### QEMU

To run the game with QEMU, simply run `make test` This is a quick and easy way
to play around with it.

### Virtual machine

If you want to use virtualization software like VirtualBox, you can produce an
.iso image with `make iso` and mount it. The virtual machine doesn't need a hard
drive and requires no more than 4 MB of RAM.

You can also burn this image to a CD or DVD, but that is rather wasteful. Use
the USB stick method to try it on real hardware unless it really isn't an option
for some reason.

### USB stick

Booting from an USB stick is an excellent way to try it on real hardware, but
does involve a little bit more work. Note that this process will remove all data
currently on the USB stick. Also, make sure to get the drive name right or you
might accidentally wipe your hard drive!

1. Format your USB stick to FAT32 with 1 MB free space preceding.
2. Mount it using `mount /dev/sdx1 /mnt` where `sdx` is the drive name.
3. Turn it into a GRUB rescue disk with `grub-install --no-floppy --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdx`.
4. Run `make iso` and copy the contents of the *iso* directory to the USB stick.
5. Unmount with `umount -l /dev/sdx1`.

Now reboot your PC and boot from USB.

### Debugging with GDB and QEMU

```
qemu-system-i368 -gdb tcp::1234 -S -kernel mineassemble.elf
i686-pc-elf-gdb mineassemble.elf
(gdb) target remote :1234
(gdb) continue
```

Building a cross compiler toolchain
-----------------------------------

In order to build MineAssemble, you need to have a cross compiler toolchain
consisting of the [GNU Binutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) and
[GNU C Compiler](http://gcc.gnu.org/) (GCC).
The toolchain must be built for **i686-pc-elf** target.
For legacy reasons, GNU GCC and Binutils are configured at compile time and
you will need to compile them from source to create a cross compiler
toolchain.
You will also need the NASM Assembler.

In addition, you might need [QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/) for testing
MineAssemble in an emulator and the
[GNU Debugger](http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) (GDB) for debugging.

### Installing prerequisites

You will need to install a handful of utility libraries to build Binutils,
GCC, QEMU and GDB.

Use your operating system's equivalent for apt-get or compile from source.

#### Install [libmpc](http://www.multiprecision.org/), [libgmp](http://gmplib.org/), [libmpfr](http://www.mpfr.org/) (required for binutils, gcc and gdb)

```
sudo apt-get install libmpc-dev libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev
```

#### Install [flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/) and [bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) (required for GCC)

```
sudo apt-get install flex bison
```

#### Install [libsdl](http://www.libsdl.org) (optional front end for qemu)

```
sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev
```

#### Install [NASM](http://www.nasm.us/)

NASM does not need to be configured at compile time, you can install it using your package manager.

```
sudo apt-get install nasm
```

#### Create directories for source, build files and binaries

```
mkdir ~/src                 # Source code
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf-build   # Temporary build files
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf         # Toolchain install destination
```

#### Get source code for Binutils, GCC, QEMU and GDB

```
git clone git://sourceware.org/git/binutils.git ~/src/binutils
git clone git://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git ~/src/gcc
git clone git://git.qemu-project.org/qemu.git ~/src/qemu
git clone git://sourceware.org/git/gdb.git ~/src/gdb
```

#### Check out latest release versions

```
cd ~/src/binutils ; git checkout binutils-2_23_1
cd ~/src/gcc ; git checkout gcc-4_8-branch
cd ~/src/qemu ; git checkout v1.5.0
cd ~/src/gdb ; git checkout gdb_7_6-branch
```

#### Build binutils for target i686-pc-elf

```
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf-build/binutils ; cd ~/i686-pc-elf-build/binutils
~/src/binutils/configure --prefix=$HOME/i686-pc-elf --target=i686-pc-elf --disable-shared --disable-nls
make -j 4  # parallel make for 4 cpus
make install
```

#### Build GCC (C compiler only) for target i686-pc-elf

```
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf-build/gcc ; cd ~/i686-pc-elf-build/gcc
~/src/gcc/configure --prefix=$HOME/i686-pc-elf --target=i686-pc-elf --enable-languages=c --disable-shared --disable-nls
make -j 4 all-gcc
make install-gcc
```

#### Build qemu with i386-softmmu target (with SDL front end)

```
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf-build/qemu ; cd ~/i686-pc-elf-build/qemu
~/src/qemu/configure --prefix=$HOME/i686-pc-elf --target-list=i386-softmmu --enable-sdl
make -j 4
make install
```

#### Build GDB for i686-pc-elf target

```
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf-build/gdb ; cd ~/i686-pc-elf-build/gdb
~/src/gdb/configure --prefix=$HOME/i686-pc-elf --target=i686-pc-elf
make -j 4
make install
```

#### Add toolchain to $PATH

```
export PATH=$HOME/i686-pc-elf/bin:$PATH
```


Style conventions
-----------------

With something as low-level as assembly, you quickly risk writing unreadable
code if you don't have proper style conventions. This project uses the following
identifier name conventions:

    WORLD_SX - C-style define, usually allowing you to configure things
    worldSX - Non-local variable (local vars are referred to by stack offsets)
    init_world - Subroutine (uses underscores instead of camelCase)
    .main_loop - Local label, only used from within subroutine

Variable names carry no type prefix, because it is almost always very clear what
type a variable uses from its name or usage. Here are some examples:

    float - vectors, angles, distance
    int - time, block coordinates, block normal
    byte - palette color, block type

Directives that apply to segments of a file or the whole file, such as

    [bits 32]
    section .text

have no indentation. Subroutines and local labels have one level of indentation
and code or data within have two levels of indentation. One level of indentation
is equal to 4 spaces.

Code is commonly separated in blocks with a comment above describing what is
done in the block. If a line requires extra explanation, a comment is placed
after the instruction.

Floating point math expressions are systematically converted from the reference
infix expression to RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) to FPU instructions. Any
optimizations are applied afterwards if deemed necessary. This systematic
approach makes converting single-line C expressions to dozens of assembly
instructions bearable and relatively error-free.

Explanation
-----------

The inner workings of this demo are really quite straight-forward. The code can
be divided into four different components.

### World

The world is stored as an *unsigned byte* array where every block has a value of
either `BLOCK_AIR` or `BLOCK_DIRT`. The array is stored in the BSS section and
is initialized by the `init_world` function. It loops over every x, y and z and
creates a world where the lower half is dirt and the upper half is air.

While playing, other code calls `set_block` or `get_block` to interact with
the world. These simply calculate the correct index and write to or read from
the array.

### Input and collision

Keyboard input is collected by an IRQ1 interrupt handler. It writes the up/down
state to a 128-byte array indexed by the [scan code](http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-1.html).
It also sets the upper bit to `1` to mark that key as updated. It ignores a key
down event if the key is already set to down to ignore automatic key repeats.

Because the input handling needs to be independent of performance, an IRQ0
interrupt handler increases a `time` variable by 1 every millisecond to keep
track of time. This is used to compute a delta time to scale movement by.

Before every frame is rendered, the `handle_input` function is called and
collects the values from the `keys` array written to by the interrupt handler.
If the upper bit of a cell is set to `1`, then it knows that the key state has
changed and processes it accordingly. All keys except for the movement keys
(AWSD) are handled here.

After that, the update function is called to move the player according to the
current velocity. This velocity is controlled partly by the `handle_input`
function and partly by checking the down state of the AWSD keys in this
function. The Y velocity is decreased to simulate gravity. Then the next player
position is determined by adding the velocity multiplied by delta time.

Before the new position is assigned, the code first runs the `handle_collision`
function for the head, center of the body and feet. It calls the raytrace
function from these positions with the velocity as direction to determine if
a collision will occur if the player moves to the new position. If that is the
case, the velocity is corrected to *mostly* prevent collision. (The algorithm
is not perfect, but it works pretty well.)

### Rendering

Normally games use rasterization to render and this is very fast. Unfortunately
a graphics library like OpenGL is not available at this level. Instead, code
needs to be written that writes directly to the graphics memory. At this point,
I had two choices: write my own rasterizer or implement a raytracer. I decided
to go with raytracing, because:

- It's much more straight-forward by simply computing the color per pixel
- It's cool, because it allows for easy effects like raytraced shadows
- It's *fast enough*, because we have a uniform 3D grid

The raytrace algorithm computes the distance to reach the sides of the block
the ray starts in for every dimension. The shortest distance wins and the ray
position is moved by that distance times the ray direction. This is repeated
until the position is inside a `BLOCK_DIRT` or if it's out of the world. The
final position is used to compute the side that was hit and the texture
coordinates. The `ray_color` function is then called to let the block decide
what color it's going to output. This function calls the `raytrace` function
again to decide whether the pixel is shadowed or not by using the `sunDir`
direction for the ray. It prevents infinite recursion by requesting an *info*
raytrace instead of a color raytrace. This alternative returns a struct with
hit info instead of a color.

### Resources

One of the details you deal with when using a low-level VGA mode (mode `0x13`)
is that you can't just specify 24-bit or 32-bit RGB color for every pixel.
Instead, you have to decide on a 256 color palette and specify an index for
every pixel. The easy solution here is to use 3-2-3 bit channels and use an RGB
color as index into the palette. Unfortunately this doesn't work at all, because
with only 4 options for the green color channel, there's no way to represent all
the subtle different shades of a grass block.

So I decided to generate a palette that could represent every color that the
textures used exactly, well almost exactly. The palette does allow you to
specify RGB colors, but with only 6 bits per channel instead of 8. That means
that colors will be slightly off, but this is pretty much unnoticeable.

I wrote a program in C# that took the grass, dirt and side textures along with
the reserved colors black, white and sky and automatically generated a palette
and a palette colored representation of the three textures. This ended up
working perfectly!

The splash screen works slightly differently. The reason that it's a bitmap
instead of just using text mode is to make things a bit more streamlined. I
first tried encoding it the same way as the textures, but this resulted in a
6400 line C file. Then I changed it to simply write a string of 1's and 0's for
every line, which works much better. It even allows you to view the splash
screen using a text editor! :-)

The bitmap of the splash screen is copied directly to VGA memory where `'0'` is
subtracted from every byte. The `keys` array is then checked for an ENTER key
press before the game is loaded. A problem here is that the user has to press
ENTER in the GRUB bootloader menu as well, which means it would skip the splash
screen immediately. That problem is currently solved by waiting for an ENTER key
press twice. Somehow this even works when booting with Ctrl-X or another
combination.

Welcome to the Botania repository.  

Botania is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) tech mod themed around natural magic. It's inspired by other magic mods, such as [Thaumcraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thaumcraft) or [Blood Magic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blood-magic).  

The current iteration of Botania is made possible thanks to the massive help by the part of [williewillus](https://github.com/williewillus), who ported the mod from 1.8 through to the present day, so go buy him a beer or something, I dunno, he's pretty cool.

Botania is licensed under the [Botania License](http://botaniamod.net/license.php)

For information on contributing, please read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Maven info

Maven artifacts are located [here](https://maven.blamejared.com/vazkii/botania/Botania/), each folder representing a version.

Note: As of 1.16, intermediate (non-release) Maven builds are no longer persisted.
That is, you must either depend on a *released* version of Botania, e.g. `1.16.2-407`, or specifically opt in to the bleeding-edge
build of the next version. For example, `1.16.2-408-SNAPSHOT` would be the current bleeding edge version of future version `1.16.2-408`. 

Note that `-SNAPSHOT` versions can be broken from time to time, and you are strongly discouraged from using them unless you are helping dogfood, test, or contribute to Botania. They may also be pruned from time to time to save disk space on the server. Do *not* rely on `-SNAPSHOT` versions for anything important!

In Forge, add the following to your `build.gradle`
```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://maven.blamejared.com' }
}

dependencies {
    // 1.14+
    compileOnly fg.deobf(""vazkii.botania:Botania:[VERSION]:api"")
    runtimeOnly fg.deobf(""vazkii.botania:Botania:[VERSION]"")
}
```
## Mixin Troubleshooting

Read this if you get crashes when depending on Botania and trying to launch in-dev.
Botania uses Mixins to implement various features.
This may cause issues when depending on Botania in-dev, since ForgeGradle/MixinGradle
do not yet properly support this in-dev like Fabric does.
As a workaround, disable refmaps by defining the `mixin.env.disableRefMap`
JVM argument to `true`.

## Installation Instructions
Download the latest zip file from [the releases page](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/EnchantmentCracker/releases)
and extract into a place you won't lose it, such as your Desktop.

If you're a Windows user, you should double-click the batch file in the `bin` folder. Batch files
have a cog icon next to their name.

If you're not using Windows, you should instead run the other file in the `bin` folder (called `enchcracker`,
not `enchcracker.bat`). How to ""run"" a shell script like this may differ from system to system and I
can't give instructions for every system.

You must have Java installed to run the enchantment cracker. You may install Java
from [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

## Reporting Bugs
Feel free to report bugs and ask any questions you may have on
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/EnchantmentCracker/issues), but
make sure to *search* whether anyone has reported your bug or asked
your question before.

## Building from Source
Assuming you have `git` installed, run the following commands from the
Command Prompt/Terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/Earthcomputer/EnchantmentCracker
cd EnchantmentCracker
gradlew build
```
On Linux/MacOS, run `./gradlew build` instead of `gradlew build`.

The resulting zip file may be found in the `build/distributions` folder.

Alternatively you can run directly from source without building, using
the `gradlew run` command.

## Contributing
All (sensible) contributions are welcome!

If you use Eclipse, run `gradlew eclipse` to generate an Eclipse project,
then use `File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace` inside
Eclipse. Navigate to the EnchantmentCracker folder and click import.

If you use IntelliJ IDEA, it can import the Gradle project directly.

Most contributions are accepted via
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

If you want to add translations to the project, you are welcome to do so!
You do this by adding a new `.properties` file under `resources/i18n`
representing your added language, then create a pull request adding that file.
As creating a pull request may be tricky if you are not used to coding,
translators may instead create an issue and upload their properties file, and
I will add it in myself.

Note that if you do make translations, I will not be able to update most of them in line
with the default English translations, as I do not speak those languages, so you may have
to keep them updated yourself.

357,KosmX/emotes,Java,"# Emotecraft  
a.k.a. EmoteX  

---
how to build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KosmX/emotes.git
cd emotes
./gradlew build
```
You can use `collectArtifacts` task to copy the mod files into an artifacts directory.  
```bash
./gradlew collectArtifact
cd artifacts
```
  
### Using in your mod/modpack  

`Fabric` depends on [**bendy-lib**](https://github.com/KosmX/bendy-lib), optionally [**Mod Menu**](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu)   and FabricMC mods: **Fabric-loader**, **Fabric-API**, **Minecraft**.  


`Forge` version has no dependencies (except **Forge** and **Minecraft**)  
**bendy-lib** is compiled into the forge version  

### Emotes proxy
Emotecraft is doing the emote synchronization using a server-side mod.  
In some cases it's just impossible (like when playing on a community server)
   
This is where proxy API comes in as it can redirect communication when dedicated server-side mod isn't available.  
If the server has Emotecraft (in any form) it will use that instead of using proxies.  

To implement a proxy-mod, see [emotes-proxy-template](https://github.com/KosmX/emotes-proxy-template).  
Emotecraft will invoke the proxy instance when trying to send a message,  
and you can invoke Emotecraft's receiver when you received a message. 


Modules:
--------
`emotesAPI`: common library used by Emotecraft, has no dependencies, published as **emotesAPI**  
    you can find it in my private maven server: [`https://maven.kosmx.dev`](https://maven.kosmx.dev)  
`executor`: the interface to be implemented to the modloader+MC version  
`emotesMain`: Main client-side logic    
`emotesServer`: Server-side logic    
<br>
`archCommon`: common (both Fabric and Forge) Minecraft dependent stuff. using [architectury](https://github.com/architectury/forgified-fabric-loom) loom  
`fabric`: latest fabric implementation  
`forge`: latest Forge implementation

358,ConnorGraham/Minecraft-Nintendo-Switch-Private-Server,HTML,"# Minecraft-Nintendo-Switch

Minecraft for Nintendo Switch doesn't allow connecting to Bedrock servers via IP. It only allows multiplayer by connecting to 1 of 5 pre-whitelsted public servers. Using docker, this repo contains everything necessary to connect your Nintendo Switch to your own private (or any other dedicated) server.

The basic premise is when your switch tries to connect to the Lifeboat Network, it is connecting to mco.lsbg.net. By running a local DNS service (bind9) and pointing the Switch to use your DNS service allows you to intercept the request to mco.lsbg.net and resolve it against your private (or any other dedicated) server's IP address

## Pre-requisites
1. Docker and Docker Compose
2. A static ip address for your machine running DNS
3. IP address of Minecraft BDS server

## Steps to run
1. Clone this repo
2. Edit dns/data/bind/etc/zones/db.mco.lbsg.net and replace 192.168.0.69 with the IP address of Minecraft server
3. (optional) If you want to run your own server, go to /minecraft and run 
```
docker-compose up
``` 
4. In a separate window, Run DNS by goinge to /dns and run
```
docker-compose up
```
5. Lastly, in your Nintendo Switch network settings, set the primary DNS server to the private IP address of your machine running DNS
6. Open Minecraft, go to the realms tab and connect to Lifeboat Network. You should be connecting to your private server instead!

## Instructions
There are 2 ways to set this up:

### Codespace setup
The easiest method is to use a GitHub [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (in beta). Just create a GitHub Codespace from the Code menu. Wait for the Codespace to complete provisioning. When the Codespace has completed provisioning and you open a terminal window (Ctrl-`, Control-backquote), you should see a message like this:
```
To provision infrastructure, make sure you're logged in with Azure CLI e.g. run 'az login' and 'az account set --subscription 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'. Then, either:
 - change to the /home/codespace/workspace/azure-minecraft-docker/terraform directory and run 'terraform apply', or:
 - run /home/codespace/workspace/azure-minecraft-docker/scripts/deploy.ps1 -apply
To destroy infrastructure, replace 'apply' with 'destroy' in above commands
```
Just follow these steps to provision Minecraft on Azure.
### Local setup
If you set this up locally, make sure you have the following pre-requisites:
- [Azure CLI](http://aka.ms/azure-cli)
- [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (to get that you can use [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) on Linux & macOS, [Homebrew](https://github.com/hashicorp/homebrew-tap) on macOS or [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/terraform) on Windows)

On macOS, you can run `brew bundle` to install the pre-requisites.

Once you have those, you can go ahead and provision:
- Use Azure CLI for SSO with [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/azure_cli): `az login`
- Select subscription to use: `az account set --subscription 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
- Initialize terraform: `terraform init`
- Provision cloud infrastructure: `terraform apply`

### Customization
You can customize the deployment by overriding defaults for Terraform [input variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html). The easiest way to do this is to copy [config.auto.example.tfvars](./terraform/config.auto.example.tfvars) and save it as config.auto.tfvars.
- Use the `minecraft_users` array to define users allowed to log in
- Use a custom DNS name with `vanity_dns_zone_id` and `vanity_hostname_prefix`, using an Azure DNS managed domain
- Once things get serious, you may want to start backing up data with `enable_backup`
- Are your kids home schooling on the same computer that has Minecraft installed? Configure auto shutdown & startup during weekdays with `enable_auto_startstop`, `start_time` & `stop_time`. The Logic App triggers created can be favorited in the [mobile app](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/mobile-app/) for on-demand startup & shutdown.
- Concerned about chat messages appearing in logs? `enable_log_filter` uses the [Console Spam Fix](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/console-spam-fix) and [configures](./minecraft/log-filter/config.yml) it to hide chat messages from logs. This feature is dependent on [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) and is more brittle in automation, but satisfies a key privacy requirement.

See [variables.tf](./terraform/variables.tf) for all input variables.
## Dashboard
Once provisioned, a dashboard like this will be available in the Azure Portal:   

![alt text](./visuals/dashboard.png ""Dashboard"")
You can update the dashboard in the portal and re-generate the [template](./terraform/dashboard.tpl) using [templatize_dashboard.ps1](./scripts/templatize_dashboard.ps1).

## Information 
Blaze4D is a Fabric mod that changes Minecraft's rendering engine to use the Vulkan Graphics Library, it is currently in
Early Development and is **NOT** intended for use by the faint-hearted. Support for Blaze4D can be found in the #support
Discord channel.

## Community
We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/H93wJePuWf) where you can track development progress, ask questions, or just hang out in.

## Building
### Build Requirements

 - Vulkan SDK - Version 1.3.208 or newer
 - CMake and a C++ compiler - Required for building some of our dependencies
 - Rust - Version 1.62.0 or newer
 - Java 18

### Build Steps
To build the project with natives for your platform run
```
./gradlew build
```
in the project root directory.

To run the game with the mod use any of the 3 run targets:
- `./gradlew runClient`
- `./gradlew runClientWithValidation` - Enables validation layers
- `./gradlew runClientWithValidationRenderdoc` - Enables validation layers and automatically loads the renderdoc shared library.

#### Manually building natives
To work on and test natives it can be useful to run cargo manually. To do this it's necessary to first build the assets
by running
```
./gradlew :core:assets:build
```
This only needs to be repeated if the assets are modified.

After that the natives can be manually built using cargo.

## Contributing
1. Clone the repository (https://github.com/Blaze4D-MC/Blaze4D.git).
2. Edit
3. Pull Request

## Project Structure
The project is organized in 2 parts

### Core
This is the core of Blaze4D that performs the actual rendering and is written in Rust. The gradle project contains 3
subprojects.
 - assets - These are any assets we need to bundle with Blaze4D. For example shaders or fonts. They currently need to be separately built after a change using their gradle `build` task.
 - natives - The main Blaze4D core rust code.
 - api - A java api of the rust code used by the mod.

### Mod
This is the fabric mod itself. Its job is to interface with minecraft. Most of the heavy lifting should take place in Blaze4D core."

368,microsoft/MinecraftCodex,TypeScript,"# Codex for Minecraft NPCs

This prototype uses GPT-3 Codex to power a Non-Player Character (NPC) in Minecraft. Through the discipline of ""prompt engineering"" (see section below), we show the model how to use the Minecraft SimulatedPlayer API to write code to navigate the world, mine, craft and even carry on conversation.

![Minecraft Codex gif](minecraft-codex.gif)

## Requirements

Please read the readme carefully to make sure you get the right bits. This repo works with very specific versions of Minecraft, Minecraft dedicated server, and Node, and requires setup commands to be called in specific order.

- An [OpenAI account](https://openai.com/api/)

  - [OpenAI API Key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).
  - [OpenAI Organization Id](https://beta.openai.com/account/org-settings). If you have multiple organizations, please update your [default organization](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the one that has access to codex engines before getting the organization Id.
  - [OpenAI Engine Id](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/codex-series-private-beta). The name of the Codex model you're using. This repository was primarily tested using `code-davinci-002`. See [here](#what-openai-engines-are-available-to-me) for checking available engines.

- You need to be an owner of Minecraft, or have PC GamePass, in order to use Minecraft or Minecraft Preview.
  - This sample uses a separate Dedicated Server and a Minecraft client app. For more information on Minecraft Bedrock Edition, Dedicated Server and how you can use scripting with them, see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/minecraft/creator/documents/scriptingservers).
  - This build uses the latest Minecraft version (version 1.19.0 or higher). You will need a version of Minecraft Dedicated Server, downloadable from https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock, and Minecraft client version 1.19.0 or higher, which the below links will help you to gather.
  - Note that Minecraft has both main and ""Preview"" versions of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. You can now use the main Minecraft editions to use this sample; you no longer need to use the Minecraft Preview app with this sample in particular.
  - You can access Minecraft from the MS Store here to make sure you have access: `https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PGW18NPBZV5`
  - Download the Xbox app from Microsoft Store, and sign in with your consumer MSA account (same thing as your Xbox account if you have one) `https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MV0B5HZVK9Z`
  - Open the Xbox App to install Minecraft `(https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P5X4QVLC2XR)`.
    - LTS 16.15 version of [Node.JS]`(https://nodejs.org/en/)`
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - OPTIONAL: Clear chat texture pack to make it easier to see the bot actions without the dim screen of chat. Download from here and follow install directions: `https://mcpedl.com/clear-chat-tranparent-chat/`

## Setup

1. Clone the repo wherever you like: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/MinecraftCodex.git`. The project is setup to work with your local Minecraft install.
1. Open the folder you placed the repo in locally in VSCode
1. You will get a recommendations to install Minecraft extensions to enable debugging, you want to accept those
1. Open Terminal in VSCode in the code directory, and run `npm install` to pull down the package dependencies.
1. Under the scripts folder, create a file called `vars.ts` with the following key value pairs:
   ```
   export let OPENAI_API_KEY = ""<YOUR_KEY_HERE>"";
   export let OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID = ""<YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE>"";
   export let OPENAI_ENGINE_ID = ""<YOUR_CODEX_MODEL_NAME_HERE>"";
   export let DEBUG = false;
   ```
1. Place your OpenAI API key between the quotes, and save the file.

## Install Minecraft Bedrock Edition Dedicated Server

1. Download and unzip the Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server to a location on your hard drive.
1. In the Minecraft Codex code directory, open `gulpfile.js` and update the `dedicatedServerPath` variable to the folder where your dedicated server is located. Note: it must end with a '\\' character
1. You will likely need to disable PowerShell signing requirements for the session. In the VSCode Terminal type: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` You will need to do this every time you open a new terminal, or restart VSCode. It only works on the current process, so nowhere else should this take effect.
1. Run these three commandsin the VSCode terminal, which should be in the repo folder.
   `gulp updateconfig`
   `gulp updateserver`
   `gulp updateworld`
1. Those commands will:

   - Add additional configuration files that enable this module to make net requests on Dedicated Server.
   - Update server configuration properties (`server.properties`)
   - Reset the Minecraft Dedicated Server to the default world for the Codex World.

1. The first time you run Bedrock Dedicated Server, you may see a prompt within Windows to enable ports on your firewall for public and/or private networks.
   Within the pop up Firewall prompt in Windows that you may receive, you will want to potentially enable Bedrock Server port access on your Private networks.
   Alternately, ensure at least ports 19132 and 19133 are open to Bedrock Dedicated Server via your Firewall tools.
1. Ensure that local Minecraft local clients can connect to your locally-hosted server - to do this, you need to enable 'loopback' connections for Minecraft UWP.

   To enable loopback for Minecraft on Windows, run:

   ```dotnetcli
   npm run enablemcloopback
   ```

   To enable loopback for Minecraft Preview on Windows, run:

   ```dotnetcli
   npm run enablemcpreviewloopback
   ```

1. To run the game server with proper configs and defaults, you need to use `gulp serve` from your code directory, typically from the VSCode terminal.
1. Run the dedicated server from it's directory once to get it up and running. After it has completed loading (you will see the message ""Debugger Listening"" on the console), type in the following command to ensure you have full access to controls in game.
   `op <your username>`

## Building and Deploying

1. To have it continuously re-build as you make changes, run `gulp watch`. This will stop the server and restart it with your latest code regularly.
1. The deployment step automatically moves the compiled code to a Minecraft Behavior Pack folder within your Dedicated Server.

## Connecting to the Dedicated Server

1. Open your Minecraft client and click Play. Select ""Servers"".
   The first time you play, you will need to add a server:
1. Scroll all the way down on the left side to and select Add Server
1. Type a name for the server (""local"") and use a Server Address of 127.0.0.1 if you are running Dedicated Server on the same machine.
1. Select the server, and select Join Server.

1. Open the chat (click 't') and type `/gametest run codex:codex` to spawn the Non-Player Character, along with a test structure from the BehaviorPack. When loading your world in the future, you can push the button on the command block that appears in the test structure to start the codex code running

## Debugging

Use the following steps to debug:

1. Make sure you have the Minecraft Bedrock Edition Debugger installed within Visual Studio Code, or this won't work properly, make sure it is version 0.2.0 or later
2. Running `gulp serve` in your code folder will start the server running, and then you can run the debugger from VSCode which will automatically connect to the server.
3. You can set breakpoints in the TypeScript files directly. NOTE: The code in CodexBot is not hitting breakpoints correctly, this is a known error and being looked at.

## Interacting with the NPC

Now that you've spawned the NPC into the game, you can have a multi-turn conversation with it!

1. Click 't' to open the chat and send messages to the NPC. If you interact conversationally (e.g. ""What are you up to?"" or ""What's the meaning of life?), the NPC should respond with natural language. If given a command (e.g. ""look at me"", ""move forward a bit"", etc.) the NPC should respond with code and evaluate it.
1. The NPC is able to carry-on multi-turn conversations, carrying context across conversation turns. Example:

```
Player: What's your favorite Minecraft resource'
NPC: bot.chat(""I love oak logs!"")
Player: ""Why's that?
NPC: bot.chat(""Because they're so versatile!"")
```

**Note**: The NPC isn't perfect, and sometimes the conversation can get stuck or begin repeating itself. Type ""reset"" to reset the conversational experience.

## How it Works - Prompt Engineering

The Codex model being used in this sample has never seen the SimulatedPlayer API we're asking it to use (it's a new API that wasn't in its training set). In order to get the model to use the SimulatedPlayer API, we need to engineer prompts that give the model examples of the kinds of commands it will receive and the kind of code it should write. From just a few Natual Language to Code examples, we can use the model to generate new code from new commands.

We coax the correct code and natural language out of Codex through a discipline called prompt engineering. Large Language Models like GPT-3 and Codex are trained to guess the next word in a sentence, or more generally, the next token in a sequence. They can do this continuously to genereate whole sentences, paragraphs, lines of code and functions. To coax very specific code out of the models, it's best to give prompts that convey our intent and give examples of what we're looking for.

Please note: The NPC capabilities are limited to abilities in the capabilities of the SimulatedPlayer API, along with some extra capabilities we gave it. It can walk, chat with you, walk around, look at you, follow you, mine blocks, and craft items (etc.) It can't currently use visual cues about the world around it or handle capabilities outside of the API spec. You can code new behaviors yourself and alter the prompts to enable the bot to do what you would like, and we encourage you to do so!

In the `codexPrompt` folder, you'll find the prompts used to give the model examples. You'll notice that the prompts have some general context, and are modelled as a series of comments (natural language) and code:

```js
//Minecraft bot commands, using the SimulatedPlayer library. When the comment is conversational, the bot will respond as a helpful minecraft bot. Otherwise, it will do as asked.

// Look at me
bot.lookAtEntity();

// Do that continuously
state.lookingInterval = setInterval(bot.lookAtEntity, 50);

// Stop!
state.clearInterval(state.lookingInterval);

// What's your name?
bot.chat(""My name is "" + bot.username);
```

These interactions serve as examples to the model of what the SimulatedPlayer API looks like, and also to suggest the kind of code that Codex should write. When a player calls the model with another command (e.g. ""How are you?""), we append that command onto the prompt as another comment, and ask the model to generate the next chunk of code:

```js
... examples
// What's your name?
bot.chat(""My name is "" + bot.username);

// How are you?
```

Given the examples above, it will correctly guess that the code it writes should use the `bot.chat` API, to answer something like `bot.chat(""I'm doing just fine!"")`.

As interactions (NL -> Code) continue, we continue appending them onto the prompt to maintain context on future turns. This allows Codex to resolve pronouns and understand past context when asked to do something new (e.g. know that ""that"" is looking at a player when they say ""stop doing that"").

## How it Works - Evaluating Code

Prompt engineering allows Codex to frequently produce novel code - the next step is to run that code. This is done by evaluating it. In languages like Python and JavaScript (which don't require code to be compiled), it's possible to directly evaluate a string of code using an eval function (e.g. `eval(codeString)`). Somewhat counterintuitively, the code evaluation in this sample isn't happening from the bot's side, but rather from the game - see the `evaluateCode` function in `scripts/CodexGame` to see how we use `eval` to evaluate the code we get back from the model.

## How it Works - API Design

This sample gives Codex the prompts to use the [SimulatedPlayer API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/mojang-gametest/simulatedplayer) and our extensions of the API when it generates code. Our extensions of the API give Codex several more capabilities to enable the NPC to handle more behaviors. We did this to enable higher-level code generation, giving the NPC the primitives it needs to accomplish more complex behaviors. As an example, you wouldn't want a model to use primitive movement functions (move left, move right, etc.) to navigate from point A to point B - this might require the model to write hundreds of lines of code. Instead, you may consider authoring a function that abstracts this kind of navigation away (e.g. `bot.extendedNavTo(position)`) that the model can then invoke.

Also important in designing an API is having consistent naming conventions and limiting the namespaces in which the model is expected to write code. Like a developer, the model will more effectively used a well-abstacted, consistently named API. We have added our own APIs as fronts to SimulatedPlayer in order to enable this consistency.

## Extending NPC Capabilities

You can extend the abilities of this NPC by building your own prompts, adding more examples of the kinds of code you expect the model to write. If you want to implement entirely new behaviors (e.g. attacking mobs), you may need to extend the API with new functions (e.g. a function called `attackEntity(entity)`).

## A Note on Fine Tuning

This example shows how we can enable Codex to generate a specific API's code by example, through prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is often a good place to start when assessing a Large Language Model's ability to generate language and code. Prompt engineering has limits though - prompts can only be so large, model performance worsens as more concepts are introduced, and larger prompts take longer to process and use more compute resources.

To improve a Large Language model's ability to understand a specific domain, you can fine tune a model - effectively re-training it with a corpus of code, example interactions, documentation and other context. In the case of the Minecraft bot, we could significantly improve the bot's abilities by fine-tuning a model with the entire SimulatedPlayer API documentation, examples of interactions between players and the NPC, information about Minecraft, and more.

## Important Info on the GameTest APIs

GameTest is a beta API from the Minecraft team, and is subject to change with updates. We will work to keep this repo up to date with new releases. The documentation is currently being written, so there are a few things to be aware of, as noted in the next section.

## Important Tips

- If you edit the manifest.json file, ignore any warnings it gives you about the existing file
- Also, if you edit the manifest.json file, do not change the first two entries in dependencies, these are required
- If there is an error in your test being registered, (like you didn't import GameTest), you won't get any notification of what is wrong
- So make sure you can verify your entry point is working before you do a lot of crazy work (like I did). The best way to do this is to type the following into the console:

`/gametest run [your class]::[yourtestname]`

If you don't see the console trying to autocomplete to your test, then you have a problem with your entry point.

## Code Structure

1. main.ts is where the code pack is registered and we pass in the tickMain function to run every game tick (20 times per second)
2. tickMain calls into an instance of CodexGame, which handles the game logic, creates the CodexBot, and manages state logic for the bot
3. CodexGame is also where we call `eval()` to run the generated code.
4. CodexBot is a wrapper around the SimulatedPlayer class from Minecraft, which handles the bot's logic
5. Crafting class is a static class that manages a database of recipes and will remove items from the bot and return to it the item if it can craft the item. It's not a true ""crafting"" function so you can alter it to not remove items from the bot, or to give the bot exactly what it needs to craft, or even just give the bot the item you want it to have directly.
6. The prompt class manages the text input to Codex that informs it of how we expect input to be delivered. In this case, we are using the .\prompts\combinedPrompts.ts file.
7. TimedQueue is a class to manage promise chaining with wait functions to create complex behaviors
8. The GameTest APIs can be viewed in the node_modules/@types folder. They are mojang-gametest, mojang-minecraft and mojang-net. mojang-net is included with the source depot and copied into the node_modules folder. The others are npm packages.
9. The .vscode json files include info on which code modules we are importing from Minecraft, and request download of the required extensions for VSCode
10. The actions taken by gulp are managed by the gulpfile.js file. It transpiles the Typescript to Javascript, and copies the files to the correct locations.
11. All functions that are act on or are part of SimulatedPlayer are relative to a zero point of where the GameTest structure manifests. You will see code in CodexBot that ensures positions are updated correctly.
12. The location you read out of SimulatedPlayer is a world location, and is NOT relative to anything
13. There are two location types: BlockLocation and Location. You will find yourself having to convert back and forth dependin on the types the functions are requesting
14. Properties of most GameTest objects can be queried through getComponent() and passing in a string value. You can enumerate the components through getComponents() on the same object.

369,bleroy/minecraft.client,C#,"Decent .NET Minecraft Client
============================

A .NET client library for the original (Java) version of Minecraft.
It requires Forge and the Raspberry Jam mod on the Minecraft side.

How to use it
-------------

Requirements: Minecraft (the Java version, not the micro edition or the Windows 10 edition),
[Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), and the [Raspberry Jam Mod](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod/releases)].

Reference the library, then you can open a connection and start scripting the Minecraft
world:

```csharp
using (var world = JavaWorld.Connect())
{
    world.PostToChat(""Hello from C# and .NET Core!"");
    var originBlock = world.GetBlockType(0, 0, 0);
    world.PostToChat($""Origin block is {originBlock}."");
}
```

![Scripting Minecraft from C#](decent.minecraft.png)

Status
------

This is just a hack at this point: only a minimal number of APIs is implemented,
but the general infrastructure is in place, and the code can actually script Minecraft
from C#, which is pretty awesome in itself.

How does it work?
-----------------

There's [a Minecraft mod that enables scripting Minecraft in Python called Raspberry Jam
Mod](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod/releases).
The way that mod works is with a small Java mod that lives in Minecraft, accepting socket
connections from a Python client and then exchanging text-based messages that on the wire
look like function calls:

```
world.getBlock(1,0,0)
```

The interesting thing is that there is nothing specific about Python in that protocol:
it's just messages getting exchanged over a socket, which .NET will be happy to emulate.

What I did is to reverse-engineer the Python client code and re-implement it in C#.

Where is this going?
--------------------

Eventually, I'd like to expose the entire Minecraft API with a nice object model,
and to be able to start the C# scripts from the Minecraft console.
That would effectively make it possible to write mods in C#, with a thin Java driver.

CSX support would be nice as well.

I also want to be able to run this with Mono (that should actually already work,
this is just .NET Standard) on a Raspberry Pi: the protocol that Raspberry Jam implements
is natively present on the Raspberry Pi version.

Building from source
--------------------

The project must now be built with [csproj-based tooling (Visual Studio 2017 with Core tooling or .NET Core CLI Preview 3 or later)](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core).

Can I help? - Up for grabs
--------------------------

Sure. Just let me know what you'd like to work on, so we don't duplicate efforts, but yes,
hacking is highly encouraged.

### Blocks

This is an easy contribution.

There's a couple hundred blocks to implement. Some of them, such as `Diamond`, are very simple,
and some are a little more complex, such as `Fire`.
In some cases, such as `Clay`, a class hierarchy makes sense.

If you're interested in implementing blocks, look at the existing blocks in the `Blocks` folder,
then choose one from the `BlockType` enum that doesn't exist yet and implement it.
A block is a class that derives from `Block`.
In the simplest case, the class is empty:

```csharp
public class Diamond : IBlock {}
```

The block class is only part of the implementation, that is supposed to be a simple data structure
with no knowledge of the communication protocol with Minecraft.
The code that does know about the protocol must be implemented in `JavaBlock`, in the `JavaBlock`
static constructor, and in the `public static JavaBlock From(Block block)` method.

The static constructor describes how to instantiate the correct block type from data that was
passed in. In simple cases, there is no data, and no need to implement construction logic.

When blocks have data, the block contruction logic must build the correct block from the wire data:

```csharp
_ctors[Id<Farmland>()] = d => new Farmland(d);
```

In more complex cases, the data must be decomposed and the corresponding properties must be set
on the block object.

The reverse operation implemented in the `From` method is recreating a `JavaBlock` ready to be
transmitted to Minecraft from a concrete block.
If the block you're implementing has no data, nothing has to be implemented, and this part can be
skipped.

The description of the format of the data for each block type that has data can be found in The
[Minecraft documentation wiki Data values page](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_values).

### Entities

Entities will be an easy contribution once I've started creating the basic infrastructure.

### Tests

This is an easy to medium contribution.

There are lots of blocks that need testing of their serialization and deserialization logic. We also need tests for infrastructure pieces such as `JavaWorld`. Finally, we'll ultimately need functional tests.

### Commands

This is a medium difficulty contribution.

Very few commands are currently implemented: you can echo messages to the chat using `PostToChat`,
you can get the position of the player using `Player.GetPosition`, and you can get or set a block using
`GetBlock` and `SetBlock`.
Many more commands need to be implemented.
You can find the list of commands and their Python implementation [in the Raspberry Jam Mod GitHub repository](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod/blob/master/mcpipy/mcpi/minecraft.py).
Make sure you implement both an asynchronous and a synchronous version of each method.
Finally, once you've implemented a command, don't forget to add it to the `IWorld` interface.

### New protocols

This is a difficult contribution.

Currently, this library can only talk to the Java implementation of Minecraft, and to the Raspberry
Pi version (hopefully, I haven't verified it yet).
The code is architected so that it should be possible to implement alternative protocols by
reimplementing `JavaConnection`, `JavaWorld`, and `JavaBlock`.
This way, a single API could in theory be used to script other versions of the Minecraft client and
of Minecraft servers.

Tips and tricks
---------------

It is useful, while developing scripts, to be able to switch to another application without the game going into pause. This can be done by editing the `options.txt` file under your Minecraft folder (`%appdata%\.minecraft\` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/` on macOS, and `~/.minecraft/` on Linux) and setting `pauseOnLostFocus` to `false`."

372,vram-guild/canvas,Java,"# Canvas
Canvas is a shader-based Renderer for the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) modding toolchain.  It supports all features of the proposed [Fabric Rendering API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/pull/65) plus extensions defined in [FREX](https://github.com/grondag/frex).

Discord: https://discord.gg/7NaqR2e
Curse: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer

## License
Except as noted in individual source files, all code in this mod, include shaders, is [licensed under the LGPL-3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html). This means no warranty is provided.

Some elements of code are adapted from or copied from other projects with compatible licensing.  The author has attempted to provide credit and/or appropriate notices in the code where applicable.

## Limitations
Canvas is in EARLY ALPHA.  Expect it to break.

The FREX extensions, shader library, vertex formats, attribute bindings, and lighting options are subject to change - causing your code to break.  Sorry.  When there is a stable release I will avoid breaking changes in shipping versions.  Until then, experimentation is the norm.

## Why
When people first hear about Canvas they often ask if it is a performance mod or a replacement for Optifine / shader packs.  The answer is ""no, but...""

Optifine and shader packs primarily target vanilla Minecraft.  They work with modded, often well, but they aren't designed as tools for *mod authors*.

Canvas' main purpose is to give mod authors more control and options for rendering modded blocks.  It can also be used for building shader packs, but the design is entirely different than OF and does not yet support all the features needed for a full shader pack implementation.  Unlike OF shader packs, Canvas shader packs can be mixed together by adding multiple resource packs. 

## Performance
Performance-wise, Canvas tries to be be faster than Vanilla with extended features. It is optimized heavily - but the intent of these changes is to make better rendering practical, not to be a general-purpose performance mod. It isn't meant to run on low-end hardware and may or may not make your game run faster overall.

Canvas will try to fully use your hardware and will not be timid about it. It wants at least 4GB and will push both your CPU and GPU.  It will stress your cooling system.

If you're looking to max performance with Canvas, the config menu tool tips indicate which features can help.  Bloom is especially expensive at high resolutions.  But bloom is also fun to look at, so.... your call. 

More optimizations will be added after a stable release.

# Using Canvas

## Installing Canvas
Add Canvas to the `mods` folder in your minecraft folder (`%appdata%/.minecraft/mods` on Windows) and make sure you have recent versions of [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) Loader and API, plus at least 4GB of memory allocated to Minecraft.  An in-game config menu is available in video options, or via Mod Menu if you have it installed.

## Compatible Shader Packs

Third-party pipeline shaders:
* [Lumi Lights](https://spiralhalo.github.io/)
* [Forget-me-not](https://github.com/Poisoned-Honey/ForgetMeNot-Shaders)
* [lomo (wip)](https://github.com/fewizz/lomo/)

This list is updated infrequently.

More releases can be found in [`#canvas-3rd-party-releases` channel](https://discord.com/channels/614624415631671316/752632870257950790) on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/7NaqR2e).

# Developing With Canvas
Before using Canvas, you should first understand RenderMaterials, Meshes, RenderContexts and other features defined by the Fabric Rendering API.  For that information, consult the [rendering article on the Fabric Wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/rendering). Note: Fabric wiki is still WIP as of this writing but should be more complete ""soon.""

You can also see [RenderBender](https://github.com/grondag/renderbender) for some (not very good) examples of usage.  Avoid duplicating those examples directly - they aren't especially performant or suitable for use at scale.  As soon as someone releases a model loader / library for Fabric Rendering API / FREX, that will almost certainly be a better approach.

## Attaching Shaders to Materials

Shaders can be attached to materials via json, which is the preferred way. Your materials are located in `materials/` within your namespaced resource location.

### assets/example/materials/test_material.json
```json
{
	""vertexSource"": ""example:shaders/test.vert"",
	""fragmentSource"": ""example:shaders/test.frag""
}
```

The paths in `vertexSource` and `fragmentSource` should point to GLSL files in your resources location.  The relative path and file extension must be included, and `shaders/` is the suggested location but not mandatory.

Afterwards, you can map a blockstate (or entity, particle, etc) to your material using a material map located in `materialmaps/`, like so:

### assets/example/materialmaps/block/test_block.json
```json
{
  ""defaultMaterial"": ""example:test_material""
}
```

You can also load the material directly into java

```java
Renderer renderer = Renderer.get();

// obtain the loaded material, done after resource reload
RenderMaterial mat = renderer.materials().materialFromId(new ResourceLocation(""example:test_material""));
```

Note that loading materials directly is only necessary for rendering custom meshes. For full blocks, entities, particles, or fluids, using material maps is the recommended way.

Alternatively, materials can also be created directly in java, like so:

```java
Renderer renderer = Renderer.get();

RenderMaterial mat = renderer.materials().materialFinder().shader(
		new ResourceLocation(""example"", ""shaders/test.vert""),
		new ResourceLocation(""example"", ""shaders/test.frag"")
	).find();
```

This can be more reliable in case you don't want your materials to be affected by resource packs or resource reload. In this case, material maps can't be utilized.

## Writing Material Shaders

Your vertex and fragment shaders must have a `frx_materialVertex` and `frx_materialFragment` procedures respectively. To ensure compatibility, shaders are limited to `#version 330` features.

A detailed documentation of the available API can be found in the FREX source files:
* [FREX Shader API Overview](https://github.com/vram-guild/frex/blob/1.18/common/src/main/resources/assets/frex/shaders/api/FREX%20Shader%20API.md)
* [ FREX Shader API Header Files](https://github.com/vram-guild/frex/tree/1.18/common/src/main/resources/assets/frex/shaders/api)

## Adding Canvas to your project
Add these maven repos to your build if not already present

```gradle
repositories {
	// vram guild repo
	maven {url ""https://maven.vram.io""}
	// cloth config / used by canvas dependencies
	maven {url ""https://maven.shedaniel.me/""}
	// spruce ui / current ui library
	maven {url ""https://maven.gegy.dev""}
	// mod menu
	maven {url ""https://maven.terraformersmc.com/releases/""}
}
```

And add Canvas to your dependencies

```gradle
dependencies {
	modCompileOnly ""io.vram:canvas-fabric-mc118:1.0.+""

	// optional for testing in dev environment
	modRuntimeOnly ""io.vram:canvas-fabric-mc118:1.0.+""
}
```

## Why aren't there many API additions?

(Modified from [starlis/empirecraft](https://github.com/starlis/empirecraft/))
<p>
APIs are tough to design. In projects such as Bukkit, Spigot, Sponge, Paper, etc once an API is committed, it's almost forever. You can't go breaking it without solid justification. This is the politics game.

With that in mind, much thought has to be given to the API in now and future use cases and applications to ensure it can be extended without breaking.

This is a lot of politics that we don't have time in our lives to deal with. 

That being said we make light API additions when requested.

The requirements for running the server are:
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

To download, build, and start the server:

Change config.xml 'dbuser' property to your MySQL/MariaDB default user (usually root).
Change docker-compose.yml and .env to use your domain and certificate.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/minecrafthome/minecrafthome.git
cd minecrafthome
docker-compose up -d
```

At this point, you should be able to visit [localhost](http://localhost:80/minecrafthome) from your browser to see the server webpage. You may also connect BOINC client to this local server using the same URL.

377,FabricMC/fabric,Java,"# Fabric API

Essential hooks for modding with Fabric.

Fabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:

- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions
- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.
- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.
- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.

Also check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.

For support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).

## Using Fabric API to play with mods

Make sure you have install fabric loader first. More information about installing Fabric Loader can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

To use Fabric API, download it from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/releases) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).

The downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods` folder.

## Using Fabric API to develop mods

To setup a Fabric development environment, check out the [Fabric example mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) and follow the instructions there. The example mod already depends on Fabric API.

To include the full Fabric API with all modules in the development environment, add the following to your `dependencies` block in the gradle buildscript:

### Groovy DSL

```groovy
modImplementation ""net.fabricmc.fabric-api:fabric-api:FABRIC_API_VERSION""
```

### Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
modImplementation(""net.fabricmc.fabric-api:fabric-api:FABRIC_API_VERSION"")
```

Alternatively, modules from Fabric API can be specified individually as shown below (including module jar to your mod jar):

### Groovy DSL

```groovy
// Make a collection of all api modules we wish to use
Set<String> apiModules = [
    ""fabric-api-base"",
    ""fabric-command-api-v1"",
    ""fabric-lifecycle-events-v1"",
    ""fabric-networking-api-v1""
]

// Add each module as a dependency
apiModules.forEach {
    include(modImplementation(fabricApi.module(it, FABRIC_API_VERSION)))
}
```

### Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
// Make a set of all api modules we wish to use
setOf(
    ""fabric-api-base"",
    ""fabric-command-api-v1"",
    ""fabric-lifecycle-events-v1"",
    ""fabric-networking-api-v1""
).forEach {
    // Add each module as a dependency
    modImplementation(fabricApi.module(it, FABRIC_API_VERSION))
}
```

<!--Linked to gradle documentation on properties-->
Instead of hardcoding version constants all over the build script, Gradle properties may be used to replace these constants. Properties are defined in the `gradle.properties` file at the root of a project. More information is available [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/organizing_gradle_projects.html#declare_properties_in_gradle_properties_file).

## Contributing

See something Fabric API doesn't support, a bug or something that may be useful? We welcome contributions to improve Fabric API.
Make sure to read [the development guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Modules

Fabric API is designed to be modular for ease of updating. This also has the advantage of splitting up the codebase into smaller chunks.

Each module contains its own `README.md`* explaining the module's purpose and additional info on using the module.

\* The README for each module is being worked on; not every module has a README at the moment

[Compile Schematica](#compile-schematica)

[Updating Your Repository](#updating-your-repository)

#### Setup Java
The Java JDK is used to compile Schematica.

1. Download and install the Java JDK.
    * [Windows/Mac download link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). Scroll down, accept the `Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for Java SE`, and download it (if you have a 64-bit OS, please download the 64-bit version).
    * Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).
        * Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin`
        * Archlinux: `pacman -S jdk7-openjdk`
        * Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk`
        * Fedora: `yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk`
2. Set up the environment.
    * Windows: Set environment variables for the JDK.
        1. Go to `Control Panel\System and Security\System`, and click on `Advanced System Settings` on the left-hand side.
        2. Click on `Environment Variables`.
        3. Under `System Variables`, click `New`.
        4. For `Variable Name`, input `JAVA_HOME`.
        5. For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_45` exactly as shown (or wherever your Java JDK installation is), and click `Ok`.
        6. Scroll down to a variable named `Path`, and double-click on it.
        7. Append `;%JAVA_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `Ok`. Make sure the location is correct; double-check just to make sure.
3. Open up your command line and run `javac`. If it spews out a bunch of possible options and the usage, then you're good to go. If not try the steps again.

#### Setup Git
Git is used to clone Schematica and update your local copy.

1. Download and install Git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/).
2. *Optional* Download and install a Git GUI client, such as Github for Windows/Mac, SmartGitHg, TortoiseGit, etc. A nice list is available [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

#### Setup Schematica
This section assumes that you're using the command-line version of Git.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to a place where you want to download Schematica's source (eg `C:\Development\Github\Minecraft\`) by executing `cd [folder location]`. This location is known as `mcdev` from now on.
3. Execute `git clone git@github.com:Lunatrius/Schematica.git`. This will download Schematica's source into `mcdev`.
4. Right now, you should have a directory that looks something like:

***
    mcdev
    \-Schematica
        \-Schematica's files (should have build.gradle)
***

#### Compile Schematica
1. Execute `gradlew setupDevWorkspace`. This sets up Forge and downloads the necessary libraries to build Schematica. This might take some time, be patient.
    * You will generally only have to do this once until the Forge version in `gradle.properties` changes.
2. Execute `gradlew build`. If you did everything right, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` will be displayed after it finishes. This should be relatively quick.
    * If you see `BUILD FAILED`, check the error output (it should be right around `BUILD FAILED`), fix everything (if possible), and try again.
3. Go to `mcdev\Schematica\build\libs`.
    * You should see a `.jar` file named `Schematica-#.#.#-#.#.#.#-universal.jar`.
4. Copy the jar into your Minecraft mods folder, and you are done!

#### Updating Your Repository
In order to get the most up-to-date builds, you'll have to periodically update your local repository.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to `mcdev` in the console.
3. Make sure you have not made any changes to the local repository, or else there might be issues with Git.
    * If you have, try reverting them to the status that they were when you last updated your repository.
4. Execute `git pull master`. This pulls all commits from the official repository that do not yet exist on your local repository and updates it.

Provide several useful functions to build a Minecraft Launcher.

Most packages are targeting the [Electron](https://electronjs.org) environment. Feel free to report issues related to it.

### Looking for C# Launcher Core?

Introduce the awesome .net framework launcher core, [ProjBobcat](https://github.com/Corona-Studio/ProjBobcat).

It's the next generation Minecraft launcher core written in C# providing the freest, fastest and the most complete experience. https://craftmine.fun

### Featured Launcher

- [x-minecraft-launcher](https://github.com/voxelum/x-minecraft-launcher): An launcher provides general electron api related to minecraft launching (in renderer side), making other developers can easily create new launcher view.
- [PureLauncher](https://github.com/Apisium/PureLauncher): An awesome Minecraft Launcher using React to build beautiful UI.


## Installation & Usage

This repo maintaining multiple mini packages for specific functions.

If you use electron to write a minimum launcher, you can install `@xmcl/core` which only has such functions:

- Parse existed Minecraft version
- Launch the game

If you have bigger ambition on your launcher, you want it be able to download/install Minecraft, then you can have `@xmcl/installer`, which contains the functions of:

- Get the version information of Minecraft/Forge/Liteloader/Fabric
- Install Minecraft/Forge/Liteloader/Fabric to the game folder

If you still not satisfied, as you want even provide the function to parse existed resource pack and mods under game folder, then you will have `@xmcl/mod-parser` and `@xmcl/resourcepack` modules, which contain such functions:

- Parse Forge/Liteloader/Fabric mods metadata
- Parse resource pack metadata

There are more packages for advantage usages, and you can check out the getting started section to navigate.

### Bundle & Treeshaking

The module built with `ES5` module option by typescript. To use treeshake, please make sure your bundle system support esm import/export.

Some bundler like webpack, rollup support treeshake by default. Just make sure you dont do something like `import * as SomeNamespace from ...`, which will bundle the whole package.
(But `import { xxx } from 'xxx'` will still work)

### CommonJS

If you don't have a bundler to transform the package, you can still use it in cjs. The webpack will pick the `""main""` field in `package.json` which is pointing to the cjs version.

It means you don't need to do anything in extra ideally.

### Electron Version

Recommend to use the latest electron, so you don't need to setup babel with webpack 4.

## Getting Started

> Please respect the typescript interface and jsdoc in type definition if the markdown document is outdated. Contact the developer if you find the document outdated or mismatched!

- MineTweaker3-API is the shared API for all MineTweaker versions
- MineTweaker3-MCXYZ-Main are the main MineTweaker implementations for Minecraft X.Y.Z
- MineTweaker3-MCXYZ-Mod-XXX are the mod support projects. They are compiled and obfuscated independently and then assembled later

### Developing and running MineTweaker from source

Configuration settings are stored in configuration.gradle . *If buildSrc fails to compile you might have to edit the
+`javaToolsJar` location in `configuration.gradle`*

In order to use the project, you have to execute the setupDecompWorkspaceAll (or use setupDecomWorkspace17X if you have errors on the 1.6.4 forge patches). It will prepare all the subprojects for you. After that, you can simply run minecraft with the runClient task in MineTweaker3-XYZ-Main project, which will run MineTweaker (without mod support). Likewise, you can use the runClient task on any of its mod support library subprojects, which will run MineTweaker with only the mod support for that specific mod.

The following global tasks are available:

- setupDecompWorkspaceAll: sets up all workspaces in all subprojects
- setupDecompWorkspace17X: sets up all workspaces for anything that's not 1.6.4
- assembleMC164: builds MineTweaker for Minecraft 1.6.4
- assembleMC172: builds MineTweaker for Minecraft 1.7.2
- assembleMC1710: builds MineTweaker for Minecraft 1.7.10
- assembleAll: builds all versions of MineTweaker

### Adding mod support

When starting a new mod support library, it is best to start from an existing one. For instance, copy the NEI support library, and remove the source files inside the src/java/main directory. Then you can work with it like any other support library. Make sure to update configuration.gradle to add the projects in there.

### Building a release

Use the assembleAll task to build all versions, or assembleMCxxx tasks to build a specific version. The files will be output in /build/libs .

## Customized builds

You may modify and redistribute your own customized version of MineTweaker as long as you mark your own version of MineTweaker as CUSTOMIZED (that is, put CUSTOMIZED in both the jar and mod name) and as long as you make the modified source code publicly available. Obviously, I cannot offer support for customized builds. Just be so kind to mention the original source and author (me) ;)

## [Download link](https://github.com/tryashtar/image-map/releases)

This is a simple Windows application that converts images to Minecraft maps using the latest colors. It works for both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition.

## How to Use

### <img src=""ImageMap4/Icons/world.png"" width=16> Worlds Tab

Here you can see a list of your Java and Bedrock worlds. Click on any one to open it. By default, the program looks in these folders:
* `%appdata%\.minecraft\saves`
* `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds`

If you have worlds saved elsewhere, such as on a server or in Education Edition, you can click the buttons to change where to look.

You can also drag and drop a world folder directly onto the program to open it, no matter where it is.

### <img src=""ImageMap4/Icons/map.png"" width=16> Maps Tab

**In World**

On the right, you'll see maps that are already in your world, if any. Click on maps to select them.

For getting those maps on a wall easily, click ""Generate Structure."" Your selected maps will be arranged in a grid, and a structure block will be added to your inventory. Place it and load the structure to get your maps!

You can also delete maps or change their ID. Don't worry, everything can be undone with <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd>.

**Importing**

On the left, you can import images to convert into maps.

All Minecraft maps must be 128x128 pixels, and Java Edition has a limited color palette, so there are a few options to control how your image should be modified.

You can split it into multiple maps, change the scaling mode, and choose the color distance and dithering algorithms. See which one you like best.

When you're ready, click ""Send All to World"" to transfer your maps to the world. If ""Create structures"" is checked, you'll automatically get a structure block in your inventory that can be used to place the maps on a wall.

### Version Palettes

For Java Edition, the program detects the version of your world to determine which colors are available. Here are all the supported palettes:

==========

CraftGuide is a Minecraft mod started back in October 2011, with the intention of providing the functionality of Risugami's Recipe Book, but a user interface which could better handle the absurd number of recipes encountered when playing with certain mods.

Since then, it has slowly developed features to enhance the main functionality, such as making the GUI resizable to comfortably handle screens of all sizes at all GUI scales, and adding an API so that other mods can display recipes which wouldn't normally be visible (such as those for machines, or custom implementations of IRecipe).

>A Powerful Minecraft Automatic-Economy Plugin for ```1.13-1.19``` with many features!
<img src=""https://github.com/Unprotesting/Auto-Tune/blob/master/.github/AtLogo.png?raw=true"" width=""100""/>

## :star: Overview

*Auto-Tune is a Minecraft plugin that allows you to create an automated economy for your server. Prices of items will be automatically adjusted based on supply and demand. When an item is purchased by many players but sold by few, Auto-Tune will raise the price to lower demand/increase supply and vice versa. Auto-Tune fixes a critical problem in Minecraft server economies and provides a better experience for players and servers. You can check out our feature set below.*

## :heavy_check_mark: Features

- :ballot_box_with_check: ```Advanced automatic pricing model based on supply and demand```
- :ballot_box_with_check: ```Configurable GUI shop, with positioning and naming options```
- :ballot_box_with_check: ```Easy selling panel to sell items quickly```

- :ballot_box_with_check: ```All messages are configurable```
- :ballot_box_with_check: ```Tutorial to help new players```
- :ballot_box_with_check: ```And much, much more...```

## :question: Why use Auto-Tune

Auto-Tune identifies and fixes a significant problem in Minecraft servers that has remained underdeveloped and ignored for too long. This issue is the poor implementation of an economy and markets into Minecraft.

Previous solutions that allow for trading between players have lacked flexibility, player engagement, and realism. These issues are due to server economy plugins that cannot adapt to the speed at which the economy in Minecraft changes. We designed Auto-Tune with this in mind. By automating the price-setting process, server admins can sit back and watch the prices fluctuate as the supply and demand of items bounce back and forth.

Not only does this assist administrators in managing a server's economy, but it also allows the server players to engage with the economy more rigorously. We have strenuously tested Auto-Tune to be fit for any environment and created systems designed to assist server admins in building the best economy possible for the specific needs of their server. Auto-Tune is a powerful and highly customizable plugin that has a feature set rich enough to satisfy any server. We at Auto-Tune are passionate and optimistic about Minecraft plugin development and building a community that loves Minecraft and economics!

Development versions can be found under the [actions](https://github.com/Unprotesting/Auto-Tune/actions) tab on Github (where each commit produces a build artifact which is the latest version of the plugin).
2. Please use [Paper](https://papermc.io/) or a fork of Paper as your server software.
3. Make sure the required dependencies are installed ([Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) and an economy plugin such as [Essentials](https://essentialsx.net))
4. Put the ```.jar``` files in the ```/plugins``` folder of your server.
5. Start/restart the server.
6. Edit your configuration settings in ```config.yml```, ```shops.yml``` and ```messages.yml```.
7. Restart the server again and Auto-Tune will be running with all your settings configured.

### :hammer: Building from source

1. Clone the project to a local directory using ```git clone https://github.com/Unprotesting/Auto-Tune.git```.
2. Run ```cd Auto-Tune``` to enter the Auto-Tune folder.
3. Run ```./gradlew build``` to build the project using Gradle.
4. Navigate to the ```/builds/libs/``` directory and ```Auto-Tune-0.x.x``` will be there if the build was successful.

NPCLib – Basic non-player character library.<br>

This is an API made specifically for spigot servers (Minecraft). Current supported versions: **1.8.8 - latest**. Lightweight replacement for Citizens. NPCLib only uses packets instead of registering the entity in the actual Minecraft server.

## Developers

### Usage

There are multiple ways you can make use of NPCLib.

1. The first option is to shade `npclib-plugin.jar` in to your plugin.
2. The second option is to put `npclib-plugin.jar` under your `plugins` folder. By doing this, you no longer need to shade the API JAR. Though, do not forget to add `NPCLib` as a dependency in your `plugin.yml`!
3. The third option (and the one I recommend most) is to shade the library using Maven. I recently added NPCLib to the OSSRH (OSS Repository Hosting) which allows you to easily import NPCLib into your project.

#### Maven repository
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>ossrh</id>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

#### Maven dependency

If you have NPCLib under your `plugins` folder, you may use the following:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.jitse</groupId>
        <artifactId>npclib-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.11.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
If you do not want to have NPCLib in your `plugins` folder, you need to use the `npclib-plugin` artifact and [shade it](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/) accordingly.

Always make sure to use the latest stable release. [Click here](https://github.com/JitseB/NPCLib/releases/latest) to view the latest release.

#### Repacking the library
To make sure the classes won't be twice at the same place. I recommend repacking the library into your package. (Otherwise [issue #79](https://github.com/MinecraftLibraries/NPCLib/issues/79) might occur.) You can do that as follow:
```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.1.0</version>
      <!-- Do not include the <configuration>...</configuration> part if you are using Sponge! -->
      <configuration>
        <relocations>
          <relocation>
            <pattern>net.jitse.npclib</pattern>
            <!-- Replace this with your package! -->
            <shadedPattern>your.package</shadedPattern>
          </relocation>
        </relocations>
      </configuration>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>package</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>shade</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```
#### Tutorial
**[Click here](https://github.com/JitseB/NPCLib/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) for an elaborate explanation on how to use NPCLib in your next project.**

### Versioning
For NPCLib I use the follow versioning system:
* 1.x.x: Where the 1 indicates the major version of the library. When this number changes, it's highly likely there're big API changes.
* x.1.x: Where the 1 indicates the minor version of the library. When this number changes, a feature is added or a high priority bug is fixed.
* x.x.1: Where the 1 indicates another minor version of the library. When this number changes, a small bug has been fixed.

### Building your own version

1. [Download](https://github.com/JitseB/NPCLib/archive/master.zip) or clone this repository.
2. You can build the project using `mvn clean install`.

The API JAR will be under `/api/target/` and the plugin JAR (which includes all necessary NMS code) will be under `/plugins/target/`.

> # 介绍 (Introduction)

## （零）序
本项目是基于《我的世界》游戏风格的仿造，仿造原则是：  
在原版风格基础上**创新性地**增加游戏**真实性**，但拒绝完全复制（体现在“*仿*”字），
同时处理好创新与真实的关系，既在创新之中体现真实，又在真实之中发展创新，故名之***两个原则***  
《我的世界》风格的界面仅是一个*载体*和*躯壳*，却非真正的*灵魂*所在。

### 三个战略
目前，本项目仍处在初级发展阶段，bug和性能方面都不是很好。对此，根据*真实性原则*，需要坚持*三个战略*（即*改革优化创新战略*）：
1. ***改革***：泛指修bug与代码体系修改；
3. ***优化***：泛指不断提高运行速度，增加FPS，减小CPU及内存占用等；
2. ***创新***：泛指不断发展新功能。

目前阶段，这三个战略缺一不可，并且是当前发展中需长期坚持的主要及重要战略。


## （一）总述
本项目使用兼容多平台的JavaScript(ES6+)+HTML(HTML5+)+CSS3编写，利用WebGL技术，依赖Three.js进行更便捷的3D渲染。  
> 之所以选择JavaScript+HTML+CSS是因为便于绘制图形化界面（HTML5+CSS3），并易于打包成EXE(electron)和APK(HTML5+)以兼容各个平台

规定：世界中的每1px为1cm，每100px为1m，每个*普通方块*为边长1m=100cm=100px的立方体。
> 注：*deskgood*~~为某初中同桌的外号~~，作为游戏主角名，莫要在意名称![](https://img.shields.io/github/search/wzh656/MinecraftWeb/deskgood)


## （二）操作方式(Operation)
> ### 电脑版

| 事件						| 操作												|
| -------------------------	| -------------------------------------------------	|
| `W S A D`					| *前 后 左 右*方向移动(move)						|
| *鼠标左键*				| 删除所指位置的方块(remove)						|
| *鼠标右键*				| 在所指位置放置手中选中方块(place)				|
| *鼠标中键*				| 重置时间流速(1.0倍)								|
| *鼠标滚轮*				| 来回切换手中选中方块									|
| `shift`+*鼠标滚轮*		| 以1.5倍比例调节时间流速								|
| *空格*					| 跳跃(jump)										|

> ### 手机版（触屏版）

1. 移动：左边的大圆
    摇杆操作，`touch`移动控制行走，拖拽超过`100px`疾跑
2. 跳跃：右边的小圆
    可以与移动同时操作。  
    按下(`touch-start`)之后，如果脚下有方块并且距离上一次跳跃超过约1s（需有休息时长），
    则将沿着y轴正半轴方向以约5m/s的速度跳起来
3. 滑动屏幕界面：转动角色视角
4. 短按屏幕界面：`touch`<1s
	放置('deskgood.put')当前手中选中的方块到点击处
5. 长按屏幕界面：`touch`>1s
	删除('deskgood.delete')点击处的方块并将其放入手中（优先放入选中处）
6. 点击下方工具栏方块：
	选中手中的方块


## （三）引入的调试工具（Shift+F3关闭/显示）
由于项目长期处于调试状态，调试工具可能默认开启，调试工具可能影响游戏性能，若无需使用请按`Shift`+`F3`关闭

+ > *state.js*：左上角Canvas
    
    可以使用该工具查看当前渲染状态，该工具有3种状态，点击切换
    + fps:<font style=""color:blue;"">蓝色/fps</font>  
        查看当前每秒可渲染的帧数，1s更新1次
    + ms:<font style=""color:green;"">绿色/ms</font>  
        查看渲染每帧需要的时间/ms，渲染1帧更新1次
    + MB:<font style=""color:red;"">红色/MB</font>  
        查看当前运行占用的内存/MB(兆字节)

+ > *dat.gui.js*：右上角
    
    点击可展开，内含一些配置调试选项  
    注意：对性能有很大影响，可按`shift`+`F3`隐藏（会重新加载页面生效）

  spark is a performance profiler for Minecraft clients, servers and proxies.
</h3>

#### Useful Links
* [**Website**](https://spark.lucko.me/) - browse the project homepage
* [**Documentation**](https://spark.lucko.me/docs) - read documentation and usage guides
* [**Downloads**](https://spark.lucko.me/download) - latest plugin/mod downloads


## What does spark do?

spark is made up of three separate components:

* **CPU Profiler**: Diagnose performance issues.
* **Memory Inspection**: Diagnose memory issues.
* **Server Health Reporting**: Keep track of overall server health.

### :zap: CPU Profiler

spark's profiler can be used to diagnose performance issues: ""lag"", low tick rate, high CPU usage, etc.

It is:

* **Lightweight** - can be ran in production with minimal impact.
* **Easy to use** - no configuration or setup necessary, just install the plugin/mod.
* **Quick to produce results** - running for just ~30 seconds is enough to produce useful insights into problematic areas for performance.
* **Customisable** - can be tuned to target specific threads, sample at a specific interval, record only ""laggy"" periods, etc
* **Highly readable** - simple tree structure lends itself to easy analysis and interpretation. The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.

It works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.

There are two different profiler engines:
* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)
* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.

### :zap: Memory Inspection

spark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.

* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory
  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class
  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see next item)
* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory
  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.
  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.
* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server
  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.
  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use

### :zap: Server Health Reporting

spark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.

These metrics include:

* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command
* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)
* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the process, and by the overall system
* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process
* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system

As well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.

For a comparison between spark, WarmRoast, Minecraft timings and other profiles, see this [page](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/misc/spark-vs-others) in the spark docs.

399,QuiltMC/quilt-mappings,Java,"# Quilt Mappings

Quilt Mappings is a set of open, unencumbered Minecraft mappings, free for everyone to use under the Creative Commons Zero license. The intention is to let 
everyone mod Minecraft freely and openly, while also being able to innovate and process the mappings as they see fit.

To see the current version being targeted, check the branch name!

## Usage
To use Quilt Mappings-deobfuscated Minecraft for Minecraft modding or as a dependency in a Java project, you can use [quilt-gradle](https://github.com/quiltmc/quilt-gradle) Gradle plugin. See [fabric wiki tutorial](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) for more information.

To obtain a deobfuscated Minecraft jar, [`./gradlew mapNamedJar`](#mapNamedJar) will generate a jar named like `<minecraft version>-named.jar`, which can be sent to a decompiler for deobfuscated code.

Please note to run the Quilt Mappings build script **Java 17** or higher is required!

## Contributing

Our goal is to provide high-quality names that make intuitive sense. In our experience, this goal is best achieved through contribution of original names, rather than copying names from other mappings projects. While we believe that discussions relating to the names used by other mappings projects can be useful, those names must stand up to scrutiny on their own - we won't accept names on the grounds that they're present in other mappings projects. 

We recommend discussing your contribution with other members of the community - either directly in your pull request, or in our other community spaces. We're always happy to help if you need us!

Please have a look at the [naming conventions](/CONVENTIONS.md) before submitting mappings.

### Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run `./gradlew mappings` (Linux, macOS) or `gradlew mappings` (Windows) to open [Enigma](https://github.com/QuiltMC/Enigma), a user interface to easily edit the mappings
3. Commit and push your work to your fork
4. Open a pull request with your changes

## Gradle
Quilt Mappings uses Gradle to provide a number of utility tasks for working with the mappings.

### `mappings`
Setup and download and launch the latest version of [Enigma](https://github.com/QuiltMC/Enigma) automatically configured to use the merged jar and the mappings.

Compared to launching Enigma externally, the gradle task adds a name guesser plugin that automatically maps enums and a few constant field names.

### `mappingsUnpicked`
Same as above, but unpicks the constants and launches Enigma with them. Can be a little bit slower to get going.


### `build`
Build a GZip'd archive containing a tiny mapping between official (obfuscated), [hashed-mojmap](https://github.com/QuiltMC/mappings-hasher), and Quilt Mappings names (""named"") and packages enigma mappings into a zip archive.

### `mapNamedJar`
Builds a deobfuscated jar with Quilt mappings and automapped fields (enums, etc.). Unmapped names will be filled with [hashed-mojmap](https://github.com/QuiltMC/mappings-hasher) names.

### `decompileCFR`
Decompile the mapped source code. **Note:** This is not designed to be recompiled.

### `downloadMinecraftJars`
Downloads the client and server Minecraft jars for the current Minecraft version to `.gradle/minecraft`

### `mergeJars`

Merges the client and server jars into one merged jar, located at `VERSION-merged.jar` in the project directory
where `VERSION` is the current Minecraft version.

400,mcxr-org/MCXR,Java,"# ⚠️ MCXR Development has been paused until further notice ⚠️
The details behind this are messy but MCXR Desktop will not recive any updates or fixes for the forseeable future. 

Until then I recommend using the [Vivecraft Port](https://github.com/ferriarnus/VivecraftMod) which has Quilt, Forge and Fabric support.

403,DarkStorm652/DarkBot,Java,"# DarkBot

  This project is an attempt at a better rewrite of the Minecraft client for use in automating Minecraft that I started around early July of last year. This isn't limited to simply botting; other uses include (completely) custom clients, server monitors, and more. Multi-protocol support was recently added, allowing the same version of the bot to run on different Minecraft versions (assuming that the corresponding protocol version provider is in the protocols/ directory).

[An example task that loads WorldEdit schematic files and constructs them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mahhJ6zK2BU) (written by someone else who has since lost the source)

## Getting Started

### With Eclipse
> Open Eclipse.  
> Right-click in the package explorer area and click Import...  
> Select Git > Projects from Git and click Next.  
> Select URI and click Next.  
> Paste the Git URL for DarkBot ([https://github.com/DarkStorm652/DarkBot.git](https://github.com/DarkStorm652/DarkBot.git)) and click Next, then click Next again at the Branch Selection dialog.  
> Change the directory to [your eclipse workspace]/DarkBot (change the [] to the actual path to your workspace by clicking browse) and click Next.  
> Select Use the New Project wizard and click Finish.  
> In the New Project wizard, select Java Project and click Next.  
> Type in DarkBot (exact capitalization). If you typed it in properly and all previous steps have been followed, options in the wizard should disable themselves. Click Finish if this is the case.  
> Once cloned, expand the project in your package explorer.  
> At this point you should see ""src/main/java"" and ""src/main/protocols"". If you see an empty src folder and no errors, you've missed the earlier step about changing the directory of the git clone.  
> If ""src/main/resources"" is not a source folder (you do not see it below the above two), then expand ""src"" (located below the libraries), expand ""main"", and right-click ""resources"" and click Build Path > Use as Source Folder.  
> Ensure that Eclipse automatically added all of the jars in ""lib"" to ""Referenced Libraries"". All errors should be resolved at this point.  
> Right-click build.xml and click Run As > Ant Build (the first option).  
> Wait for the build to complete and run DarkBot.jar from cmd with --help for args.  
> Hurray! The plus side to this method (though it may seem lengthier than the one below) is that you can right-click the project folder and click Team > Pull to get new updates. Make sure you run build.xml after every time you update.

Video2: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMPuucdEaOM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMPuucdEaOM)


### Without Eclipse
> Clone the project with git or download the source zip from the github page and extract it.  
> Open the folder and run build.xml (this may require cmd to execute).  
> Wait for the build to complete and run DarkBot.jar from cmd with --help for args.  
> Hurray! The downside to this is that you have to delete the folder and redo these steps every time you want to update.  

Video: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cACg\_XJsA8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cACg_XJsA8)


### To Run

Open Terminal or Command Prompt  
Switch to the directory with DarkBot.jar (`cd path/to/DarkBot` with Terminal or `cd C:\path\to\DarkBot` with Command Prompt)

For CLI Bot:
> Print arguments with `java -jar DarkBot.jar -t bot --help`  
> Use `java -jar DarkBot.jar -t bot <args>` where `<args>` consists of arguments from the list printed before (such as --username <username> or --server <server:port>)
   * If arguments keep getting printed, you are missing required arguments or have the wrong format

For CLI Spambot:
> Print arguments with `java -jar DarkBot.jar -t spambot --help`  
> Use `java -jar DarkBot.jar -t spambot <args>` where `<args>` consists of arguments from the list printed before (such as --bot-amount <count> or --server <server:port>)
   * If arguments keep getting printed, you are missing required arguments or have the wrong format

For GUI (NOT RECOMMENDED, INCOMPLETE):
> Run `java -jar DarkBot.jar -t gui --force`

Stevenarella is designed to support multiple protocol versions, so that client
development is not in lock-step with the server version. The level of
support varies, but the goal is to support major versions from 1.7.10
up to the current latest major version. Occasionally, snapshots are also supported.

Forge servers are supported on 1.7.10 - 1.12.2 (FML) and 1.13.2 - 1.16.5 (FML2).

Support for older protocols will _not_ be dropped as newer protocols are added.

### Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history on the `master` branch.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style. Please install and run [cargo fmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) before merging any changes.

### Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be
subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe
you have something valuable to add or change.

# Note

When I made this, I was highly inexperienced at programming (Less than 2 years), and the code is mostly pretty messy and game crashes a lot. 

I have kept it on my GitHub for historical reasons, seeing as I have videos about this on my YouTube channel.


## Versions (As seen in the YouTube videos)

This game has gone through major rewrites and refactors overtime.

To see the source code as it was in episodes 1, 2 and 3 of ""Creating Minecraft in C++/ OpenGL"" videos, look at an older commit here:

https://github.com/Hopson97/HopsonCraft/tree/90a5d596d07dfe71b5dbf47ec76c0b0802ec9dfa


## Dependencies
The project requires these libraries: SFML (minimum 2.4), GLEW 2.0+ (OpenGL 3.3+), and OpenGL Maths Library (GLM).

Compile using compiler flags:

Windows -> ``-std=c++14 -O3 -s -lglew32s -lglu32 -lopengl32 -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-audio -lsfml-system -lsfml-window``

Linux -> ``-std=c++14 -O3 -s -lGLEW -lGLU -lGL -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-audio -lsfml-system -lsfml-window``

----Overview----

This is my 8-bit AVR Minecraft Server... and some extra goodies.  This package
includes:

  * 754lib - A toolset for IEEE754-1985 doubles and floats to fixed point
  * os_generic - My toolset threads (unused), mutices (unused), and timing
  * util10 - My integer->string toolset for this project.
  * dumbcraft (.c, .h)
  * an x86 demo for dumbcraft (compiles and runs on Linux)
  * an AVR-buildable copy (see below)
  * a tool for generating gzipped map chunks (requires Linux)

The AVR folder contains:

  * avr_print - SPI debugging toolset (for use with tinyisp and tinyispterm)
  * my bitbanged ethernet (MAC + ARP + ICMP + UDP + TCP) driver (see below)
  * a really dumb HTTP server
  * a driver for SD cards (and a FAT32 driver) NO SUPPORT FOR FAT16!

Oh yeah, with debugging on, this all fits in about 17kB.

Depending on your settings (dumbcraft circular buffer, etc.) you can use
from about 600 bytes of static RAM to about 1.5 comfortably.

Sadly this does not include the stack, so if you can push data to the
clients and forget about it, that's probably for the best.


----What the dumbcraft does (and doesn't do)----

Dumbcraft is split into a C file for the core, and a user C file that contains
various action-related functions that you must support, i.e.:
  * void InitDumbgame()
  * void DoCustomPreloadStep( uint8_t playerid )
  * void PlayerTickUpdate( int playerid )
  * void PlayerClick( uint8_t playerid, uint8_t x, uint8_t y, uint8_t z )
  * void PlayerUpdate( uint8_t playerid )
  * uint8_t ClientHandleChat( char * chat, uint8_t chatlen )

The .C file contains the core dumbcraft toolset.  Because it doesn't support
any mode of communications with the outside world, all communications must be
done through various functions.  These functions interface 

What works:
  * The stock Minecraft 1.4.2 Server on Windows or Linux (most of the time)
  * More than one player
  * Running around
  * Pulling Levers
  * Updating blocks
  * Loading main map chunk
  * Chat

What doesn't work:
  * Day/night
  * MOBs
  * Physics
  * Animations
  * Crafting
  * Falling Blocks
  * Mining
  * Placing Blocks
  * Collecting things
  * The Nether
  * The End
  * Redstone
  * Water
  * Lava
  * Well, just about everything.

Take a look through dumbcraft.c to get a better hint as to how this all goes together.

----Mapmake----

Map make creates a chunk to be sent by 0x33.  This code doesn't seem to work
very well... It seems to work well enough to make big plot of green ground.

Try dinking with this to figure out why some other chunk types don't work?

It's used to generate the 'mapdata' buffer used in dumbcraft.c


----My IP Stack----

I wrote my own TCP/IP stack for this project, I've been working with it for
quite some time and I needed a good test.  Minecraft has shown to be an
excellent test.  It uses an ENC424j600 from Microchip in SPI mode. It doesn't
use the SPI hardware on an AVR, instead it bit bangs all communications with
it.  This is to make it possible to put it on any geographically convenient
pins.  (I do this on one-layer)

The stack contains the main MAC code and a file for the low level SPI
functionality.  Since the SPI has to be really fast, I've opted to write it
in assembly.

If you want to use the TCP/IP stack, you can feel free to copy it all out,
including test.c and rip out my code.  You'll need the basic callbacks from
TCP or UDP, but other than that you're good to go.

Reconfigure eth_config.h to your situation and profit.  You can get a UDP
server in a little under 4kB, and TCP for an extra ~2.5k more.

I included an HTTP server with it, but it barely counts as an HTTP server
since it requires additional code to serve ... anything.  You can see that it
is difficult to get it to server webpages from the SD card :-/.


----My FAT32/SD SPI Stack----

This stack is still pretty buggy but lets you read files from a FAT32
partition on a SD card.  It can either bin the root or in the FIRST partition.

It can list files in a folder, seek to folders, open files and read them 
sequentially... that's... about... it. 

The SD driver supports SDHC and SD cards and supports reading/writing at the
block level.  Keep in mind the FAT32 driver does not support writing.

Consider the test.c in the avr folder an example of how to do this.

----Building----

You'll need at the minimum: avrdude, avr-gcc and basic build-utils. I
recommend you get my copy of tinyispterm since that'll help you debug.

It prints debugging data through the SPI port if -DMUTE_PRINTF isn't set.
Everything's geared around a TinyISP from LadyAda... I personally use a tiny
variant of it I designed.  You can get the single-layer designs and the tool
here:

https://github.com/cnlohr/tinyispterm

The hardware details for this project can be found in the avr_hardware folder.

I am not a trained electrical engineer.  You will have to know your stuff
before venturing on this project!  It is tricky, and I didn't really document
anything very well.

I designed the PCB in ExpressPCB and designed the schematic later.  They don't
match and I got frustrated, so trust the PCB over the SCH.

Yes, it's a single layer.  No, there are no jumpers.

## Introduction

MCSManager Panel（abbr: MCSM Panel）is a multilingual, lightweight, out-of-the-box, and multi-instance Minecraft server control panel with Docker support.

MCSManager panel can help you manage multiple physical servers in one place, and create game servers at any host dynamically. It also provides a secure and reliable user permission system for a seamless multi-user experience.

<br />

## Runtime Environment

MCSManager panel can run on both Windows and Linux platforms without a database or complicated system configuration. As a lightweight control panel, you only need Node.js to run it. 

Required Node.js version: **14.17.6** or above.

<br />

## Install

### Windows

For the Windows systems, the MCSM panel has been **compiled into a click-to-run version**. 

Download it from the official site: [https://mcsmanager.com/](https://mcsmanager.com/)

<br />

### Linux

**Quick Install with one command**

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcsmanager/Script/master/setup_en.sh | bash
```

- The script is designed for Ubuntu/Centos/Debian/Archlinux of AMD64 architecture only.
- Use `systemctl start mcsm-{web,daemon}` to start service after installtion.
- Directory for panel components and runtime: `/opt/mcsmanager/`

<br />

**Linux Manual Installation**

- If the installation script does not work, you can try the following steps to install manually.

```bash
# switch to the installation directory. Please create it in advance with 'mkdir /opt/' if not exist.
cd /opt/
# Download runtime environment (Node.js). Ignore this step if you have Node.js 14+ installed already.
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.17.6/node-v14.17.6-linux-x64.tar.gz
# Decompress archive
tar -zxvf node-v14.17.6-linux-x64.tar.gz
# Add program to system PATH
ln -s /opt/node-v14.17.6-linux-x64/bin/node /usr/bin/node
ln -s /opt/node-v14.17.6-linux-x64/bin/npm /usr/bin/npm

# Prepare installation directory
mkdir /opt/mcsmanager/
cd /opt/mcsmanager/

# Download the web project
git clone https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager-Web-Production.git
# Rename and enter the directory
mv MCSManager-Web-Production web
cd web
# Install dependencies
npm install --production
cd /opt/mcsmanager/

# Download the Daemon
git clone https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager-Daemon-Production.git
# Rename and enter the directory
mv MCSManager-Daemon-Production daemon
cd daemon
# Install dependencies
npm install --production

# Please open two terminals or Screen
# Start the daemon first
cd /opt/mcsmanager/daemon
# Start the daemon
node app.js

# Start the web project (in the second terminal/screen)
cd /opt/mcsmanager/web
# start the application
node app.js

# Access http://localhost:23333/ for web interface
# In general, the web application will scan and connect to the local daemon automatically.
```

- Note, the above steps do not register the panel components to system service. You have to use 'screen' to manage it or register the system service manually.

<br />


## Data Directories

Web Config & Data: `/opt/mcsmanager/web/data/`

Daemon Config & Data `/opt/mcsmanager/daemon/data/`

<br />


## Update

Reference: https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager/wiki/Update-MCSManager

> Note, backup of `data` directory before each update is highly recommended.

<br />

## Projects

This software requires all three projects to run. The code you use for installation is the result of compilation and integration.

[**Web Backend**](https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager)

- Role: Control Center
- Responsible for: Backend APIs, user data management, and communication & authentication with daemons.

[**Frontend/UI**](https://github.com/MCSManager/UI)

- Role: The user interfaces for the backend.
- Responsible for: Displaying statistics via the web interface, sending requests, and communicating with daemons. The final product of this project is pure static files. 

[**Daemon**](https://github.com/MCSManager/Daemon)

- Role: Slave/controlled remote node
- Responsible for: Controlling all instances on localhost and managing the actual instance process. It is capable to communicate with all objects.

<br />

## Build the Development Environment

This is intended for developers. If you are not a developer, you can safely ignore these.

You can continue to develop or preview all the projects once they are running under the development environment. Please make sure to be in compliance with the license. 

**Web Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager.git
cd MCSManager
npm install
npm run start
# By default, use ts-node to run Typescript code directly
# By default, run on port 23333.

```

**UI Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MCSManager/UI.git
cd UI
npm install
npm run serve
# Preview the interface at http://localhost:8080/
# All the requests will be redirected to port 23333.
```

**Daemon Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MCSManager/Daemon.git
cd Daemon
npm install
npm run start
# After running, please connect the daemon to the control panel via the web interface.
# By default, run on port 24444
```

<br />

## Browser Compatibility

- Support mainstream modern browsers like `Chrome` `Firefox` `Safari` `Opera`.
- `IE` support has been dropped.

<br />

## i18n

The MCSManager internationlization was done by [Lazy](https://github.com/LazyCreeper), [KevinLu2000](https://github.com/KevinLu2000), [zijiren233](https://github.com/zijiren233) and [Unitwk](https://github.com/unitwk).

<br />

## Panel Permission

The control panel will check the user list while running. If there is no user available, a default administrator user will be created. 

If you forget your only administrator account, you can back up all the current user data, regenerate a new admin account, and overwrite the previous one. 

> User Data: /opt/mcsmanager/web/data/Users/*.json

<br />

Welcome to coolAlias' Minecraft Forge Modding Tutorials!

I've tried to add tutorials for subjects that I either haven't seen elsewhere, needed updating or just needed
further explanation.

Most of my tutorials are NOT set up like full proper code and WILL give you lots of errors if you just
copy and paste it into Eclipse.

That being said, all of the code I provide I have personally used and tested, so if you read all the comments,
follow the directions and do your best to understand what the code is doing, I'm confident you, too, will be
able to get it working.

I'm by no means, however, an expert in Java, so if you are and spot errors in my code or just have a better way
of doing it, then please let me know!

If you have any suggestions on how to make the tutorials more clear, if you have a question or if you just want to
say hi, leave a comment or p.m. me on minecraftforum.net and I'll see what I can do :)

Letting others join your server
-----------------
### LAN players
You need to find out your LAN/local IP address.
*  Windows: Type ```ipconfig``` into **Command Prompt**. Look for ```IPv4 address``` in the output
*  macOS: Type ```ipconfig getifaddr en0``` or ```ipconfig getifaddr en1``` into **Terminal**
*  Linux: Type ```hostname -I``` into **Terminal**. Lan IP is usually the first address in the output

#### Joining from a web browser
Enter the server URL followed by ```?ip=[lan ip]``` into the web browser.<br>
(e.g. http://www.classicube.net/server/play/d1362e7fee1a54365514712d007c8799?ip=192.168.1.30)

#### Joining from the ClassiCube client
* Click **Direct connect** at the main menu
* Type your username into *Username* textbox
* Type ```[lan ip]:25565``` into *IP:Port* textbox (e.g. ```192.168.1.30:25565```)
* Click **Connect**

### Across the internet
You usually need to port forward in your router before other players can join.

#### Joining from a web browser
Enter the server URL into the web browser

#### Joining from the ClassiCube client
* Click **Sign in**
* Type/paste the hash (e.g. ```d1362e7fee1a54365514712d007c8799```) into the *classicube.net/server/play* text box
* Click **Connect**


### Show on classicube.net server list
Click **Settings** in the MCGalaxy window, then tick the **Public** checkbox. Then click **Save**.

This makes your server appear in the server list on classicube.net and in the ClassiCube client.

This mod combines your Discord with your Minecraft server.

This is a server-side mod and therefore don't need to be on the client.

#### Changes compared to previous versions
- Support for multiple Discord channels
- Ability to configure per Discord channel and per Minecraft dimension
- All commands is executed through a FakeUser ([DiscordFakeUser / 828653ca-0185-43d4-b26d-620a7f016be6](https://mcuuid.net/?q=828653ca-0185-43d4-b26d-620a7f016be6)) that you can decide permissions to through vanilla OP and other permission mods.


Guide on how to get the information needed from Discord can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/Chikachi/ChikachiDiscord/wiki/How-to-get-a-token-and-channel-ID-for-Discord).

_This mod is not affiliated with Discord in any way._

415,bambosan/Nori-Shaders-BE,GLSL,
416,nguyer/bedrock-server,Dockerfile,"# minecraft-bedrock
Run a bedrock server in a Docker container

This Dockerfile will download the Bedrock Server app and set it up, along with its dependencies.

If you run the container as is, the `worlds` directory will be created inside the container, which is unadvisable. It is highly recommended that you store your worlds outside the container using a mount. It is also likely that you will want to customize your `server.properties` file. The best way to do this is also using a `server.properties` file outside the container using a mount.

Here is a `docker run` command that will do that, assuming you have a `worlds` directory and `server.properties` file at `/minecraft`. (You should change the path to wherever your stuff is.)

    $ sudo docker run -d --name=minecraft\
        -v '/minecraft/worlds:/bedrock-server/worlds'\
        -v '/minecraft/server.properties:/bedrock-server/server.properties'\
        --network host\
        --restart=always\
        nguyer/bedrock-server

If you wanted to use custom resource packs, a whitelist, or other things, you could also mount those paths as well. Separating the content from the sever executable means that you can safely destroy your Docker container without losing your world. This will come in handy when there are updates to the server app, and you want to redeploy the container.

Hopefully this is helpful to folks. Happy Minecrafting!

### About

The goal of this project is to provide tools for mod developers so they no longer have to worry about performance, or
limitations of Minecraft's archaic rendering engine. That said, this is primarily an outlet for me to have fun with
graphics programming.

### Instancing

Flywheel provides an alternate, unified path for entity and tile entity rendering that takes advantage of GPU
instancing. In doing so, Flywheel gives the developer the flexibility to define their own vertex and instance formats,
and write custom shaders to ingest that data.

### Shaders

To accomodate the developer and leave more in the hands of the engine, Flywheel provides a custom shader loading and
templating system to hide the details of the CPU/GPU interface. This system is a work in progress. There will be
breaking changes, and I make no guarantees of backwards compatibility.

### Plans

- Vanilla performance improvements
- Compute shader particles
- Deferred rendering
- Different renderers for differently aged hardware

### Getting Started (For Developers)

Add the following repo and dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name ""tterrag maven""
        url ""https://maven.tterrag.com/""
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation fg.deobf(""com.jozufozu.flywheel:Flywheel-Forge:${flywheel_version}"")
}
```
`${flywheel_version}` gets replaced by the version of Flywheel you want to use, eg. `1.18-0.3.0.3`

For a list of available Flywheel versions, you can check [the maven](https://maven.tterrag.com/com/jozufozu/flywheel/Flywheel-Forge/).

If you aren't using mixed mappings (or just want to be safe), add the following properties to your run configurations:
```groovy
property 'mixin.env.remapRefMap', 'true'
property 'mixin.env.refMapRemappingFile', ""${projectDir}/build/createSrgToMcp/output.srg""
```
This ensures that Flywheel's mixins get properly loaded in your dev env.

## Bug Reports [![bug]][bug-link]

Please report any and all bugs you might encounter while playing with this mod (this only applies to versions of Minecraft this mod is currently being developed for). Suggestions are also welcome.
However before reporting a bug please update to the latest version of the mod to see if it still persists.
If you want to post bug reports for older versions, make sure to tell me what version you are using and the version of Forge you are using.
If you report a bug and I request more feedback, the label 'Awaiting reply' will be added, if I have had no response for 5 days after adding that label, the issue will be closed.

## Technical Documentation [![wiki]][wiki-link]

AgriCraft is documented in the official GitHub wiki. Note that
this kind of information is, most of the time, only needed by pack creators and not the average user.

## Compilation Notes

The latest versions of ForgeGradle require some tweaking to get builds working. The two most important things to note are as follows:

1. ForgeGradle does not like JDKs newer than JDK8. To develop install [openjdk8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot), and update `gradle.propeties` to contain the following:
```
org.gradle.java.home = C:\\Program Files\\AdoptOpenJDK\\jdk-8.0.275.1-hotspot
```

2. The default JVM heap size is too small to handle decompilation of MineCraft. Builds fail without increasing the heap size that Gradle allocates for the build. Update `gradle.propeties` to contain the following:
```
# Sets default memory used for gradle commands. Can be overridden by user or command line properties.
# This is required to provide enough memory for the Minecraft decompilation process.
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx3G
```

> Note: We do not provide a default `gradle.properties` file as it is discouraged by the Gradle documentation, given that the file may contain maven login information and the likes.

### 请支持正版！

www.Minecraft.net

一次购买终身享受 请务必支持正版!!!

通过替换DLL实现绕过参见： https://github.com/xingchuanzhen/Minecraft-Unlock

通过禁用服务实现绕过参见：https://github.com/xingchuanzhen/Minecraft_Bypass_the_program

通过修改内存实现绕过参见：https://github.com/xingchuanzhen/Minecraft_Memory_Bypass

### 介绍


傻瓜式一键操作，全自动化执行程序

自动起调MinecraftUWP，自动结束RuntimeBroker.exe

游戏30分钟左右不会出现“解锁完整游戏”

游戏关闭后自动还原注册表，启动服务项

项目开源免费完全公开，火绒、360、管家无报毒


### 使用方法:

 1.双击打开软件

 2.单击“启动程序”按钮
 
 3.等待提示“启动完成”即可开始游戏

 注：程序之所以要申请管理员权限，是为了修改部分注册表，在关闭程序后会自动还原修改后的注册表
 
 ### 命令行调用格式
 
         [Implement   |   Reduction]   <Notify_NO>  <Interface_NO>

         命令解释：

         [必须]
         Implement		启动并执行程序
         Reduction		启动并执行还原

         <可选>
         Notify_NO		隐藏任务栏通知

         <可选>
         Interface_NO       隐藏图形化界面
         
         示例：
         
         Reduction   Interface_NO 

注意：Releases版本并不支持命令行调用，请克隆源码后自行编译使用

### 软件执行流程(单击“启动程序后”)：

 1.开始释放内嵌入注册表文件到用户临时文件夹

 2.执行导入注册表操作

 3.使用NET命令停止系统ClipSVC 服务

 4.删除释放过程中的注册表文件

 5.通过Process的Start方法调起 MinecraftUWP

 6.后台等待30秒后开始使用Tasklist命令显示Microsoft Store 应用及其关联的进程

 7.开始扫描MinecraftUWP关联的RuntimeBroker进程PID

 8.获取到PID后使用Tasklist命令强制结束进程，此时游戏启动完毕

 9.启动后台每隔1秒自动扫描与Minecraft相关联的RuntimeBroker进程并结束

 10.同时检测Minecraf进程是否退出，绕过退出程序自动关闭，同时还原注册表和服务项


### 注意事项：

 1.游戏运行时不能关闭本程序，关闭游戏后程序会自动退出
  
 2.需要提前下载MinecraftUWP否则会提示没有安装MinecraftUWP
  
 3.启动成功后软件会自动隐藏到托盘，如果结束程序后则将在30分钟内游戏自动失效

 4.本程序仅供学习交流，严禁商用或其他方法用途，严禁非法第三方倒卖，软件永久开源免费

 5.不要在任务栏中，或任务管理器中直接结束本进程，进程检测到退出游戏后10秒内自动退出并还原注册表和服务项，退出完成后会有提示

 6.正常使用情况下不会造成系统故障，如果遇到商店无法下载应用的情况下，或者无法安装UWP应用时，可用尝试打开程序，直接点击“关闭程序”按钮，程序会重新还原系统修改项

427,Rilshrink/Minecraft-Disablers,Java,"# Minecraft-Disablers
A list of known Minecraft Anticheat Disablers, this is mostly so the Dev's of the Anticheats know how to patch them.

All of these disablers are patched and no longer work, and since I have no intention of updating these, I will be archiving the repo.
But will provide a short explanation on why I believe these worked.

Current Disablers: <br>
Kauri, worked because the anticheat required the client to sync at least one transaction packet, but by not sending one the anticheat would just disable all checks until it did. <br>
OnlyMC, worked because delaying transactions disabled a majority of the checks, and then the flight and speed checks were fully disabled by forcing a flag every 50 ticks, sending the C0CPacketInput also disabled some speed checks.  <br>
LunarGG, worked the same as OnlyMC disabler, but with a client spoofer built in and different delays. <br>
HazelMC, worked by delaying keep alives and transactions caused the anticheat to 'loosen' up on it's checks, sending an invalid keep alive packet every tick also disabled most of the checks, most likely the ping spoof checks as well.<br>
Mineplex Combat, since the combat checks relied on the keep alive packets, not sending them wasn't an option, but sending invalid ones was, and caused the server to disable auto-bans, but it still flagged,<br>
Verus Combat, worked by disabling the syncing of your sprint state to the server and by canceling transactions. You had to send at least one transaction packet otherwise it would just flag you for ping spoofing. This disabled a majority but not all of the combat checks. <br>
ACMC Disabler, worked by slowing down the game timer to not trigger any timer checks, force flagging every 15 ticks to disable flight checks, and delaying transactions and keepalives disabled a lot of checks on it's own, mostly the combat and movement checks.<br>
Cold Network, worked the same as the other Verus disablers, except they used a newer version where it was patched and would ban after 10 minutes of play, flagged ping spoof every 2-3 minutes. <br>
EarthPolMC disabler, worked by making matrix anticheat think you were connecting to the server through geyser by sending a a custom payload through their plugin channel, this was patched soon after it was discovered by making it only accept the custom payloads from the server or proxy.
<br>
Disabler.js was for Liquidbounce

# Phosphor (for Fabric)
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric.svg)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric.svg)
![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric.svg)

Phosphor is a free and open-source Minecraft mod (under GNU GPLv3) aiming to save your CPU cycles and improve performance by optimizing one of Minecraft's most inefficient areas-- the lighting engine.
It works on **both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod**.

The mod is designed to be as minimal as possible in the changes it makes, and as such, does not modify the light model or interfaces of vanilla Minecraft. Because of this, Phosphor should be compatible
with many Minecraft mods (so long as they do not make drastic changes to how the lighting engine works.) If you've ran into a compatibility problem, please open an issue!


---

## Installation

### Manual installation (recommended)

You will need Fabric Loader 0.10.x or newer installed in your game in order to load Phosphor. If you haven't installed
Fabric mods before, you can find a variety of community guides for doing so [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install).

#### Stable releases

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric.svg)

The latest releases of Phosphor are published to our [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and
[GitHub release](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/releases) pages. Releases are considered by our team to be
**suitable for general use**, but they are not guaranteed to be free of bugs and other issues.

Usually, releases will be made available on GitHub slightly sooner than other locations.

#### Bleeding-edge builds (unstable)

[![GitHub build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/gradle-ci/1.16.x/dev)](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

If you are a player who is looking to get your hands on the latest **bleeding-edge changes for testing**, consider
taking a look at the automated builds produced through our [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml?query=event%3Apush).
This workflow automatically runs every time a change is pushed to the repository, and as such, the builds it produces
will generally reflect the latest snapshot of development.

Bleeding edge builds will often include unfinished code that hasn't been extensively tested. That code may introduce
incomplete features, bugs, crashes, and all other kinds of weird issues. You **should not use these bleeding edge builds**
unless you know what you are doing and are comfortable with software debugging. If you report issues using these builds,
we will expect that this is the case. Caveat emptor.

### CurseForge

[![CurseForge downloads](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_372124_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/phosphor)

If you are using the CurseForge client, you can continue to find downloads through our
[CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/phosphor). Unless you are using the CurseForge
client, you should prefer the downloads linked on our Modrinth or GitHub release pages above.

---

### Reporting Issues

You can report bugs and crashes by opening an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/issues).
Before opening a new issue, use the search tool to make sure that your issue has not already been reported and ensure
that you have completely filled out the issue template. Issues which are duplicates or do not contain the necessary
information to triage and debug may be closed.

Please note that while the issue tracker is open to feature requests, development is primarily focused on
improving hardware compatibility, performance, and finishing any unimplemented features necessary for parity with
the vanilla renderer.

### Community
[![Discord chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat%20on-discord-7289DA?logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://caffeinemc.net/discord)

We have an [official Discord community](https://caffeinemc.net/discord) for all of our projects. By joining, you can:
- Get installation help and technical support with all of our mods
- Be notified of the latest developments as they happen
- Get involved and collaborate with the rest of our team
- ... and just hang out with the rest of our community.

---

### Building from sources

Support is not provided for setting up build environments or compiling the mod. We ask that
users who are looking to get their hands dirty with the code have a basic understanding of compiling Java/Gradle
projects. The basic overview is provided here for those familiar.

#### Requirements

- JDK 8 or newer
  - You will need JDK 8 in order to build Phosphor, which can be installed through a supported package manager such as
    [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows or [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) on other platforms. If you'd prefer to
    not use a package manager, you can always grab the installers or packages directly from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
- Gradle 6.7 or newer (optional)
  - The [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:using_wrapper) is provided in
    this repository can be used instead of installing a suitable version of Gradle yourself. However, if you are building
    many projects, you may prefer to install it yourself through a suitable package manager as to save disk space and to
    avoid many different Gradle daemons sitting around in memory.

#### Building with Gradle

Phosphor uses a typical Gradle project structure and can be built by simply running the default `build` task. After Gradle
finishes building the project, you can find the build artifacts (typical mod binaries, and their sources) in
`build/libs`.

**Tip:** If this is a one-off build, and you would prefer the Gradle daemon does not stick around in memory afterwards,
try adding the [`--no-daemon` flag](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon)
to ensure that the daemon is torn down after the build is complete. However, subsequent builds of the project will
[start more slowly](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:why_the_daemon) if the Gradle
daemon is not available to be re-used.


Build artifacts ending in `dev` are outputs containing the sources and compiled classes
before they are remapped into stable intermediary names. If you are working in a developer environment and would
like to add the mod to your game, you should prefer to use the `modRuntime` or `modImplementation` configurations provided by
Loom instead of these outputs.

432,svenhjol/Charm,Java,"# Charm for Minecraft 1.18.2

## Version 4.x
Charm is a vanilla-plus mod for Minecraft, inspired by the Quark mod.

It requires Fabric API, Minecraft 1.18.2 and Java 17.

If you would like to participate in testing pre-release versions of Charm, please get in touch on [Discord](https://discord.gg/S649dvZ9Ma) (working invite link as of august 2022!)

### Why has my issue been closed?
Sadly, we don't have the time to support versions earlier than **1.18.2**.  There's barely any time for supporting the latest version!

If we thought your issue related to an earlier version then we closed it to try and decrease the amount of issue noise.

We welcome any developer support to maintain older versions. Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/S649dvZ9Ma).

Please note that creating any new issues about earlier versions will also be closed.

### Mixins and accessors
* All accessor mixins have been removed.  Accesswideners are now used instead.

* Mixins use `inject`s as often as possible to avoid conflicts.
* To blacklist any mixin, create a file in the config called `charm-mixin-blacklist.txt` and add each mixin to disable on its own line in the following format: `module_name.MixinClassName`
  * example: `no_treasure_enchantment_trading.CheckIfTradeableMixin`
* The `helper.LoadCustomModelPartsMixin` cannot be blacklisted as Charm requires it to render custom models and will otherwise cause a client-side crash.
* `helper`, `core` and `event` mixins can be blacklisted but this is not recommended as doing so will cause inconsistent behavior in Charm.


### Support
**Charm 4.x for Minecraft 1.18 is now the main version of Charm.**

Charm for Minecraft 1.17 (and older versions) will no longer receive official support.

A Forge port of the latest version of Charm may be considered.

We had been stucked in the world of color for four years.  The wait is over. You can control over Minecraft Java Edition Version 1.16.5 in Scratch 3 or Python.

## Remote control over Minecraft in Python / Scratch

By using the Minecraft API and coding in Scratch or Python, you can place blocks and move Steve around, and more.

As you know, it is of course fun to do such things manually in the Minecraft world, but it is also fun to code and automatically remote control. And it's an excellent subject to get you interested in learning Scratch or Python.

In my class, we even include the use of git and GitHub.com, which is a fun self-study material for both young learners and experienced ones. **It's a great way to learn a programming language by having something you want to do first.**

I believe the same is true for learning a foreign language. **Don't learn the language, use the language.** (I've just created the 'quote' now. ;) )

## Editions / versions and environments
There are three different environments depending on the combination of Minecraft editions and versions.

Regarding Python modules, the Java version 1.12.2 uses the traditional mcpi as in the Raspi version, while the Java version 1.16.5 uses the new mcje.  The Java version 1.16.5 uses the new mcje. The RasPi version does not require any mods, while each of the two Java versions requires the same version of mods as Minecradt, and a Forge to house the mods.
|Minecraft|Forge|mod|Python module|Scratch + Extension|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Pi Edition (MCPI) Raspbery Pi|-|-|[mcpi](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi)|Scratch 1.4 + [Scratch2MCPI](https://github.com/scratch2mcpi/scratch2mcpi)|
|Java Edition (MCJE) 1.12.2|[Forge 1.12.2](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html)|[RemoteControllerMod-1.12.2 v0.02](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/remote-controller/files/3242375)|[mcpi](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi)|[Scratch 3 + MC Ext 1.12.2](https://takecx.github.io/scratch-gui/1-12-2/)|
|Java Edition (MCJE) 1.16.5|[Forge 1.16.5](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.5.html)|[RemoteControllerMod-1.16.5 v0.05](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/remote-controller/files/3363255)|[mcje](./mcje)|[Scratch 3 + MC Ext 1.16.5](https://takecx.github.io/scratch-gui/1-16-5/)|

***Optifine mod might fine tune on the visual effects of Minecraft Java Edition to make it snappier.You need to select the same version as Minecraft. https://optifine.net/downloads
You might need Java SE 8 JRE to run Forge. https://www.java.com/download/***

You can run Minecraft Java Edition on Linux including Raspberry Pi, Mac and PC. Unfortunately, at least so far, new comer who cannnot have Mojang account are very difficult to launch the Java Edition app on Raspberry Pi. (Minecraft account system is in the middle of migrating from Mojang account to Microsoft one. Arm platform is not on the support list of Microsoft.)

The changes of Minecraft Java Edition at 1.13 ""Update Aquatic"" were so significant that we were forced to stay with 1.12.2 for three long years in remote control over Minecraft. We broke thruough it by the huge effort of [takecx](https://github.com/takecx), then made it possible to work with version 1.16.5.

But, once again, the changes at version 1.17 was pretty large. For the compatibility with the latest version of Minecraft-Forge 1.17, please wait for a while to cope with it. Or, rather concider to join force with us for the development of [RemoteControllerMod](https://github.com/takecx/RemoteControllerMod) on GitHub.com to reduce the wait.

(The black horse is thinking... to help us?)

## Examples to draw something in the Minecraft world by voxels or volume pixels
Sorry, examples are only in Python, not for Scratch, so far. See [takecy's](https://github.com/takecx/RemoteControllerMod) to start in Scratch.
 - [hello_MCPI.py](./hello_MCPI.py), [hello_MCJE.py](./hello_MCJE.py), [hello_MCJE1122.py](./hello_MCJE1122.py) : Typical Hello World code. **Try this first to learn how to select Python module mcpi or mcje for your environment.** Install mcpi from Pypi with this. ``` pip3 install mcpi --user ``` or ``` pip install mcpi --user ```

 - [digitalclock.py](digitalclock.py) to display a realtime clock with time and date using 5 x 7, LCD font in the format as follows (also shown in the picture above):
```
        2021-06-26
         21:28:45
```
Using hand-made LCD font on double-buffer display, you can learn 'class'.  I prefer SEA_LANTERN_BLOCK for the time display but unfortunately it's not available in MCPI.

 - [axis_flat.py](axis_flat.py) : Module to draw x, y, and z-axis and to flatten the world in addition. Nice and useful utilities to prepare the world for learning.
  Axes with the virtual origin at (0, 80, 0) for MCJE, or (0, 20, 0) for MCPI using block types as follows:
    - x-axis: Stone blocks
    - y-axis: Grass on soil blocks
    - z-axis: Gold blocks

 - [demo1.py](./demo1.py), [demo2.py](./demo2.py) : Usage of axis_flat or double_buffer_display modules.
 - **(NEW)** [maze.py](./maze.py) : Building a maze in the Minecraft world by supu, Python VTuber. Watch her movie on YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK3V8q2EiI8
**""Remote Minecraft by Python""** — Let's create a maze automatically and play with it on Minecraft. — In Japanese without English CC, sorry.
   - Using a Python module named mazelib. It contains C++ code and there is no binary on Pypi, it needs to be built during installation with pip.
   - Mac, Linux：
       - You should be successfully install it with ```sudo pip3 install mazelib ```
   - Windows 10／11：
      - If you have C++ build tools, this will help you: ```pip install mazelib``` Or read the details below.

**You might think learning axes or axis are too difficult and too early for age 8, but it's not true. If you are thinking to *teach* them, it's true. Just try to assist kids learning. Umm, I'm just playing with them, actually.**

[<img src=""./images/maze_letters.png"" width=""220"">](./images/maze_letters.png) [<img src=""./images/maze_blocks.png"" width=""220"">](./images/maze_blocks.png)

(Maze by letters, and by blocks in the Minecraft world.)

### Widows C++ build tools (for mazelib)
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Open the ""Tools for Visual Studio 2022"" in the page, then get the ""Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022"". The app/tool is stand-alone so **you don't need the Visual Studio 2022 itself.**

Launch the app and you will know the name is Visual Studio Installer.
Click the ""Modify"" then, find and install two components below in the ""Individual components"" tab.

Paths
-----
Locations:

* `bin`   - Compiled binaries
* `share` - Distributed read-only data
* `user`  - User-created modifiable data

Where each location is on each platform:

* Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source:
    * `bin`   = `bin`
    * `share` = `.`
    * `user`  = `.`
* Windows installed:
    * `bin`   = `C:\Program Files\Minetest\bin (Depends on the install location)`
    * `share` = `C:\Program Files\Minetest (Depends on the install location)`
    * `user`  = `%APPDATA%\Minetest`
* Linux installed:
    * `bin`   = `/usr/bin`
    * `share` = `/usr/share/minetest`
    * `user`  = `~/.minetest`
* macOS:
    * `bin`   = `Contents/MacOS`
    * `share` = `Contents/Resources`
    * `user`  = `Contents/User OR ~/Library/Application Support/minetest`

Worlds can be found as separate folders in: `user/worlds/`

Configuration file
------------------
- Default location:
    `user/minetest.conf`
- This file is created by closing Minetest for the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
    `--config <path-to-file>`
- A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in
    `location_of_exe/../minetest.conf` and also `location_of_exe/../../minetest.conf`

Command-line options
--------------------
- Use `--help`

#### Download

You can install Git for easily keeping your copy up to date.
If you don’t want Git, read below on how to get the source without Git.
This is an example for installing Git on Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install git

For Fedora users:

    sudo dnf install git

Download source (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times) using Git:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest.git
    cd minetest

Download minetest_game (otherwise only the ""Development Test"" game is available) using Git:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game.git games/minetest_game

Download IrrlichtMt to `lib/irrlichtmt`, it will be used to satisfy the IrrlichtMt dependency that way:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht.git lib/irrlichtmt

Download source, without using Git:

    wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    cd minetest-master

Download minetest_game, without using Git:

    cd games/
    wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    mv minetest_game-master minetest_game
    cd ..

Download IrrlichtMt, without using Git:

    cd lib/
    wget https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    mv irrlicht-master irrlichtmt
    cd ..

#### Build

Build a version that runs directly from the source directory:

    cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=TRUE
    make -j$(nproc)

Run it:

    ./bin/minetest

- Use `cmake . -LH` to see all CMake options and their current state.
- If you want to install it system-wide (or are making a distribution package),
  you will want to use `-DRUN_IN_PLACE=FALSE`.
- You can build a bare server by specifying `-DBUILD_SERVER=TRUE`.
- You can disable the client build by specifying `-DBUILD_CLIENT=FALSE`.
- You can select between Release and Debug build by `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug or Release>`.
  - Debug build is slower, but gives much more useful output in a debugger.
- If you build a bare server you don't need to compile IrrlichtMt, just the headers suffice.
  - In that case use `-DIRRLICHT_INCLUDE_DIR=/some/where/irrlichtmt/include`.

- Minetest will use the IrrlichtMt package that is found first, given by the following order:
  1. Specified `IRRLICHTMT_BUILD_DIR` CMake variable
  2. `${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/irrlichtmt` (if existent)
  3. Installation of IrrlichtMt in the system-specific library paths
  4. For server builds with disabled `BUILD_CLIENT` variable, the headers from `IRRLICHT_INCLUDE_DIR` will be used.
  - NOTE: Changing the IrrlichtMt build directory (includes system installs) requires regenerating the CMake cache (`rm CMakeCache.txt`)

### CMake options

General options and their default values:

    BUILD_CLIENT=TRUE          - Build Minetest client

### Compiling on Windows using MSVC

### Requirements

- [Visual Studio 2015 or newer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Compiling and installing the dependencies

It is highly recommended to use vcpkg as package manager.

After you successfully built vcpkg you can easily install the required libraries:
```powershell
vcpkg install zlib zstd curl[winssl] openal-soft libvorbis libogg libjpeg-turbo sqlite3 freetype luajit gmp jsoncpp opengl-registry --triplet x64-windows
```

- **Don't forget about IrrlichtMt.** The easiest way is to clone it to `lib/irrlichtmt` as described in the Linux section.
- `curl` is optional, but required to read the serverlist, `curl[winssl]` is required to use the content store.
- `openal-soft`, `libvorbis` and `libogg` are optional, but required to use sound.
- `luajit` is optional, it replaces the integrated Lua interpreter with a faster just-in-time interpreter.
- `gmp` and `jsoncpp` are optional, otherwise the bundled versions will be compiled

There are other optional libraries, but they are not tested if they can build and link correctly.

Use `--triplet` to specify the target triplet, e.g. `x64-windows` or `x86-windows`.

### Compile Minetest

#### a) Using the vcpkg toolchain and CMake GUI
1. Start up the CMake GUI
2. Select **Browse Source...** and select DIR/minetest
3. Select **Browse Build...** and select DIR/minetest-build
4. Select **Configure**
5. Choose the right visual Studio version and target platform. It has to match the version of the installed dependencies
6. Choose **Specify toolchain file for cross-compiling**
7. Click **Next**
8. Select the vcpkg toolchain file e.g. `D:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
9. Click Finish
10. Wait until cmake have generated the cash file
11. If there are any errors, solve them and hit **Configure**
12. Click **Generate**
13. Click **Open Project**
14. Compile Minetest inside Visual studio.

#### b) Using the vcpkg toolchain and the commandline

Run the following script in PowerShell:

```powershell
cmake . -G""Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_GETTEXT=OFF -DENABLE_CURSES=OFF
cmake --build . --config Release
```
Make sure that the right compiler is selected and the path to the vcpkg toolchain is correct.

### Windows Installer using WiX Toolset

Requirements:
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/)

In the Visual Studio 2017 Installer select **Optional Features -> WiX Toolset**.

Build the binaries as described above, but make sure you unselect `RUN_IN_PLACE`.

Open the generated project file with Visual Studio. Right-click **Package** and choose **Generate**.
It may take some minutes to generate the installer.

### Compiling on MacOS

#### Requirements
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Install dependencies with homebrew:

```
brew install cmake freetype gettext gmp hiredis jpeg jsoncpp leveldb libogg libpng libvorbis luajit zstd
```

#### Download

Download source (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times) using Git:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest.git
cd minetest
```

Download minetest_game (otherwise only the ""Development Test"" game is available) using Git:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game.git games/minetest_game
```

Download Minetest's fork of Irrlicht:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht.git lib/irrlichtmt
```

#### Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14 \
    -DCMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK=LAST \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../build/macos/ \
    -DRUN_IN_PLACE=FALSE -DENABLE_GETTEXT=TRUE

make -j$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)
make install
```

#### Run

```
open ./build/macos/minetest.app
```

Docker
------
We provide Minetest server Docker images using the GitLab mirror registry.

Images are built on each commit and available using the following tag scheme:

* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:latest` (latest build)
* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<branch/tag>` (current branch or current tag)
* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<commit-id>` (current commit id)

If you want to test it on a Docker server you can easily run:

	sudo docker run registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<docker tag>

If you want to use it in a production environment you should use volumes bound to the Docker host
to persist data and modify the configuration:

	sudo docker create -v /home/minetest/data/:/var/lib/minetest/ -v /home/minetest/conf/:/etc/minetest/ registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:master

Data will be written to `/home/minetest/data` on the host, and configuration will be read from `/home/minetest/conf/minetest.conf`.

**Note:** If you don't understand the previous commands please read the official Docker documentation before use.

You can also host your Minetest server inside a Kubernetes cluster. See our example implementation in [`misc/kubernetes.yml`](misc/kubernetes.yml).


Version scheme
--------------
We use `major.minor.patch` since 5.0.0-dev. Prior to that we used `0.major.minor`.

- Major is incremented when the release contains breaking changes, all other
numbers are set to 0.
- Minor is incremented when the release contains new non-breaking features,
patch is set to 0.
- Patch is incremented when the release only contains bugfixes and very
minor/trivial features considered necessary.

Since 5.0.0-dev and 0.4.17-dev, the dev notation refers to the next release,
i.e.: 5.0.0-dev is the development version leading to 5.0.0.
Prior to that we used `previous_version-dev`.

442,BuiltBrokenModding/ICBM-2,Java,"## What is ICBM?

#### NOTE

**The current 1.7.10 versions are complete rewrites of ICBM, most things from 1.6.4 are not implemented yet. There are plans to implement missing content later, either in ICBM or in separate mods.**

ICBM is a Minecraft Mod that introduces intercontinental ballistic missiles to Minecraft.

## Who owns ICBM
Originally ICBM was owned mostly by Calclavia with the Sentry guns belonging to DarkGuardsman. After a few event and lack of progress ownership was shifted fully to DarkGuardsman. This was in exchange for majority ownership of Resonant Induction to Calclavia. 

That being said as far as DarkGuardsman is concerned the mod downloads are community property. At any time the mod is no longer supported or updated anyone is welcome to take over. Given that the new maintainer understands who owns the code at the end of the day.

Other advice
-----------------

Not all features are 'Essentials Ready'.  Essentials is designed to cover the basic needs of Minecraft server administration, thus, we reject over 80% of feature requests that we deem are unsuitable.

Before developing an Essentials feature, we would recommend speaking to a developer in the Essentials IRC channel ([#essentials on irc.esper.net](http://tiny.cc/EssentialsChat)). Click [here](irc://irc.esper.net/#essentials) if you have a IRC client.

MESECONS by Jeija and contributors

Mezzee-what?
------------
[Mesecons](https://mesecons.net/)! They're yellow, they're conductive, and they'll add a whole new dimension to Minetest's gameplay.

Mesecons is a mod for [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) that implements a ton of items related to digital circuitry, such as wires, buttons, lights, and even programmable controllers. Among other things, there are also pistons, solar panels, pressure plates, and note blocks.

Mesecons has a similar goal to Redstone in Minecraft, but works in its own way, with different rules and mechanics.

OK, I want in.
--------------
Go get it!

[DOWNLOAD IT NOW](https://github.com/minetest-mods/mesecons/archive/master.zip)

Now go ahead and install it like any other Minetest mod. Don't know how? Check out [the wonderful page about it](https://wiki.minetest.net/Mods) over at the official Minetest Wiki. For your convenience, here's a quick summary:

1. If Mesecons is still in a ZIP file, extract the folder inside to somewhere on the computer.
2. Make sure that when you open the folder, you can directly find `README.md` in the listing. If you just see another folder, move that folder up one level and delete the old one.
3. Open up the Minetest mods folder - usually `/mods/`. If you see the `minetest` or folder inside of that, that is your mod folder instead.
4. Copy the Mesecons folder into the mods folder.

Don't like some parts of Mesecons? Open up the Mesecons folder and delete the subfolder containing the mod you don't want. If you didn't want movestones, for example, all you have to do is delete the `mesecons_movestones` folder and they will no longer be available.

There are no dependencies - it will work right after installing!

How do I use this thing?
------------------------
How about a [quick overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kmeQj6iW5k)?

Or maybe a [comprehensive reference](http://mesecons.net/items.html) is your style?

An overview for the very newest of new beginners? How does [this one](http://uberi.mesecons.net/projects/MeseconsBasics/index.html) look?

There is also a [wiki page](https://wiki.minetest.net/Mods/Mesecons) dedicated to this mod.

Want to get more into building? Why not check out the [Mesecons Laboratory](http://uberi.mesecons.net/), a website dedicated to advanced Mesecons builders?

448,Cubitect/cubiomes,C,"# cubiomes

Cubiomes is a standalone library, written in C, that mimics the biome and feature generation of Minecraft Java Edition.
It is intended as a powerful tool to devise very fast, custom seed finding applications and large-scale map viewers with minimal memory usage.


#### Cubiomes-Viewer

If you want to get started without coding, there is now also a [graphical application](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer) based on this library.


#### Audience

You should be familiar with the C programming language. A basic understanding of the Minecraft biome generation process would also be helpful.


## Getting Started

This section is meant to give you a quick starting point with small example programs if you want to use this library to find your own biome dependent features.


### Biome Generator

Let's create a simple program called `find_biome_at.c` which tests seeds for a Mushroom Fields biome at a predefined location.

```C
// check the biome at a block position
#include ""generator.h""
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // Set up a biome generator that reflects the biome generation of
    // Minecraft 1.18.
    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, MC_1_18, 0);

    // Seeds are internally represented as unsigned 64-bit integers.
    uint64_t seed;
    for (seed = 0; ; seed++)
    {
        // Apply the seed to the generator for the Overworld dimension.
        applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

        // To get the biome at a single block position, we can use getBiomeAt().
        int scale = 1; // scale=1: block coordinates, scale=4: biome coordinates
        int x = 0, y = 63, z = 0;
        int biomeID = getBiomeAt(&g, scale, x, y, z);
        if (biomeID == mushroom_fields)
        {
            printf(""Seed %"" PRId64 "" has a Mushroom Fields biome at ""
                ""block position (%d, %d).\n"", (int64_t) seed, x, z);
            break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

You can compile this code either by directly adding a target to the makefile via
```
$ cd cubiomes
$ make libcubiomes
```
...or you can compile and link to a cubiomes archive using either of the following commands.
```
$ gcc find_biome_at.c libcubiomes.a -fwrapv -lm   # static
$ gcc find_biome_at.c -L. -lcubiomes -fwrapv -lm  # dynamic
```
Both commands assume that your source code is saved as `find_biome_at.c` in the cubiomes working directory. If your makefile is configured to use pthreads, you may also need to add the `-lpthread` option to the compiler.
The option `-fwrapv` enforces two's complement for signed integer overflow, which this library relies on. It is not strictly necessary for this example as the library should already be compiled with this flag, but it is good practice to prevent undefined behaviour.
Running the program should output:
```
$ ./a.out
Seed 262 has a Mushroom Fields biome at block position (0, 0).
```

### Biome Generation in a Range

We can also generate biomes for an area or volume using `genBiomes()`. This will utilize whatever optimizations are available for the generator and can be much faster than generating each position individually. (The layered generators for versions up to 1.17 will benefit significantly more from this than the noise-based ones.)

Before we can generate the biomes for an area or volume, we need to define the bounds with a `Range` structure and allocate the necessary buffer using `allocCache()`. The `Range` is described by a scale, position, and size, where each cell inside the `Range` represents `scale` many blocks in the horizontal axes. The vertical direction is treated separately and always follows the biome coordinate scaling of 1:4, with the exception of when `scale == 1`, in which case the vertical scaling is also 1:1.

The only supported values for `scale` are 1, 4, 16, 64, and (for the Overworld) 256. For versions up to 1.17, the scale is matched to an appropriate biome layer and will influence the biomes that can generate.

```C
// generate an image of the world
#include ""generator.h""
#include ""util.h""

int main()
{
    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, MC_1_18, LARGE_BIOMES);

    uint64_t seed = 123LL;
    applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

    Range r;
    // 1:16, a.k.a. horizontal chunk scaling
    r.scale = 16;
    // Define the position and size for a horizontal area:
    r.x = -60, r.z = -60;   // position (x,z)
    r.sx = 120, r.sz = 120; // size (width,height)
    // Set the vertical range as a plane near sea level at scale 1:4.
    r.y = 15, r.sy = 1;

    // Allocate the necessary cache for this range.
    int *biomeIds = allocCache(&g, r);

    // Generate the area inside biomeIds, indexed as:
    // biomeIds[i_y*r.sx*r.sz + i_z*r.sx + i_x]
    // where (i_x, i_y, i_z) is a position relative to the range cuboid.
    genBiomes(&g, biomeIds, r);

    // Map the biomes to an image buffer, with 4 pixels per biome cell.
    int pix4cell = 4;
    int imgWidth = pix4cell*r.sx, imgHeight = pix4cell*r.sz;
    unsigned char biomeColors[256][3];
    initBiomeColors(biomeColors);
    unsigned char *rgb = (unsigned char *) malloc(3*imgWidth*imgHeight);
    biomesToImage(rgb, biomeColors, biomeIds, r.sx, r.sz, pix4cell, 2);

    // Save the RGB buffer to a PPM image file.
    savePPM(""map.ppm"", rgb, imgWidth, imgHeight);

    // Clean up.
    free(biomeIds);
    free(rgb);

    return 0;
}
```


### Structure Generation

The generation of structures can usually be regarded as a two-stage process: generation attempts and biome checks. For most structures, Minecraft divides the world into a grid of regions (usually 32x32 chunks) and performs one generation attempt in each. We can use `getStructurePos()` to get the position of such a generation attempt, and then test whether a structure will actually generate there with `isViableStructurePos()`; however, this is more expensive to compute (requiring many microseconds instead of nanoseconds).

Note: some structures (in particular desert pyramids, jungle temples and woodland mansions) in 1.18 no longer depend solely on the biomes and can also fail to generate based on the surface height near the generation attempt. Unfortunately, cubiomes does not provide block level world generation and cannot check for this, and may therefore yield false positive positions. Support for an approximation for the surface height might be added in the future to improve accuracy.


```C
// find a seed with a certain structure at the origin chunk
#include ""finders.h""
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int structType = Outpost;
    int mc = MC_1_18;

    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);

    uint64_t lower48;
    for (lower48 = 0; ; lower48++)
    {
        // The structure position depends only on the region coordinates and
        // the lower 48-bits of the world seed.
        Pos p;
        if (!getStructurePos(structType, mc, lower48, 0, 0, &p))
            continue;

        // Look for a seed with the structure at the origin chunk.
        if (p.x >= 16 || p.z >= 16)
            continue;

        // Look for a full 64-bit seed with viable biomes.
        uint64_t upper16;
        for (upper16 = 0; upper16 < 0x10000; upper16++)
        {
            uint64_t seed = lower48 | (upper16 << 48);
            applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);
            if (isViableStructurePos(structType, &g, p.x, p.z, 0))
            {
                printf(""Seed %"" PRId64 "" has a Pillager Outpost at (%d, %d).\n"",
                    (int64_t) seed, p.x, p.z);
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Quad-Witch-Huts

A commonly desired feature are Quad-Witch-Huts or similar multi-structure clusters. To test for these types of seeds, we can look a little deeper into how the generation attempts are determined. Notice that the positions depend only on the structure type, region coordinates and the lower 48 bits of the seed. Also, once we have found a seed with the desired generation attemps, we can move them around by transforming the 48-bit seed using `moveStructure()`. This means there is a set of seed bases which can function as a starting point to generate all other seeds with similar structure placement.

The function `searchAll48()` can be used to find a complete set of 48-bit seed bases for a custom criterion. Given that in general it can take a very long time to check all 2^48 seeds (days or weeks), the function provides some functionality to save the results to disk which can be loaded again using `loadSavedSeeds()`. Luckily, it is possible in some cases to reduce the search space even further: for Swamp Huts and structures with a similar structure configuration, there are only a handful of constellations where the structures are close enough together to run simultaneously. Conveniently, these constellations differ uniquely at the lower 20 bits. (This is hard to prove, or at least I haven't found a rigorous proof that doesn't rely on brute forcing.) By specifying a list of lower 20-bit values, we can reduce the search space to the order of 2^28, which can be checked in a reasonable amount of time.


```C
// find seeds with a quad-witch-hut about the origin
#include ""quadbase.h""
#include <stdio.h>

int check(uint64_t s48, void *data)
{
    const StructureConfig sconf = *(const StructureConfig*) data;
    return isQuadBase(sconf, s48 - sconf.salt, 128);
}

int main()
{
    int styp = Swamp_Hut;
    int mc = MC_1_18;
    uint64_t basecnt = 0;
    uint64_t *bases = NULL;
    int threads = 8;
    Generator g;

    StructureConfig sconf;
    getStructureConfig(styp, mc, &sconf);

    printf(""Preparing seed bases...\n"");
    // Get all 48-bit quad-witch-hut bases, but consider only the best 20-bit
    // constellations where the structures are the closest together.
    int err = searchAll48(
        &bases, &basecnt, NULL, threads,
        low20QuadIdeal, sizeof(low20QuadIdeal) / sizeof(uint64_t), 20,
        check, &sconf
        );

    if (err || !bases)
    {
        printf(""Failed to generate seed bases.\n"");
        exit(1);
    }

    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);

    uint64_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < basecnt; i++)
    {
        // The quad bases by themselves have structures in regions (0,0)-(1,1)
        // so we can move them by -1 regions to have them around the origin.
        uint64_t s48 = moveStructure(bases[i] - sconf.salt, -1, -1);

        Pos pos[4];
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48, -1, -1, &pos[0]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48, -1,  0, &pos[1]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48,  0, -1, &pos[2]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48,  0,  0, &pos[3]);

        uint64_t high;
        for (high = 0; high < 0x10000; high++)
        {
            uint64_t seed = s48 | (high << 48);
            applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

            if (isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[0].x, pos[0].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[1].x, pos[1].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[2].x, pos[2].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[3].x, pos[3].z, 0))
            {
                printf(""%"" PRId64 ""\n"", (int64_t) seed);
            }
        }
    }

    free(bases);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Strongholds and Spawn

Strongholds, as well as the world spawn point, actually search until they find a suitable location, rather than checking a single spot like most other structures. This causes them to be particularly performance expensive to find. Furthermore, the positions of strongholds have to be generated in a certain order, which can be done in an iterative fashion with `initFirstStronghold()` and `nextStronghold()`. For the world spawn, the generation starts with a search for a suitable biome near the origin, and will continue until a grass or podzol block is found. There is no reliable way to check actual blocks, so the search relies on a statistic, matching grass presence to biomes. Alternatively, we can simply use `estimateSpawn()` and terminate the search after the first biome check under the assumption that grass is nearby.


```C
// find spawn and the first N strongholds
#include ""finders.h""
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int mc = MC_1_18;
    uint64_t seed = 3055141959546LL;

    // Only the first stronghold has a position which can be estimated
    // (+/-112 blocks) without biome check.
    StrongholdIter sh;
    Pos pos = initFirstStronghold(&sh, mc, seed);

    printf(""Seed: %"" PRId64 ""\n"", (int64_t) seed);
    printf(""Estimated position of first stronghold: (%d, %d)\n"", pos.x, pos.z);

    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);
    applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

    pos = getSpawn(&g);
    printf(""Spawn: (%d, %d)\n"", pos.x, pos.z);

    int i, N = 12;
    for (i = 1; i <= N; i++)
    {
        if (nextStronghold(&sh, &g) <= 0)
            break;
        printf(""Stronghold #%-3d: (%6d, %6d)\n"", i, sh.pos.x, sh.pos.z);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

# AnarchyExploitFixes

Fix exploits on a Minecraft Anarchy Server

[![bstats](https://bstats.org/signatures/bukkit/AnarchyExploitFixes.svg)](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/AnarchyExploitFixes/8700)

## NOTICE

This plugin has many features that are broken or do not work properly on version 1.19 or higher. Please submit pull
requests and issues for 1.19 problems.

## Requirements

* ProtocolLib - This is for preventing packet exploits, if it's not present these exploits will not be prevented, and
  you will get a warning message every minute.

## Prebuilt jar

### Go to releases, download the latest jar

If you wish to have a prebuilt BETA jar with the latest code, click Actions at the top of the page, click the
latest build, and download the artifact.

## Building from source

`git clone https://github.com/moom0o/AnarchyExploitFixes.git`

Run `mvn package`

## Servers using AEF:

Add your server in a pull request

constantiam.net (70-80), 5b5t.org (50-150), openanarchy.org (40-150), scfanarchy.ggs.gg (0-3)

## Commands

These commands are only able to be executed by console or opped players.

* /aef ver - Plugin version.
* /aef reload - Reload the config
* /aef kickphrase (phrase) - Kick all players that have said these words. Currently broken will fix when feel like it.
* /aef geared - See how many players have armor or are new.
* /aef elytra - See who is flying on an elytra.
* /aef lag - artificially lag the server for testing. Every time you run the command the server freezes for 1 second by
  default, add milliseconds to the end of the command for custom time.

## Contact

Need to let me know of any exploits in private? Contact me on discord: `moo#0529` or email `moom0o@protonmail.com`

## Notice

Please note that some exploits already patched
by [2LS ExploitFixer](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/2ls-exploitfixer-the-ultimate-antiexploit-plugin.62842/)
& [Papaya (My paper fork)](https://github.com/moom0o/Papaya) are probably not fixed in AEF, I recommend using those 2
alongside AEF to patch the majority of exploits.

## Features

**This list does not include all features, check the config for all features!**

**All features listed here can be disabled or enabled in the config.**

* Prevent NoCom exploit. - Prevent the 'NoCom' coordinate exploit
* Prevent a new lag exploit where fireworks can bring tps down to single digits.
* Prevent BowBomb exploit. - Prevent an exploit where bows can instantly kill a player.
* Prevent burrow hack - Where you step inside a block so crystals can't do any damage.
* Prevent boatfly exploit - Prevent the futureclient/rusherhack boatfly exploit.
* Prevent book-ban - All characters still work! The size of each page is just limited to 255 bytes (customizable). This
  allows to fill the whole page with latin characters. Characters that use more bytes such as Chinese may be limited in
  length.
* Prevent unbreakable packet elytra fly.
* Prevent packet fly exploit.
* Prevent end gateway crash exploit. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5nVBQeYo-I

> Connects [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) and [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) Servers by sending messages back and forth without any mods or plugins.

## In Action
![discord-mc](http://i.thedestruc7i0n.ca/I5anbg.gif)

## Features
- Sends message to and from Vanilla Minecraft servers with no plugins or mods
- Can send messages regarding
  - Advancements
  - Players joining and leaving
  - Player deaths
- Webhooks for sending messages
- Allows members with specific roles to send commands to Minecraft through Discord
- Can be run on a remote machine or locally on the same machine (see `IS_LOCAL_FILE` in the options below)
 
## Installation

Ensure you have Node v16.6+ installed. You can check the version you have installed with `node -v` in your terminal or command prompt.

Create a Discord bot here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

* Important: Ensure that the Bot has the **Server Members Intent** and the **Message Content Intent** (available on the ""Bot"" tab in your Application settings)

Then, add the bot to your Discord server using the following link, replace the Client ID with that of your bot.
```
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT ID>&scope=bot
```

In your Minecraft server.properties, make sure you have the following and restart the server:
```
enable-rcon=true
rcon.password=<your password>
rcon.port=<1-65535>
```

Clone this repository onto a server, copy ```config.example.json``` to ```config.json```. And edit the following config fields:

Set `DISCORD_TOKEN` to the Discord Bot token that you created.

Set `MINECRAFT_SERVER_RCON_IP`, `MINECRAFT_SERVER_RCON_PORT`, and `MINECRAFT_SERVER_RCON_PASSWORD` to the ip, rcon port, and rcon password respectively for your server. (127.0.0.1 can be used if Shulker is running on the same server as your Minecraft server)

If you are running Shulker on the same server as your Minecraft server, set `IS_LOCAL_FILE` to `true` and update `LOCAL_FILE_PATH` to the full path to your Minecraft server's latest log file. (ex: `minecraft_server/logs/latest.log`)

If you want to have Shulker running on a remote server, see [Remote](#remote-setup) below.

With developer mode (Settings > Appearance > Developer Mode) enabled, right click the channel you wish to have Shulker send messages to and click ""Copy ID"". Set `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` to this value.

Create a webhook in the channel (Right click on channel > Edit Channel > Integrations > Create Webhook or New Webhook), copy it, and set `WEBHOOK_URL` to this value.

Finally, start Shulker.
```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

```

## FAQ
* How do I make this work on a modded server?
  - Try replacing `REGEX_SERVER_PREFIX` with `""\\[Server thread/INFO\\] \\[.*\\]:""`
  
* Why can't I send commands even if I have the option enabled?
  - Make sure that you have a role on the server which is put in the array `SLASH_COMMAND_ROLES_IDS`.
    - e.g. `""SLASH_COMMAND_ROLES_IDS"": [""<role id>""]`

* I am using a local file and no messages are being sent!
  - Enable `DEBUG` in the config to check for any errors.
  - If you are on Windows, try enabling `FS_WATCH_FILE`.

## Remote Setup

Perform the following command on the server hosting the Minecraft server (in a screen/tmux session or background process, make sure to replace your `YOUR_URL` with whatever URL you're using (`localhost:8000` if running on the same server and default config) and `PATH_TO_MINECRAFT_SERVER_INSTALL` with the path to the Minecraft server installation, such as `/usr/home/minecraft_server/`):

```sh
tail -F /PATH_TO_MINECRAFT_SERVER_INSTALL/logs/latest.log | grep --line-buffered "": <"" | while read x ; do echo -ne $x | curl -X POST -d @- http://YOUR_URL/minecraft/hook ; done
```
(The above command will also be given to you if you are not using a local file when you first start up Shulker)

## Upgrade Instructions
From version 2 to version 3:
- The main change is that you need to split your `REGEX_MATCH_CHAT_MC` to both `REGEX_MATCH_CHAT_MC` and `REGEX_SERVER_PREFIX`.
  See the [configuration](#configuration) above for details.

## Upcoming
None

460,CZDanol/AnotherCraft,TeX,"# Anothercraft - visualisation of a procedurally generated voxel terrain
A master thesis project. Basically a Minecraft clone, I was focusing on accelerating things on GPU. There is a master thesis text in the repository, however it is in Czech. There's also a first few chapters of the english master thesis translated, then I lost the drive. I might eventually document some of the techniques on a blog or something.

Feel free to get inspired by the code. I'd be glad if you noticed me if you intend to use the code, no real limitations from my side, though. I probably won't be continuing on this project unless I get paid :D

Used texture pack: C-tetra by canna (under CC BY-NC 4.0 licence); downloaded from https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/16x-c-tetra-1-13/

## Minimum requirements
* GPU with GL 4.5+ (+ some ARBs, basically 4.6), 2 GB VRAM (4+ GB recommended)
* 2 GB available RAM (4+ GB recommended)

## Videos & screenshots

![](sshots/skybox4.png)

## Interesting technical stuff
1) Minecraft-like lighting system, but RGB and accelerated on GPU (light spread computing). Deferred shading. The way the model is designed results in a native ambient occlusion. (I'm sampling from a 3D light map texture, nodes are in centers of blocks, I offset the sampling position by half of the normal.
2) Block face aggergation. I am optimizing the rendered primitive count by aggregating neighbouring faces of blocks into one larger primitive. Calculation of this (together with calculation of which block faces are actually drawn) is done on GPU.
3) GPU-accelerated frustum culling.
4) Depth peeling (3 layers).
5) GPU-accelerated terrain generation. You program the generator on the CPU though (I have a wrapper for that). There are 2D/3D Perlin noise and Voronoi diagram thread cooperation shaders implemented. The generation is however quite slow, loading from a disc is like 10x faster and does not lag the game.
6) Even though a lot of stuff is accelerated on the GPU, you can still have custom block shapes and have practically a full control from CPU.
7) You can go to view distances up to 64 chunks and it still works quite well if you have a decent graphics card (you'll need 6 GB of VRAM for that though).
8) Memory requirements: 4 B per block on both RAM and VRAM. Chunk size is the same as in Minecraft.
9) I'm storing the save game in a SQLite database, which works quite well (compressed with zlib).

## How to build
There are Windows x64 and x86 binaries in the repository. It should compile on Linux, however there seems to be some problems.

1) Install a D compiler (preferably `dmd`, http://dlang.org, `sudo apt-get install dmd-compiler`)
2) (Already done for you for Windows) Download appropriate CSFML binaries from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/ (version 2.4; or build them, whatever makes you comfy).
3) (Already done for you for Windows) Put the shared libraries in the bin_XX folder & the static libraries in the lib_XX folder  (the XX is for example x86, x86_64 or so depending on the architecture).
4) (Already done for you for Windows) Download official sqlite3 binaries, put the dll in the bin_XX folder. For windows, generate .lib file to the lib_xx folder from the .dll using the implib tool downloaded here: https://digitalmars.com/download/freecompiler.html (basic utilites); command: `implib /system sqlite3.lib sqlite3.dll` ( https://digitalmars.com/ctg/implib.html ). Alternatively, you can download it from here: https://github.com/buggins/ddbc/tree/master/libs (Also already present for windows)
5) Run `dub build --build=release --arch=x86_64` (or without the `--arch=x86_64` for x86 build) in the root project folder (where dub.sdl is)
6) A binary should appear in the bin_XX folder"

===========

The premiere long-distance brush editor for [Sponge][Sponge].

Compilation
-----------

We use gradle to handle our dependencies.

- Check out this repository.
- Run ```./gradlew build```

The master branch is automatically build on our jenkins server ([VoxelSniper Jenkins Job][JenkinsJob]).

Issue Tracker Notes
-------------------

How do I create a ticket the right way?

- Seperate your reports. You think there is something wrong, but also want this new brush? Make life easier for us and create two tickets. We'd appriciate it big times.
- Don't tell us your story of life. We want facts and information. The more information about `the Problem` you give us, the easier it is for us to figure out what's wrong.
- Check the closed tickets first. Maybe someone created a similiar ticket already. If you think it's unresolved, then give us more information on there instead.

### Bug Report

Make sure to not tell us your story of life. We want brief descriptions of what's wrong to get directly to fixing.
Also try to make the title describe briefly what's wrong and attach things like logs or screenshots to help illustrate the issue further.

Here is an example, where an imaginary brush that should create a ball, creates a cube:

Title: `Brush A creates Cube instead of Ball`

```
Expected behaviour:
Brush A should create a ball with radius 5 when I set it to brush A with brush size 5.

Experienced behaviour:
Brush A created a cube instead.

Additional Information:
SpongeForge: 1.10.2-2052-5.0.0-BETA-1675
Minecraft Forge: 12.18.1.2057
VoxelSniper: 8.0.0
```

Additional Information like what java version the server runs on would be appriciated, but is not required at all times.

### Enhancement Request

This is where imagination comes in, but make sure to keep as it easy for us. As mentioned, we don't want your story of life. We want to know what you think would be a good enhancement.

Here is an example of an enhancement request.

Title: `Brush that creates lines`

```
Enhancement Proposal:
Creating a brush that creates a line.

Suggested usage:
You click two points with your arrow and it will create a line with blocks.

Reason of proposal:
It would be useful, since off angle lines are sometimes hard to make.
```

Keep in mind that those are guidelines.
We will still look into stuff that does not follow these guidlines, but it will give you an idea what we want in a ticket and make our life easier.

Pull Requests
-------------

We do accept pull requests and enhancements from third parties. Guidelines how to submit your pull requests properly and how to format your code will come.

Some rough guidelines for now:

- Keep the number of commits to a minimum. We want to look over the commit and basically see what you've done.
- Coding guidelines should try to comply to the checkstyle rules (checkstyle.xml) but not blindly. Use your mind to make smart decissions.
- Give us a good description to what you've done.
- Try to submit one change in one pull request and try to link it to the issue in the tracker if possible.

462,CaffeineMC/hydrogen-fabric,Java,"## Status
##### January 23rd, 2022

**This repository has been archived** as we do not have the time or resources needed to maintain the project. No further updates will be published, and
we won't be providing help for using it.

If you are looking for a replacement, consider taking a look at [FerriteCore](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ferritecore-fabric), as it
generally offers more significant improvements to memory usage in modded scenarios and is currently available for the latest version of Minecraft.

# Hydrogen (for Fabric)
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jellysquid3/hydrogen-fabric.svg)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/jellysquid3/hydrogen-fabric.svg)
![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/jellysquid3/hydrogen-fabric.svg)

Hydrogen is a free and open-source mod designed to reduce the game's memory requirements by implementing more
memory-efficient data structures and logic. It's primarily designed for more heavily modded scenarios, but can
offer (small) improvements even in lightly modded or vanilla scenarios.

The mod works on both the **client and server**, and **doesn't require the mod to be installed
on both sides**. However, the benefits of running Hydrogen on the server are pretty small as of the moment.

#### Why are these patches not in [Lithium](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric)?

Hydrogen relies on rather egregious hacks in order to load some code into the game, primarily because the Guava
library developers really do not want people re-implementing their interfaces. These hacks are ""safe"" in the sense
that the game will simply fail to start if a problem occurs, but are really rather not suitable for the standards
which Lithium intends to promote. In other words, this mod could be looked at as ""things too dirty to put in Lithium.""

### Installation instructions

Hydrogen relies on the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). Users should select Fabric for either the Minecraft launcher (client) or
the dedicated server (server) depending on their needs.
Once you have installed Fabric, place the Hydrogen .jar in the `mods` folder generated by Fabric.

### Community

If you'd like to get help with the mod, check out the latest developments, or be notified when there's a new release,
the Discord community might be for you! You can join the official server for my mods by clicking

### Building from source

If you're hacking on the code or would like to compile a custom build of Hydrogen from the latest sources, you'll want
to start here.

#### Prerequisites

You will need to install JDK 8 in order to build Hydrogen. You can either install this through a package manager such as
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows or [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) on other platforms. If you'd prefer to
not use a package manager, you can always grab the installers or packages directly from
[AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

On Windows, the Oracle JDK/JRE builds should be avoided where possible due to their poor quality. Always prefer using
the open-source builds from AdoptOpenJDK when possible.

#### Compiling

Navigate to the directory you've cloned this repository and launch a build with Gradle using `gradlew build` (Windows)
or `./gradlew build` (macOS/Linux). If you are not using the Gradle wrapper, simply replace `gradlew` with `gradle`
or the path to it.

The initial setup may take a few minutes. After Gradle has finished building everything, you can find the resulting
artifacts in `build/libs`.

### License

Hydrogen is licensed under GNU LGPLv3, a free and open-source license. For more information, please see the
[license file](https://github.com/jellysquid3/hydrogen-fabric/blob/1.16.x/dev/LICENSE.txt).

Minecraft multipurpose bot

This project are based on <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer"">mineflayer</a> & PrismarineJS repository

This program is part of the 3 of this project,
Each part can be run independently,
The other 2 parts are <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegionWebServer"">minecraftLegionWebServer</a> & <a href=""https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegionWebClient"">minecraftLegionWebClient</a>

I recommend using the other two modules to help the bots communicate and take commands through the WebUI.

## Watch the videos so you can see what it can do for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIz6o7cJITg&list=PLPwIRDkD3kwSdQ04LnzcGrLrlST9XoKjk&index=5

## Install with docker

1. You need to have installed [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/), you can go to official docker site and follow the installation guide for you OS
2. Create docker network if you have all services in same computer and if you not have already created

```
docker network create minecraftLegionNetwork
```

3. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegion.git
cd minecraftLegion
```

4. Copy and edit the config.js file

```js
 cp config_example.js config.js

 const config = {
  server: '127.0.0.1', // Minecraft Server
  port: '25565', // Minecraft Port
  masters: [{ name: 'PlayerName' }, { name: 'SecondPlayerName' }], // Optional when front end is not opened
  webServer: 'http://minecraftlegionwebserver', // host minecraftLegionWebServer Web, if is in docker locak you must use a default config
  webServerPort: '4001', // minecraftLegionWebServer PORT
  webServerPassword: 'admin', // password for websocket
  debugMode: false,
  customStart: false, // If server have a login or other system to play you can add your self start Ex: login pass pass (see custom_start/custom_example.js)
  autoRestart: true // When bot breaks they auto reconnect
}
module.exports = config

```

5. Start docker with node

```
docker run --rm -it --name minecraftLegion  --network minecraftLegionNetwork -v $PWD:/home/app -w /home/app -u node -p 4500-4550:4500-4550 -p 9229:9229 node:16.13-bullseye /bin/bash
```

6. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

7. Start connection to server

```
node index.js
```

Now you can manage the bots via front end

Click on Load New Bot and select name (password is not working for now)

For download and install frontend go to <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegionWebClient"">minecraftLegionWebClient</a>

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegion/master/docs/LoadBot.png)

## Next usages
For start again the bot only you need to start docker and start the node:
```
docker run --rm -it --name minecraftLegion  --network minecraftLegionNetwork -v $PWD:/home/app -w /home/app -u node -p 4500-4550:4500-4550 -p 9229:9229 node:16.13-bullseye /bin/bash
```

```
node index.js
```

## Manual update
You need to ""pull"" the new code and install the new dependencies

```
git pull
```
Start docker:

```
docker run --rm -it --name minecraftLegion  --network minecraftLegionNetwork -v $PWD:/home/app -w /home/app -u node -p 4500-4550:4500-4550 -p 9229:9229 node:16.13-bullseye /bin/bash
```
Install new dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Start bot
```
node index.js
```

# Usage of commands in chat:

**There only are the basic comands for full manage you must need to use a front end <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegionWebClient"">minecraftLegionWebClient</a>**

First, activate the bot attention ""hi namebot"" or ""hi all"" to start all bots simultaneously.

- `hi nameBot`

Make the bot/s follow you.

- `come`

Make the bot/s stand in the current position.

- `stay`

Start memorizing the positions used to save the way to chests or patrol (get the bots to follow you around)

- `set start way`

Save patrol, used for guard job (use command `set start way` before this one)

- `set save patrol`

For set max distance to attack mobs or players

- `set distance 30`

For set mode (pvp / pve / none), if bots are connected to minecraftLegionWebServer it wont attack other bots

- `set mode pvp`

Set job (Currently only finished Guard)

- `set job guard`

To help other bots in combat (need use minecraftLegionWebServer)

- `set help true`

to finish commands

- `bye`

For mining xyz_start xyz_end start_horientantion vertically / horizontalle
set miner x y z x y z x+ horizontally

# Current Jobs

- Guard
  - Do a patrol for look near enemies
- Miner
  - Make a tunel or hole
- Farmer
  - Do placing plants and sapling trees
  - Potatoes, Carrots, Wheat, Melon, Pumpkin, Sweet berries..
  - Sapling Trees -> Woodcutter
- Breeder
  - Feed animals! all types!
  - When there is surplus, sacrifice the surplus
- Sorter Job
  - The bot search all nearest chest and they sort all items based on ID item
  - Also send to the server and other bots you have in each chest, NOW ALL BOTS GO DIRECTLY TO THE CHEST THAT STORES THE ITEM!

# TODO

- Optimize Sorter Job, need too many interaction with chests for sort all the items
- Add custom Sort Items in chest, based on... any idea?
- Add more behavior into Sorter Job, -> Craft items? if detect in chests no have enough of XXX items then craft it if they can? (Example swords?)
- Make an Archer Job ( During how to have this behavior similar to guard job? )
- Optimize combat Guard Job ( combat creepers, PVP, destroy shields)
- Check day/night for sleep any sleep function? Add ""general config"" for send all bots to sleep for all jobs
- Add Job builder! based on mineflayer-builder & Schematichs
- Add placing torchs
- Check some bugs with mining job when have a too many lava or water
- Add a robust documentation =P
- Think about chat commands, currently it is faster / comfortable with the front end, but if anyone wants to configure all boot via chat commands?
- Add back guard
- Add ""world"" for the position, now the bots don't know if chest or positions is in nether / overworld / end, they breaks when is corring the portals

* Update mineflayer verion to latest

Please keep calm. I'm working hard on this project :D

469,bdsx/bdsx,TypeScript,"# BDSX : BDS + node.js
![logo](bdsx/images/icon.png)  
BDSX is a modification of Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server, supporting [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Because it is based on the offical BDS software, it includes all the features of vanilla Minecraft, but includes other features as well, such as hooking functions and packets to change behavior. 

## Features

* OS: Windows(Recommended), Linux with Wine(Unstable)
* All Minecraft BDS features
* All node.js features (*that are supported by ChakraCore. See [this page](https://github.com/bdsx/bdsx/wiki/Available-NPM-Modules) for more information)
* Debug with Visual Studio Code (You can debug plugins too)
* Intercept network packets
* [Custom Commands](https://github.com/bdsx/bdsx/wiki/Custom-Commands)
* Low-level hooking and [DLL Call](https://github.com/bdsx/bdsx/wiki/Call-DLL-Directly)
* Get IP Address & XUID (Example below)

```ts
import { events } from ""bdsx/event"";
import { MinecraftPacketIds } from 'bdsx/bds/packetids';
events.packetAfter(MinecraftPacketIds.Login).on((ptr, networkIdentifier, packetId)=>{
    const ip = networkIdentifier.getAddress();
    if (ptr.connreq === null) return; // Wrong client version
    const cert = ptr.connreq.getCertificate();
    const xuid = cert.getXuid();
    const username = cert.getId();
    console.log(`Connection: ${username}> IP=${ip}, XUID=${xuid}`);
});
```

## Usage
* Requirements
    * [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Please make sure your node is up to date.
    * [GIT](https://git-scm.com/download)
    * Wine (if using Linux)
* Recommended  
    * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

To download, clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bdsx/bdsx.git
```

### Debug & Launch with VSCode
When starting BDSX with VSCode, you need to
1. Open the project with VSCode
2. Install the legacy debugger. the suggestion dialog will be opened up on the right bottom corner.
3. Open a terminal (Ctrl+Shift+｀)
4. Run `npm i` to install npm packages and BDS
5. Press `F5` to build and run in VSCode

### Launch with the executable
Run `bdsx.bat` (or `bdsx.sh` on Linux) to start BDSX

### Manual instruction of the executable
1. Open a terminal to the bdsx folder
2. Run `npm i` to install npm packages and BDS
3. Use `tsc` to compile the typescript and use `bedrock_server.exe ..` in the `bedrock_server` directory. If on Linux, use `wine bedrock_server.exe ..` instead. 

## File Structure
```sh
[bdsx project]
├ [bdsx] # Core Library
├ [example_and_test] # Examples for using the BDSX API and tests of the BDSX API
├ [bedrock_server] # BDS installation
├ launcher.ts # Script for launching BDS
├ index.ts # Main entry point. This file is required by the launcher when BDS is fully started.
├ bdsx.sh # Executable for Linux
└ bdsx.bat # Executable for Windows 
```
> Please start your own code from ./index.ts

> By default index.ts imports example_and_test. To disable the examples simply remove the import or replace it with your own code.

> For examples, see the `example_and_test` folder. There are some plugins available on npm in the @bdsx organization as well.

# Minecraft Bedrock Edition Server
Made with ❤️ by Deb

## What Is It?

This is a smart and easy to use wrapper around the [Minecraft Bedrock Edition server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/) that automatically backs up to local storage and (optionally) Amazon S3 at regular intervals. Note that the server software that this wraps is, as of the time of writing, currently in alpha.

![2 Players](readme-assets/2-players.png)

### Bedrock Edition vs. Java Edition
This is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition server, so it is designed to be connected to using the cross platform compatible Windows 10, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Pocket editions of Minecraft, with a little luck. Though connecting to arbitrary servers (such as those set up using this software) from editions that are not the Windows 10 edition is not officially supported, there is a workaround that I tested that worked pretty well on Nintendo Switch, and which should(?) also work for other versions. (see the **Connecting from not Windows 10** section for info on how to do this)

[Official list of different Minecraft editions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034753992-Different-Minecraft-Editions)

### Who it's for
This is great for people who want to play online with their friends across different platforms using the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft, especially if they do not want to pay for a Minecraft Realms server and have a computer that they can turn on whenever they want to play to run the server.

If you're tech savvy enough, you could probably deploy this Node app to the cloud without much trouble, as long as the machine you're running it on has enough power to run a Minecraft server.

If you have the hardware and internet bandwidth, you can even go beyond the max number of players supported by a realms server, by tweaking the values in the config file. You can likely also go beyond the world size limit for a realms server (5GB as of the time of writing) - just be careful to keep an eye on your internet usage and backup configuration.

I've been playing with my friends, and this works great with our (relatively) small world sizes, giving us peace of mind since it periodically backs up our world in case we run into bugs in Mojang's alpha server software.

### Who it's not for
This server software is not designed to support dozens upon dozens of users, or for worlds whose sizes may expand to the order of gigabytes, since depending on your network connection, periodic backups may not work as well with large world sizes, even if your system's hardware can keep up. Furthermore, it has been written to be as easy as possible to get up and running and so does not have support for more advanced server features. Finally, Mojang's publicly released server software is (as of the time of writing) still in alpha, and therefore is inherently more prone to bugs. You can try, and there's a good chance it would work, given that it is running on a machine with sufficient hardware and network bandwidth, but do not be surprised if it does not.

## Setting It Up
![Getting Started](readme-assets/getting-started.png)

### System requirements
- A computer with internet access running [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/) or later, or Windows 10
  - An operating system which is based on Ubuntu 18.04 (such as [Linux Mint 19.3](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php)) also works
  - ~~Mojang also has a Windows 10 version of the alpha server software, but as of the time of writing, running this software on Windows 10 is not supported due to [broken backup functionality in the Windows 10 version of Mojang's software](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-2733)~~
  - There are, as of yet, no hard guidelines on the specs you'll need, but many entry level modern desktop computers should be able to support a handful of concurrent players. Don't quote me on this, though; Googling around is probably the way to go if you're worried about system requirements.
- You'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on this computer
  - You'll also need npm, which should be installed alongside Node.js if you install it using default settings
  - The earliest version of Node.js that I tested with was version 12.16.2
- You'll need to be able to access and enable port forwarding on your router if you want friends to join
  - I'll link a tutorial for this further down
- Finally, everyone who wants to join the server (even you) will need Minecraft Bedrock Edition and a Microsoft account to login and play online. Since no official Linux client exists for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, you won't be able to connect to the server from the same computer you're running it on, barring any virtual machine shenanigans

#### Optional requirements
These aren't really necessary, but make things much nicer
- A domain that your friends can connect to (I created a subdomain on a domain I already owned) so you don't have to have your IP address floating around in people's inboxes
- An [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) account so the server can automatically store backups to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

### Reading Minecraft's EULA
By using this software, you are agreeing to the official Minecraft [End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/), since this software automatically download's Mojang's software when you first run it.

### Downloading the code
Download and unzip the code from GitHub, or clone the repository. Make sure the code is in the directory where you want your world and local backups to live.

### Config file
Rename the `EXAMPLE_config.json` file to `config.json` and delete the comment lines at the top of the file. Then, change the values you want to change:
| Value | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `accept-official-minecraft-server-eula` | Whether or not you agree to the official Minecraft [End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/). **You must agree by setting this to true in order to run this software** |
|`minecraft-server-version`|The version of [Mojang's server software](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/) that will be downloaded and used. The default value of this is the latest version I've tested with, though you should theoretically be able to update this if you run into issues. Be careful about updating though, since Mojang may break some backwards compatiblity. If you update this and run `npm start` the software will try to download the server version you specify, though it won't delete the old version just in case.|
| `server-properties` | These are the base properties that define server behavior. Most should be self explanatory, but you can find more detailed descriptions [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#Bedrock_Edition_3). **Be careful about changing the server and level names after you've run the server, since this may mess up how the server locates backups** |
|`ui`|You can optionally set the `enabled` flag here to `true` in order to run a web based UI for basic server managing on the specified `port`. If you do so, you'll need to set `admin-code-sha256-hash` to the [sha256](https://xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator) hash of the code that needs to be entered in order to access the UI. Please be careful when sharing this and keep general password hygiene in mind.|
|`backup`|See the **The Backup System** section further down this page for more details on how this works|

### Amazon S3 cloud backups (optional)
If you want your backups to also be stored remotely, you'll need to set up the AWS connection:
1. Sign up for an [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) account, and make sure you can access the [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) console.
2. Set up your AWS credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` using the first step of [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html). It is highly recommended that you create an IAM user with access to only S3.
3. Set `use-aws-s3-backup` under the `backup` field of the `config.json` file to true.
4. Read the **The Backup System** section further down this page for more details on how the backup logic works. This is highly recommended if you're using Amazon S3 backups since tweaking the settings described there will affect the way your S3 storage is used.

**Warning: Keep an eye on the sizes of the backups that are uploaded to the S3 bucket - Minecraft worlds start out pretty small, but can become quite large, so uploading and downloading backups frequently could get expensive if things get too crazy. So far, I haven't had problems with my smallish world, but you can never be too careful. The software can be set up to automatically purge old backups, as is described further down this guide.**

### Starting the server
Since this is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) application, after you download the code, you need to run the following command from the terminal within the directory you installed it to:
`npm install`

After that, you can start the server with the following command:
`npm start`

You don't need to rerun `npm install` every time you run the server, just `npm start`

### Stopping the server
**DO NOT use Ctrl+C/termination/kill commands to stop the server**

The server has built in protections to restore the state of your world if it is killed in a non graceful manner or something else bad happens (that's what the backups are for), but you may lose all progress since your last save.

In order to properly stop the server, type in the following command:
`stop`

### Connecting to the server

#### Connecting to the UI
If you've enabled backups in the UI section of the config file, you can access the web UI on the port you've defined in the UI section, so if your UI port is `3000`, you'll be able to access the UI on the machine you're running the server on at `localhost:3000` in your browser. If you want other people to be able to access this admin UI, you can forward this port using the information in the next section, but be careful when doing this - while the UI has some protection against stuff like replay attacks, and every change request needs to be authenticated, the server does not (yet) have a UI killswitch or other mechanism to protect against repeated password guesses. Also avoid sharing the UI if you don't want other people to see stuff like the terminal ouput for the server, or a list of backups, since these requests do not require an admin code.

The UI allows you to monitor stuff such as recent server output and performance. You can also view connected players, manually create backups, restore backups, stop the server, etc.

#### Port forwarding/IP stuff
Take a note of the `server-port` field that you set under `server-properties` in `config.json`. This is the port that the server will listen on once you set up port forwarding, and you'll need to give this to anyone who wants to connect to it. The default value for this is `19132`.

First, you need to figure out what your machine's IP address within your local network is. I found mine using the `ifconfig` command in the terminal, but if that doesn't work, a little bit of Googling should help you find it. It's usually something like `192.168.(something).(something)`

Once you have your port, and the internal IP address of your machine, you need to set up port forwarding on your router. This can vary from router to router, but shouldn't be too tricky - I recommend Googling how to do this. You want to associate the port that your server will listen on to your machine's local ip address.

Also take a note of your external IP address - Googling 'what is my ip' will give this to you. (Google gives it to you within the search results page). If you don't link a domain, you'll have to give this to your friends so they can connect to your server, so be extremely careful who you share this with (also be very careful about who you share the domain with).

#### Linking a domain (optional)
Once again, Google will likely give you a much more comprehensive tutorial on how to do this than I can here. My domain is connected to Cloudflare, so I used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xfsH7bmSFc) to link my domain, though it should help even if you don't use Cloudflare. Note that when the tutorial says you should enter your ip address and port, you should use the external ip address you found by Googling, and the port you set in the config file. Once again, be extremely careful who you share this domain with.

#### Connecting from the Windows 10 Edition
Connecting from the Windows 10 edition is thankfully pretty easy

Open Minecraft, make sure you're logged in to your Microsoft account, and navigate to the 'servers' tab. Once there, you'll need to add your server.

- **Server Name**: I don't think the server name you enter matters, so enter whatever you like here
- **Server Address**: This depends on where you're connecting from, and whether or not you've linked your server to a domain
  - If you're on the same network as your server, enter your server's local ip address (the one you found with `ifconfig`) when setting up port forwarding
  - If you're on a different network (this is likely the case for your friends) and you don't have a linked domain, then you'll need to enter your external ip address you found through Google (having a linked domain is recommended, but if you do not have one, please be very careful about who you give out your ip to)
  - If you're on a different network and you do have a linked domain, just enter the domain
- **Port**: The port entered in `server-port` under the `server-properties` field of `config.json` (the default value for this is `19132`)

#### Connecting from the not Windows 10 Editon
If you're not using the Windows 10 Edition, you may still be able to connect. Try the same steps as the **Connecting from the Windows 10 Edition** section, and if that doesn't work, try [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalT_oR1nPM) to change your DNS to the BedrockConnect DNS followed by the Windows 10 connection steps again. The tutorial is designed for Switch, but following more or less the same steps should work for Xbox One if you're lucky. If not, once again, Google is your friend.

## The Backup System
![Redstone](readme-assets/redstone.png)

The `backup` field in the `config.json` file defines how the server behaves with regard to creating backups.

All backups are stored in the `backups` folder as zip files with the timestamp of the backup followed by the type of the backup. If `use-aws-s3-backup` is set to true, backups will also be synced to an Amazon S3 bucket.

### Types of backups

There are 4 types of backups that can be created by the server:

| Backup Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `SCHEDULED` | These types of backups are periodically created by the server at regular intervals, according to the value defined in `backup-frequency-minutes`. Be careful not to make this too small if your world size grows or as the time it takes to create backups increases, scheduled backups may overlap. If you keep the default value, this is unlikely to happen unless your world is very large and/or your internet is very slow. |
| `MANUAL` | Typing in the `backup` command causes one of these backups to be created. |
|`ON_STOP`| One of these backups is created every time the server is gracefully stopped using the `stop` command |
|`ON_FORCED_STOP`| If the server is killed ungracefully, it will try to create one of these types of backups. This is more like a 'last resort' that may also help with debugging. These backups are very sketchy and due to the nature of forced stops they could be incomplete, corrupted, or not uploaded to Amazon S3 properly. |

### Remote Backups

Whenever a backup is created, if `use-aws-s3-backup` is set to true, the software uploads (or in the case of `ON_FORCED_STOP` backups, attempts to upload) the backup to an Amazon S3 bucket for the account you set up.

### Restoring backups

Whenever the server starts, if `use-aws-s3-backup` is set to true, the latest backups according to creation time will be retrieved from Amazon S3 and added to the directory of local backups. After that, the latest backup that is not of the type `ON_FORCED_STOP` will be used to replace the state of the world on the server before starting the server. (so non backed up data will be lost) If the server is always shut down correctly, then this backup will always of the type `ON_STOP`.

**Warning: It's a good idea to make sure your computer's time is synced and consistent so the correct backups are always retrieved and restored**

If you want to restore a specific backup to the server when it is running, you can use the `force-restore <BACKUP_FILE_NAME>` command, which will create a separate backup of the current server state, gracefully stop the server, restore the backup you specified, and restart the server. You can also do this from the UI pretty easily.

This is also useful if you want to import your existing world into the server. Just make sure your level name matches the one in your config and create a zip file with your level (a folder matching the level name) at the root. Then name your zip file something you'll recognize, drop it into the `backups` folder and restore it either from the UI or the terminal. If you're unsure about the format, you can look at some of the backups the server creates on its own.

### Automatic purging of old backups

For both local, and remote backups, the software only keeps a limited number of backups, deleting the oldest ones once new ones are created. How many backups to keep is determined on a per type basis based on the values in `num-backups-to-keep-for-type`. Setting one of these values to `-1` means old backups of that type will never be deleted.

## Known issues
### Still in alpha

Mojang's server software, which this software uses, is still in alpha, so it could be buggy. One of my motivations for writing this software was so that the automatic backups could protect me from losing information due to bugs in the alpha server software. It's worked great for me and my friends so far, but as always, please be somewhat careful.

### ~~Windows incompatibilities~~ (Seemingly fixed)
~~The software currently only supports Ubuntu 18.04+ as of now, though a Windows 10 version of Mojang's server software does exist. This is because there is [an issue with the last version I checked that prevents backups from being effectively created](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-2733). This is kind of annoying since it means you can't run the server and connect to it from the same computer, barring virtual machines (Minecraft Bedrock Edition is available on Windows 10 but not Ubuntu). If the backup issue is fixed, and I get the time, lmk and I will add Windows 10 support so you don't need the extra machine and OS.~~
This issue seems to have been fixed somewhere around Mojang's server version `1.16.201.02`, and my testing seems fine so I've enabled Windows support in this repo. Lmk if you run into any issues.

### Scaling issues?
I wouldn't recommend using this server to host dozens upon dozens of clients. It might work well given the correct configuration values, hardware, and network bandwidth, but I haven't done any large scale tests, so attempt this at your own peril.

## Disclaimer
Please read the license for this repository. I am not responsible for any hardware/software/financial?/legal? problems, lost worlds, or any other issues that may arise when using this software. If you do lose information, however, I could help you if you open a GitHub issue, though once again I am not responsible for anything that may go wrong when attempting recovery.

If you do find a bug, opening an issue on GitHub would be great - as I've mentioned earlier, I play with my friends on a server running this software very often, so making the experience better for me, them, and anyone else who uses it is always a win.

"
474,simon816/Command-Block-Assembly,Python,"Command Block Assembly
======================

Command Block Assembly started off as a tool that compiled assembly instructions
into Minecraft commands.

It has now grown into a much larger suite of tools for compiling source code into Minecraft
commands, therefore the toolchain as a whole is known as the Minecraft Compiler Collection (MCC).


Minecraft Compiler Collection
=============================

The Minecraft Compiler Collection (MCC) is an umbrella tool composed of multiple compilers in a toolchain to
compile high level code into Minecraft commands. It shares some similarities with the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

MCC is composed of the following components:

## CBL Compiler

Command Block Language (CBL) is a C++ inspired programming language specifically designed for Minecraft commands.

CBL has been designed to abstract away from commands to the point where you don't need to consider the underlying mechanics.

The syntax is similar to C++ in a lot of ways. It also takes from Java's idea of having no pointers in the language.

### Example

```cpp
include ""Text""

type point {
    int x;
    int y;

    constructor(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    inline point operator +(point other) {
        return point(this.x + other.x, this.y + other.y);
    }

    inline point operator *(int val) {
        return point(this.x * val, this.y * val);
    }

    inline void print();
}

inline void point::print() {
    Text output;
    output += ""("";
    output.append_ref(this.x);
    output += "", "";
    output.append_ref(this.y);
    output += "")"";
    output.send_to_all();
}

void main() {
    point p1(2, 4);
    point p2(5, 9);
    p1 += p2;
    p1 *= 2;
    p1.print();
}
```

This example demonstrates several language features of CBL, some of which should be familiar to C++ programmers.

Because everything in this example can be determined statically (at compile time), the output is just:

```mcfunction
tellraw @a [{""text"":""(""},{""text"":""14""},{""text"":"", ""},{""text"":""26""},{""text"":"")""}]
```

### Documentation

See the [CBL Wiki](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/wiki/CBL) for more details on the CBL language.

## Assembler

The assembler in MCC is the original assembler when this project was just Command Block Assembly.

### Assembly Language

The assembly language is simple and has instructions similar to x86.

The language looks like the following:

```asm
#include foo.asm

; Useful comment

.my_const #1 ; A constant value
.my_ref my_const ; A constant reference

main:
    MOV #0x01, 0 ; Do the thing
    _loop: ADD my_const, 0
    JMP _loop
```

### Example

The first example code written for CBA was an assembly program that prints the fibinacci sequence until
the next value overflows:

```asm
.x 0x00
.y 0x01
.old_x 0x02
.counter 0x03

main:
    MOV #0, x
    MOV #1, y
    MOV #1, counter
    _loop:
    PRINT ""fib("", counter, "") = "", x
    SYNC
    ADD #1, counter
    MOV x, old_x
    MOV y, x
    ADD old_x, y
    CMP #0, x
    JGE _loop ; if not >=0 then x has overflowed
```

### Documentation

The instruction set and how write CBA programs is documented [on the wiki](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/wiki/Assembly-Language).

## C Compiler

MCC partially implements a C compiler, most language features are implemented and it includes a preprocessor.

The C compiler sits on top of the assembler - all C code is compiled into assembly which is then passed through MCC's assembler.

### Example

Here is the same fibinacci sequence program but implemented in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int x;
int y;
int old_x;
int counter;

void main() {
    x = 0;
    y = 1;
    counter = 1;
    do {
        printf(""fib(%d) = %d"", counter++, x);
        sync;
        old_x = x;
        x = y;
        y += old_x;
    } while(x >= 0);
}
```

### Documentation

The C compiler tries to stay as close as possible to the real C language, so documentation for most language features can be found elsewhere.


There is only one built-in type, `int`. Fundamentally, all data is stored in a scoreboard objective
which is a 32 bit signed integer.


The [mclib.h](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/blob/master/c_comp/include/mclib.h) file
contains several useful macros and definitions.


Browse the code in the [examples](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/tree/master/examples) directory to see working examples
of C code.


## Command IR Compiler

Command IR is _the_ intermediate representation used by MCC. All compilers above ultimately generate Command IR code.

It is designed to relate closely to Minecraft commands themselves but provide a level of abstraction and context which
enables optimizations among other things.

Command IR supports linking, which means it's possible to write code in CBL, C, ASM and IR directly and compile them
together into one program.

### Example

Here is a hello world program:
```
function hello {
    preamble {
        $all_players = selector a
        $message = text
        extern
    }

    compiletime {
        entry:
        text_append $message, ""Hello, ""
        text_append $message, ""World!""
    }

    begin:
    text_send $message, $all_players
    ret
}
```

The output is a file `hello.mcfunction`:
```mcfunction
tellraw @a [{""text"":""Hello, ""},{""text"":""World!""}]
```

### Documentation

Command IR's syntax, instruction reference and internal working is documented [on the wiki](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/wiki/Command-IR).

## Datapack Packer

Finally, to bring everything together and generate a [datapack](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack), MCC reads a ""Datapack Definition"" file
which declares how to package the code into a datapack.

The file is a simple INI file declaring attributes such as the namespace.

To complete the fibinacci example, the datapack definition file [`fib.dpd`](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/blob/master/examples/fib.dpd) is:
```ini
[Datapack]
namespace=fib
place location=0 56 0
description = An example datapack that prints the fibonacci sequence
```

### Documentation

Currently there is only one section in a DPD file, the **Datapack** section.

In order to create a datapack, two values are required: the `namespace` and the `place location`

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|namespace|The [namespace](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Namespaced_ID) used for functions in the datapack|
|place location|An absolute position in the world to place the utility command block. Specifiy as 3 space-separated numbers|
|spawn location|A position in the world to spawn the global armorstand. Specifiy as 3 space-separated components. Relative positioning (~) is allowed|
|description|Set the description of the datapack|
|generate cleanup|Generate a function which will remove everything created by the datapack|

# MCC pipeline

There are 3 main stages to the compiler pipeline:
1) Compiling: Converts source code into Command IR
2) Linking: Merges one or more Command IR files into one master file
3) Packing: Converts Command IR into Minecraft commands and creates a datapack from a datapack definition file

The MCC command takes a list of files, each code file goes through some number of transformations to end up as a Command IR object.

The linker merges each Command IR object into a single Command IR object. Any conflicts when merging will abort the compiler.

A datapack definition file is required for the packer. The packer takes the single Command IR object and generates the final
mcfunction files.

To get an idea of the hierarchy of components, here is a diagram:

```

            |               |

# Running MCC

You will need to generate the standalone parsers (from [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark)) using the `./build-parsers.sh` script.
If on Windows, run the `python` commands in that script from the root of this project.

The Lark python package needs to be installed, `pip` can be used on the `requirements.txt` file. It is recommended to use `virtualenv`.

Example: `virtualenv env --python=python3 && source env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
Once the parsers have been built, you don't technically need the virtual environment anymore. It can be deleted with
`deactivate && rm -rf env/`

Alternatively, you don't need to create the standalone parsers if you keep Lark available in the python environment.

MCC is implemented in python. Currently it is not bundled into an executable so it must be invoked using the python interpreter.

MCC is invoked by `python mcc.py` (If python 3 is not your default python command then run `python3 mcc.py`).

Command help text:
```
usage: mcc.py [-h] [-o outfile] [-E] [-c] [-S] [-dump-asm] [-O {0,1}]
              [-dump-ir] [-shared] [--dummy-datapack] [--stats]
              [--dump-commands] [--c-page-size SIZE]
              infile [infile ...]

Command line tool for the Minecraft Compiler Collection

positional arguments:
  infile              Input files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit

Output generation control:
  Options that control what stage in the output pipeline the compiler should
  stop at.

  -o outfile          Set the filename to write output to.
  -E                  Stop after running the preprocessor. Input files which
                      do not pass through a preprocessor are ignored.
  -c                  Compile source files, but do not link. An object file is
                      created for each source file
  -S                  Do not compile Command IR code. A Command IR file is
                      created for each non Command IR source file

C Compiler options:
  Options specific to the C compiler.

  -dump-asm           Print The generated ASM code to stdout. Compilation is
                      stopped after this point.

Optimization control:
  -O {0,1}            Control optimization level

Linker arguments:
  Arguments that control how the linker behaves.

  -dump-ir            Print Command IR textual representation to stdout after
                      linking objects, then exit

Packer arguments:
  Arguments that control how the packer behaves.

  -shared             Include a symbol table and other metadata to enable
                      dynamic linking of datapacks
  --dummy-datapack    Don't write an output datapack. This can be used for
                      debugging with --dump-commands
  --stats             Print statistics about the generated datapack
  --dump-commands     Dump the commands to stdout as they are written to the
                      datapack
  --c-page-size SIZE  Size of the memory page to generate if using the C
                      compiler
```

MCC will dispatch a different tool depending on what the file extension of each input file is:

 * `.cbl` Will compile the CBL source code file
 * `.c` Will compile the C source code file
 * `.asm` Will compile the assembly file
 * `.ir` Will read the Command IR file
 * `.o` Will load the pre-compiled Command IR object file
 * `.dpd` Will read the datapack definition file

Depending on the command line arguments, MCC will perform different tasks on each file. Some files
are ignored if they are not relevant for the desired action.

## Examples

Compiling `examples/fib.asm` into a datapack `fib.zip`:
```
python mcc.py examples/fib.asm examples/fib.dpd
```

Compiling `examples/hdd_driver.c` into Command IR `examples/hdd_driver.ir`:
```
python mcc.py examples/hdd_driver.c -S
```

Compiling `mylib.cbl` into an object file, statically linking `myprogram.cbl` with the object and `examples/fib.ir`,
then using `mydatapack.dpd` to create `mysuperdatapack.zip`:
```
python mcc.py mylib.cbl -c
python mcc.py mylib.o myprogram.cbl examples/fib.ir mydatapack.dpd -o mysuperdatapack.zip
```

This code follows the Minecraft Forge installation methodology. It will apply
some small patches to the vanilla MCP source code, giving you and it access 
to some of the data and functions you need to build a successful mod.

Note also that the patches are built against ""unrenamed"" MCP source code (aka
srgnames) - this means that you will not be able to read them directly against
normal code.

476,NYPL/historical-minecraft,Python,"#Historical Maps in Minecraft

*a project by Paul Beaudoin and Leonard Richardson*

As fans of Minecraft, and fans of real-world maps, we took advantage
of [the New York Public Library's huge collection of digitized
maps](http://www.nypl.org/node/80186) to experiment with converting a
historical map to a Minecraft world.

We chose to convert [this 1860 map of the Fort Washington
area](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/baa8b48a-d8d8-1066-e040-e00a180661dc)
into a Minecraft world. It's a topographical map, which means we can
convert it into a three-dimensional space. Most of its features are
features commonly seen in Minecraft--fields, water, dirt and stone
paths. Our experiment lets you virtually explore a nineteenth-century
Manhattan, a space that no longer exists.

We've generated two Minecraft versions of the Fort Washington
map. [The first
map](https://github.com/NYPL/historical-minecraft/tree/master/fort-washington/maps/fort-washington%20map%201)
is a simple creative-mode visualization of the historical map. [The
second
map](https://github.com/NYPL/historical-minecraft/tree/master/fort-washington/maps/fort-washington%20game%201)
turns historic Fort Washington into a Minecraft survival experience,
with valuable resources scattered beneath the ground.

[<img src=""img/rectified-map-ref-thumb.png""/>](img/rectified-map-ref.png)

Converting the map was a three-step process.

 1. Paul traced over the topographical lines on the historical map and
    generated a bitmap image showing the estimated elevation at every
    point on the map. This gave the maximum height (y-coordinate) for
    every (x,z) coordinate in the Minecraft world.

    [<img src=""img/elevation-thumb.png""/>](img/elevation.png)

 2. Paul then traced over the map's major features and generated a
    second bitmap image that color-coded each pixel according to which
    Minecraft block (dirt, grass, cobblestone, etc.) should be exposed
    at that (x,z) coordinate in the Minecraft world.

    [<img src=""img/features-thumb.png""/>](img/features.png)

 3. Leonard wrote a Python script that combines the two bitmap images
    into a three-dimensional Minecraft world.

    [<img src=""img/in-game-thumb.png""/>](img/in-game.png)

##I. Generating the Elevation TIFF

[<img src=""img/elevation-thumb.png""/>](img/elevation.png)

The elevation tiff is a black & white bitmap representing the elevation at each pixel of the map as a value from pure black (0 elevation) to pure white (highest elevation)

###Requirements

QGIS 2.2.0 ( http://qgis.org )
 - Activate Contour plugin
 - Activate GRASS plugin if not already activated 

A map image to work from
 - We used a geo-rectified TIFF exported from [this map](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/maps/16089#Rectify_tab) but any high rez scan of a map with elevation data and features will suffice.

###Process:

Layer > Add Raster Layer > [select rectified tiff]
 - Repeat for each tiff to be analyzed

Layer > New > New Shapefile Layer
 - Type: Point
 - New Attribute: add 'elevation' type whole number
 - remove id

Contour (plugin)
 - Vector Layer: choose points layer just created
 - Data field: elevation
 - Number: at least 20 (maybe.. number of distinct elevations + 2)
 - Layer name: default is fine

Export and import contours as vector layer:
 - right click save (e.g. port-washington-contours.shp)
 - May report error like ""Only 19 of 20 features written."" Doesn't seem to matter much

Layer > Add Vector Layer > [add .shp layer just exported]

Edit Current Grass Region (to reduce rendering time)
 - clip to minimal lat longs

Open Grass Tools
 - Modules List: Select ""v.in.ogr.qgis""
 - Select recently added contours layer
 - Run, View output, and close

Open Grass Tools
 - Modules List: Select ""v.to.rast.attr""
 - Name of input vector map: (layer just generated)
 - Attribute field: elevation
 - Run, View output, and close

Open Grass Tools
 - Modules List: Select ""r.surf.contour""
 - Name of existing raster map containing colors: (layer just generated)
 - Run (will take a while), View output, and close

Hide points and contours (and anything else above bw elevation image)
Project > Save as Image

You may want to create a cropped version of the result to remove un-analyzed/messy edges

##II. Generating the Features TIFF

[<img src=""img/features-thumb.png""/>](img/features.png)

The features tiff represents the roads, paths, stationary water
bodies, running water bodies, and buildings of the map.

###Requirements

Inkscape & imagemagick

###Process
In Inkscape, import the original rectified tiff and the elevation tiff as a reference, making sure one perfectly overlays the other. Import the cropped elevation tiff on top of that and make sure it perfectly matches up with the uncropped elevation tiff behind it. With the cropped elevation tiff selected, do File > Document Properties > Page > Custom Size > Resize page to drawing or selection. This will ensure that when you export from Inkscape, the result is exactly the same size and corresponds pixel-to-pixel with the elevation tiff.

Depending on what features will be identified, set up separate layers for roads, paths, stationary water, streams, and buildings. Proceed to trace the features using the line/bezier tool. ""Path > Stroke to path"" is your friend when tracing creeks and paths with mostly regular widths. Placing features of similar type on independent layers makes it easier to mass assign colors by type. 

Each distinct resource types will be colored differently. In our case we decided that I would indicate the resource type by manipulating the R value of the color:

 - 10 dirt
 - 20 grass
 - 30 cobble
 - 40 stone brick
 - 200 water
 - 210 flowing water

Since G and B were ignored by the map generation code, I was able to manipulate G and B to my liking to create visual distinction when editing. For example, paths were colored RGB(10,228,61,255), which appears lime green, whereas roads were colored RGB(30,143,95,255), which appears dark green.

If there are any transparent areas remaining, set the document background color to whatever tile should be your default (e.g. grass)

Save your SVG. Export to TIFF using imagemagick:

    convert +antialias -depth 8 features.svg features.tif

This should produce a TIFF without anti-aliasing. (The -depth 8 flag converts it from 16 bit, which PIL can't read.) Open the image and zoom to an edge to confirm there are no intermediate color values. See below for rationale and troubleshooting. (If PIL complains when opening the tiff, you may need to open in GIMP and re-save.)

####Anti-Aliasing Troubleshooting

At writing, Inkscape isn't able to suppress anti-aliasing when exporting to raster. Whereas anti-aliasing is almost always a benefit, it's frustrating if you're trying to maintain specific R values. With anti-aliasing, pixels of intermediate value are created at the edges of shapes. For example, at the intersection of dirt and grass, a pixel with R value 15 was common (corresponding to half of 10 + 20). Leonard's python code was modified to round to the nearest accepted value when processing these edge values. Additionally the R values were reassigned to prevent, for example, blocks of water appearing at the intersection of road and grass (i.e. presume rounding errors will occur and ensure they're acceptable accidents).

Several attempts to force SVGs to render without anti-aliasing failed:

1. Reduce color pallette to 6 in GIMP. 
  - This worked, but created a lot of incorrect pixels at intersections.
1. Add crispEdges directives to all shapes:
  - e.g. `sed -i '.orig' 's/style=""[^""]*""/&\'$'\nshape-rendering=""crispEdges""/g' $file > $file~`
  - This was promising, but you're at the mercy of the viewer, and none seemed to respect it.

Ultimately imagemagick with +antialias worked for me. I gather that the success of this method is tied to the SVG renderer built with imagemagick. This is what I have:

    convert -list format | grep SVG
     MSVG  SVG       rw+   ImageMagick's own SVG internal renderer
      SVG  SVG       rw+   Scalable Vector Graphics (XML 2.7.3)
     SVGZ  SVG       rw+   Compressed Scalable Vector Graphics (XML 2.7.3)

# III. Building the world

[<img src=""img/in-game-thumb.png""/>](img/in-game.png)

The [script for generating the
worlds](https://github.com/NYPL/historical-minecraft/blob/master/fort-washington/generate_map.py)
uses [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) to load the TIFF
bitmaps into memory, and
[pymclevel](https://github.com/mcedit/pymclevel) to generate a
Minecraft worlds, one block at a time. It's run successfully on both
Mac OS X and Linux.

The script starts by calculating how large the world needs to be. It
scales down the elevation bitmap so that a height of 0 on the bitmap
corresponds to a height of 12 on the Minecraft map. (This avoids
problems with void fog.)

Then, the script generates the world and enough chunks to hold the
map. It creates a wall of glass around the map area. It then generates
a pillar of stone at every (x,z) coordinate covered by the map. The
height of each pillar is controlled by the elevation bitmap, and the
block at the top of each pillar is controlled by the feature bitmap.

The world is a ""superflat""-type world whose terrain consists entirely
of air blocks. This ensures that venturing outside the glass-encosed
map area will not cause Minecraft to generate new terrain.

To avoid discolored grass, the biome of every (x,z) coordinate on the
map is set to Plains (for a survival-mode map) or to Ocean (for a
creative-mode map).

482,Twister915/mcproto-rs,Rust,"# mcproto-rs

This is an implementation of serialization and deserialization of the minecraft protocol.

This crate can be used to implement any version of the minecraft protocol, and has an example implementation of version 
1.15.2 included as module `v1_15_2`.

To implement your own protocol, consult this example, and use the macros to define a protocol to your heart's content!

More documentation to come, just dumping the code since I finished it.

Usage:
```toml
[dependencies]
mcproto-rs = ""0.2.0""
```

## `#![no_std]`

You can use this crate without the standard library (but requiring `alloc`) by setting `default-features = false` in 
your Cargo.toml. This will only disable the `UUID4::random()` function, which requires `OsRandom` to generate a random UUID."

## About
Matter Overdrive is a Minecraft mod inspired by the popular Sci-fi TV series Star Trek. It dwells in the concept of replicating and transforming one type matter into another.
Although it may seem overpowered, Matter Overdrive takes a more realistic approach and requires the player to build a complex system before even the simplest replication can be achieved.

Connect to many different server versions from your Fabric client!

## Social
Discord: https://discord.gg/Jg7Bun7
Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/earthcomputer

## Why another protocol translator?
Multiconnect distinguishes itself from similar projects such as ViaVersion and ProtocolSupport in that it is
very much client-side. Crucially, this means it can (and does) fix many version differences on the client;
such issues are unfixable on the server. As of the time of writing, multiconnect is the only mod which fixes
1.12 swimming mechanics, parkour differences, and re-adds removed features such as command syntax on the client.

On the other hand, multiconnect supports only the latest Minecraft client version, and only on Fabric. It also
does not have as much version coverage as ViaVersion and ProtocolSupport (yet).

### Usage with ViaFabric
If you want to connect to servers older than what multiconnect can currently support, you can install
[ViaFabric](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaFabric) alongside multiconnect, the two are compatible -
multiconnect will translate as much as it can, ViaFabric will take you the rest of the way. Follow the
instructions in the ViaFabric readme for details on how to do this.

### Other alternatives
- [ClientViaVersion](https://github.com/Gerrygames/ClientViaVersion): a discontinued plugin for The 5zig Mod
which supported client versions 1.7.10, 1.8, 1.8.9, 1.12 and 1.12.2.
- [ViaVersion](https://viaversion.com/), [ProtocolSupport](https://protocol.support/): server-side protocol
bridges.

## Installation for Players
1. Download and run the [Fabric installer](https://fabricmc.net/use).
   - Click the ""vanilla"" button, leave the other settings as they are,
     and click ""download installer"".
   - Note: this step may vary if you aren't using the vanilla launcher
     or an old version of Minecraft.
1. Download multiconnect from the [releases page](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/multiconnect/releases)
   and move it to the mods folder (`.minecraft/mods`).

## Build Instructions
1. Building requires JDK17.
2. 
   1. On Windows, run `gradlew build`
   2. On Linux and MacOS, run `./gradlew build`
   3. Note: sometimes, especially on development versions, the tests may fail. To skip the tests, use `./gradlew build -x test`
3. The JAR file can be found in `build/libs` (it's the one with the shortest name).

## Installation for Mod Developers
Looking to support custom payloads? Check out [this document](docs/custom_payloads.md).

This section is for when you are developing your own mod and want to use the multiconnect API, or run multiconnect alongside your mod in the IDE. Aside from the first step, you ONLY need to follow the steps applicable to you and your mod.
1. Explicitly setting a repository is not necessary, as multiconnect is hosted on Maven Central.
1. If you want to use the API inside your mod, you will have to jar-in-jar it for the release and add it to the classpath. To do this, add the following to your `dependencies {}` block:
   ```groovy
   dependencies {
      // ...
      modImplementation('net.earthcomputer.multiconnect:multiconnect-api:<version>') { transitive = false }
      include('net.earthcomputer.multiconnect:multiconnect-api:<version>') { transitive = false }
   }
   ```
   - Note: replace `<version>` with the version of multiconnect you want to depend on.
   - Note: SKIP the `include` part if your mod is NOT using the API in any way.
1. If you want to run multiconnect in the IDE alongside your mod, add the following to your `dependencies {}` block:
   ```groovy
   dependencies {
      // ...
      modRuntimeOnly('net.earthcomputer.multiconnect:multiconnect-slim:<version>') { transitive = false }
   }
   ```
   - Note: the previous step should also be done alongside this step.
   - Note: this step is only necessary if you want to run the full mod in the IDE. Otherwise you can skip this step.

489,kbsriram/mcpiapi,Python,"#Minecraft Pi API mod

This is a [Minecraft Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Universal) mod that reimplements (a subset of) the Minecraft Pi edition API.

The Minecraft Pi Edition also contains a [simple to use API](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft.html). My plugin recreates this simple API in your desktop Minecraft, so you can now program your Desktop edition Minecraft easily using the Pi API.

##Screenshots

Outside the skyscraper and shuttle, built using Martin O'Hanlon's [massive 3d structures project](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2013/03/minecraft-pi-edition-create-massive-3d.html).

![Massive structures](../master/downloads/massive.jpg?raw=true)

Running the sokoban demo from the standard [API library](http://pi.minecraft.net/)

![Sokoban](../master/downloads/sokoban.jpg?raw=true)

I've added an in-game command `/python` which calls an `mcpi` python script you place in a special directory. [This example](mcpimods/python/clear.py) clears a cubiod of blocks in front of you.

![Clear a cuboid of blocks](../master/downloads/clear_mod.gif?raw=true)

##Installing

This plugin works with the 1.7.10 version of Minecraft.

If you haven't installed Minecraft Forge, take a look at the
[installation instructions for
Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Universal).

Once you've successfully installed Minecraft Forge, [download
the jar file](../master/downloads/McpiApiMod-1.7.10-1.0.jar) to
your `minecraft/mods` folder.

If you've already programmed the Pi edition with one of the client
libraries - the plugin starts up on the same port (4711) so your
code should work unchanged.

If you're new to programming the Pi API - Martin O'Hanlon has a nice
[introductory series of
articles](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft.html) that should
get you started.

I've included the python version of the Pi Edition client library and a few demos under the [`mcpimods/python`](mcpimods/python) directory. It adds support for some additional commands supported by the mod - but the mod should also work against the standard Pi edition client library.

To get the standard Pi Edition client library - download [the free Minecraft Pi
Edition](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.minecraft.net/pi/minecraft-pi-0.1.1.tar.gz)
and you should find java and python clients, as well as a few demos
under its `mcpi/api` directory.

Not all the commands from the standard client are implemented, and
I've probably botched up the right way to do many things -- this was
my first foray into writing a forge plugin. But I hope you find it
useful and fun nevertheless.

Functionally, this mod is similar to the [RaspberryJuice
plugin](https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice). However,
RasperryJuice runs on a Bukkit server, whereas this mod runs under any
client running Minecraft Forge.

##Enhancements

The forge mod tries to be compatible with the extended commands
supported by the [RaspberryJuice
plugin](https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice).

I've also added an in-game command `/python` which calls scripts you
place under a directory called `mcpimods/python` in your root
Minecraft installation.

The `mcpimods/` directory should be next to your Forge `mod/`
directory. For example, if (on a Mac) your Forge mod directory looks
like `Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods/`, you would place
your python scripts under `Library/Application
Support/minecraft/mcpimods/python`

From within the game, you simply call the name of your script (without
the `.py` extension) and it will launch the python script as an
external process.

This is best suited for running short commands rather than something
that runs in an infinite loop; but of course I hope you experiment and
find interesting things.

I've [bundled the python mcpi library](mcpimods/python) which has a
small demo client that [clears a cuboid of
blocks](mcpimods/python/clear.py). You should also be able to copy the
[`mcpimods`](mcpimods) directory to the root of your minecraft
installation and start using the `/python` in-game command from the
mod.

I've added some experimental commands:

`world.setTileEntityHex(x,y,z,hex)`, which takes an `x,y,z` position
relative to the spawn point, and an ASCII hex string representing a
tile entity in [NBT format](http://wiki.vg/NBT). The main purpose
was to have some (weak) support for importing schematic files, and you
can see [an experimental script](mcpimods/python/load.py) that tries to
load schematic files. It doesn't always do the right thing, but it's good enough to have some fun creating structures from [schematic files](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Schematic_file_format)

Reading an [autofarm schematic](http://www.minecraft-schematics.com/schematic/934/) via the in-game `/python` command.
![Reading a schematic](../master/downloads/load_mod.gif?raw=true)


`events.block.wait.hit()` waits until a block is hit, and returns the
`x,y,z` position of the block. This can be useful to avoid busy wait
loops from your code.

`events.entity.wait.movedTile()` waits until a player has moved
their tile position, and reports a `,` separated string like
`entityid,x,y,z`. The `x,y,z` position is the current tile position of
the player with `entityid`. This too is handy to avoid busy wait loops
in your code. Check out [this example](mcpimods/python/follow.py) for
a hello world type script for how to use this command.

`events.setting(key,value)` to configure events. Currently, just one
key is available -- `restrict_to_sword` and it takes `0` or `1` as its
boolean value. `events.setting(restrict_to_sword,0)` will remove the
(default) check that reports block hit events only when the player is
also holding a sword.

-----

Minecraft X-Ray is a program whose primary purpose is to aid in finding
valuable ores and resources inside a Minecraft world. By default, when you
select a resource type to highlight, X-Ray will cause any blocks of that
type to visibly glow within the range of loaded chunks. The glowing can
sometimes be a bit much, so you can also toggle the glowing on/off, which
will still leave all instances of the selected resource visible on the
screen.

Additionally, X-Ray is somewhat useful for taking a look at natural
underground caves, to find out how extensive they are, or even to help
find your way out if you're lost.

The original author of Minecraft X-Ray was plusminus, who was kind enough
to provide the sourcecode for that excellent application.

Minecraft X-Ray is released under the Modified BSD License.
See COPYING.txt for more information, and Changelog.txt for a complete
list of changes since X-Ray 2.7.  X-Ray uses various third-party libraries
for other tasks.  See COPYING.txt for details on their licensing, and
COPYING-*.txt for copies of the licenses themselves.

X-Ray includes code kindly provided by Eleazar Vega-Gonzalez and Saxon Parker.
Thanks a bunch!

See TODO.txt for a list of known bugs and things that I'd like to
implement, and BUILDING.txt if you wanted some info on building the project
yourself.

The official website for Minecraft X-Ray is currently:
    http://apocalyptech.com/minecraft-xray/
	
The official forum link is currently:
    http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1022&t=119356
	
Once again, many thanks to plusminus for writing X-Ray in the first place,
and providing the sourcecode so that it could be extended and maintained.

RUNNING
-------

There isn't an installer for this currently.  Perhaps one day...

Windows users should be able to run the program by just doubleclicking on
minecraft_xray.exe or minecraft_xray.bat.

Linux and OSX users should be able to doubleclick on either minecraft_xray.sh
or minecraft_xray_osx.command (the files are actually identical).

KEYS
----

Note that currently the mouse buttons cannot be specified in the properties
file, so those functions are hardcoded.  All keyboard commands can be
overridden, though.  The default keybindings are as follows:

    Movement
        Movement:       WASD
        Fly Upward:     SPACE

EXTRA BLOCK DEFINITIONS
-----------------------

As of version 3.3.0, X-Ray includes a mechanism to allow the user to
define custom block types.  X-Ray will read any block definition file
found inside the ""blockdefs"" directory inside .minecraft_xray.  This
is located at:

    Windows: %appdata%\.minecraft_xray\blockdefs\
    OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft_xray/blockdefs/
    Linux: ~/.minecraft_xray/blockdefs/

Each file must have a "".yaml"" extension, and X-Ray won't read any file
named ""minecraft.yaml"".  It would be best practice to name the file
after the mod you're intending to support, such as ""aether.yaml"".  The
file format is in YAML 1.1.  There should be some very detailed docs
contained inside the global ""minecraft.yaml"" file (you can find this
in X-Ray's own ""blockdefs"" directory, where you unpacked it).  Examples
(and a copy of the global minecraft.yaml file) can be found here:

    http://apocalyptech.com/minecraft-xray/modsupport.php

As mentioned above, X-Ray will automatically attempt to load any YAML
file it finds in the blockdefs directory, and it will display which ones
it was able to load on the opening dialog.  If your file doesn't show up
in the list, there's probably an error in it - you should be able to
find that error in the file minecraft_xray_output_log.txt in the root
X-Ray directory.  Linux and OSX users (and Windows users who use the .BAT
file instead of the .EXE) will see the errors on the console from which
X-Ray was launched, as well.

RENDERING DETAILS
-----------------

There are three main ""sliders"" available to control how things are
rendered: Visibility range, Highlighting range, and Lighting.

Visibility range specifies how many chunks away from the camera the
app will render at any one time.  The minimum is 3, the maximum is 8.

Highlighting range specifies how many chunks away from the camera the
app will highlight/glow the selected resources that you're looking for.
Often (with more common resources) you'll want to keep this value very
low.  Otherwise it becomes quite difficult to tell where you're actually
going.  For less common resources (like pumpkins or clay), you'll want
to have it set as high as possible, though.  Note that this will never
be able to highlight ores outside the set visibility range.

Lighting just determines the OpenGL ""fog"" value.  This is useful to have
a better sense of scale while moving around.  You can toggle into
""fullbright"" mode with F, which will disable the fog entirely.

In addition to the sliders, there are a few toggles which let you set
whether to always draw water and bedrock.  Water is on by default, and
bedrock is off by default (though it will of course show up if necessary,
regardless of this setting).

The ore highlighting glow can be toggled using the ""H"" key.  This will
cycle between the three states of ore highlighting glow.  The default is a
rainbow effect which one user has described as ""disco.""  The next selection
is a plain white highlighting which was the default until version 3.4.0.
Finally, the glow will be turned off entirely.  Note that with the glow
turned off, every instance of the specified ore will still be rendered
onscreen, so this toggle is still quite useful for tracking down ores.

The ""explored"" area toggle, basically just tints any blocks around torches with
a green color.  This makes it very easy to see where you've explored in
underground caves (and is fairly useless above ground).  It does this in a
7x7x7 cube centered around the torches, so the highlighting can easily ""bleed
over"" into adjacent tunnels where you might not have actually explored, but
it's usually very easy to tell when that's happened.

The toggle for grass sides will let you toggle the accurate grass sides
on or off.  Until version 3.2.0, Minecraft X-Ray drew grass as a solid block
of green, which I found occasionally handy while hollowing out mountains
and the like, to know where I could still dig out and where I was right up
against the edge.  X-Ray will now default to the more-accurate rendering,
but you can toggle back and forth with the ""G"" key.

Minecraft Beta 1.9 changed the way fences work slightly, so that they will
""connect"" up to adjacent solid blocks.  X-Ray will now, by default, render
fences that way, but you can toggle it with the ""C"" key, in case you're
viewing pre-1.9 maps.

By default, X-Ray will highlight Silverfish blocks with a red tint.  You can
toggle this on and off with the ""V"" key.

The ""U"" key can be used to toggle the rendering of chunk borders.  This will
draw a transparent box around the chunk the camera is currently in, so it's
easy to see what's inside your current chunk and what isn't.

The ""Slime Chunk"" option will turn on the highlighting of chunks which
should be able to spawn Slimes.  The highlighting will actually only occur
on the bottom part of the map, where the slimes themselves are actually
capable of spawning.  The equation used to calculate this was taken from
http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Slime#Spawning in early October, 2011,
when Beta 1.9-pre2 was out.  The equation may or may not be valid for
earlier or later versions of Minecraft, but should be at least valid
for Minecraft Beta 1.6 through Minecraft 1.0.  The default key to toggle
this highlighting is ""M"".  Note that in Minecraft versions prior to
Beta 1.9-pre5, slimes would spawn only under y=16, whereas from that point
on, slimes will spawn under y=40.  X-Ray will highlight up to y=40 for
all maps.

A sphere with mostly-arbitrary radius can be drawn on the map, which might
be helpful for planning out mob grinders or the like.  To toggle the sphere
on or off, use the forward slash key - it will default to centering around
the current camera position the first time, but remain at that point until
overridden.  To set a new sphere center, use the semicolon key.  The sphere
will start out with a radius of 24.  You can increase or decrease the radius
in 8-block increments using ""comma"" and ""period,"" within the bounds of 8
blocks and 128 blocks.  The sphere itself will be a bluish tone, and the
center will be marked with a small reddish sphere.  X-Ray will remember your
sphere settings for the last world in which you've enabled the sphere.

The rendering information popup can be toggled with ""R"" and is on by
default.  This will let you know what these various settings are set to.

CAMERA OPTIONS
--------------

For singleplayer worlds, there will be two camera presets: the spawnpoint,
and the location of the player.  In this case, INS/DEL isn't really any
different than using HOME/END to jump directly to those presets.  If you
use X-Ray to load a multiplayer world, though, there will also be a camera
preset for each multiplayer user discovered in the world folder, which you
can then cycle through using INS/DEL.  If you've imported a multiplayer
map into singleplayer, the app should create presets for the singleplayer
character AND any multiplayer users still found in the ""players"" directory.

If your world contains a Nether subdirectory, you can warp back and forth
between them with the ""N"" key.  The app will attempt to automatically
translate your position based on where you'd go if you had just used a
portal, though this should only be considered a rough estimate.  Note that
especially when in the Nether, it's possible to warp back to the Overworld
at a location where there isn't actually any map data.  Eventually I'll
try to check for this and make sure that you don't warp outside of the
map, but for now just use the camera presets to get back into known
territory if that happens to you.

By default, if you move forward, X-Ray will move directly towards the point
you're looking at, including up/down.  If you want to ""lock"" the camera to
the vertical axis, you can do so with ""L,"" at which time moving forward/back
will only move the camera horizontally.  You can still move the camera up
and down manually, of course.

OVERRIDING TEXTURES
-------------------

In general, X-Ray will attempt to use the same texture pack that Minecraft is
using, but there may be some circumstances where you want X-Ray to use a
particular texture.

X-Ray will look in four locations for the texture information to load, in this
order:

  1) Inside the following directory, as an override:

        Windows: %appdata%\.minecraft_xray\textures\
        OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft_xray/textures/
        Linux: ~/.minecraft_xray/textures/

  2) From the texture pack that Minecraft itself is set to use.

  3) From Minecraft's builtin texture pack. This could be a custom texture pack
     if you've patched the Minecraft JAR file directly with a texture pack,
     rather than using Minecraft's builtin texture-loading mechanisms

  4) From a bundled, built-in texturepack included with X-Ray itself.  This
     method should theoretically never fail, unless the X-Ray install directory
     has been modified.

The override texture directory mirrors the internal structure of the
texturepacks, but should not be a zipfile. Right now there are four files
that X-Ray could end up reading from this directory:

    terrain.png
    particles.png (for the ""fire"" texture)
    misc/water.png
    art/kz.png (this is the Paintings texture file)

So, rather than packing those inside a zipfile, just put them inside the
""textures"" directory and restart X-Ray, if you wanted to manually override a
texture.

Note that this *will* work for files specified in custom block definition
files (as described above).  For instance, if you're using Aethermod and want
to override the ""Icestone.png"" file, you'd put your own Icestone.png file into
.minecraft_xray/textures/aether/blocks/Icestone.png.

PROPERTIES FILE
---------------

X-Ray keeps a properties file at the following location, essentially right alongside
the "".minecraft"" directory that Minecraft itself uses:

    Windows: %appdata%\.minecraft_xray\xray.properties
    OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft_xray/xray.properties
    Linux: ~/.minecraft_xray/xray.properties 

As of X-Ray 3.5.0, all settings in this file can be set using the GUI, so there
shouldn't be any reason to edit it by hand.  If you do want to edit it by hand,
though, feel free - it's just a text file.

## What is this?

A basic Minecraft Pocket Edition (MCPE) server written in C#. Current goal is to create a server that has enterprise performance for large Minecraft multi-user gaming providers. Current servers handle 10-100 users per instance, the aim with MiNET is to deal with thousands. Priority is also to create interfaces, and to some extend, ready-made implementations of the most basic enterprise game-management features (users, worlds, etc.). With all likelyhood, MiNET will emerge into a Microsoft Cloud ready product.

As part of the project, I also deliver an up-to-date [automatically generated MCPE Protocol Specification](/src/MiNET/MiNET/Net/MCPE%20Protocol%20Documentation.md). This is a synery of that large parts of the communication code being generated using XML and T4 templates.

## Why do this?

This is actually a pet-project - a true father-son project that I do together with my son Oliver 6 years old. He is driving the requirements for this, doing much of prioritization of the order of implementation. He is a great fan of online-MCPE gaming, but still too young to play the ""real deal"". He also lacks the patience and understanding of laggy under-performant servers, and the consequences of that. He is also not a big fan of the kill-style game-modes around, so a sub-project of this is for him to create new kidz-friendly game-modes that we can implement in MiNET. Oliver was the one originally responsible for creating the scope of our project.

And as he really likes to tell his mother these days ""Mom, don't disturb daddy. He is working for me now!"". 6 years old, but I think you get the picture. I know he does.

496,Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed-1.12,,"# Vanilla-Normals-Renewed-1.12

This is an archive, for the most recent version look here : https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed

A shaders compatible minecraft texture pack, based on vanilla but with normals and proper glossiness information.
This version (renewed) is made for PBR, but still a WORK IN PROGRESS, so you may encounter some textures with strange behavior.

**⚠️ THIS VERSION IS NOT COMPATIBLE FOR MINECRAFT 1.13 AND ABOVE ⚠️**

## Description

I didn't want any of those fancy high-resolution texture packs in order to enjoy normal mapping and specular highlights.
So I decided to make my own, but based on vanilla textures.

This texture pack is free for everyone to use! However if you wish to support me, you can join my Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/Poudingue

## Copyright


You can do whatever you want with my texture pack, screenshots, videos, modifications for personal use or redistribution, as long as you don't sell it and provide a link to this page or my Patreon. Oh, and also, don't mix it with Realistico. Dead serious.

## Screenshots

⚠️ The screenshots provided here were made using SEUS renewed v1.0, the results will differ with other shaders ⚠️

Textures have bump mapping information, allowing parallax occlusion mapping and normal mapping.
Smoothness information is very important for the credibility of materials too, especially when the sun lights it at grazing angles.

![Normals and smoothness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18035775/34640565-eb2fc134-f2f4-11e7-9d06-c615fb50aed1.png)

Metals and smooth materials now have the correct information to compute reflections.
SEUS renewed heavily relies on Screen Space Reflections for this and don't take correctly roughness surfaces for it, so the reflections may be too shiny and imperfect. However using SEUS PTGI will provide Path-Traced reflections and indirect lighting, and correctly take into account roughness.

![Metal and smooth materials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18035775/34640564-eb1388de-f2f4-11e7-8597-e132e9cde2db.png)

## Installation

- Install a shader supporting normal and specular mapping. If you don't know which one, give this one a shot : https://sonicether.com/seus/ and if you want raytracing, it should also work properly with SEUS PTGI6 : https://www.patreon.com/sonicether

    1. To do this, you will first need to open a terminal window
    2. Then verify that git is installed by running `git --version` This will make sure that it is installed, and additionally, show what version is installed
        - If you get an output that looks like `git version 2.21.0` then it is installed.
        - If you get an output like this `bash: git: command not found` (Different shells will appear different, but most will basically state that the command wasn't found.) Different Distros have different approaches to installing software, if you're having trouble look up ""<insert Linux Distro Here> Install git""
    3. Once you have certified git is installed, move your terminal to the folder `~/.minecraft/resourcepacks` by running `cd ~/.minecraft/resourcepacks`
    4. After you're in the right folder, run 'git clone https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed-1.12.git` to clone the entire repository to your computer.
        - You will not need to zip the repo to have it work, Minecraft can handle unzipped texture packs.

##### Linux Git Update
    1. Please have installed the texture pack using the above guide. This won't work if you went on github, downloaded the Zip, and extracted it.
    2. Open up a terminal
    3. Change to the TEXTURE PACK'S folder by running `cd ~/.minecraft/resourcepacks/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed-1.12`
    4. Run `git pull origin' to download the latest version.
        - You might want to relaunch Minecraft after this to make sure it uses the latest textures.


#### Windows Git Install
    1. Install Git and add to the path (don't' worry there is a guide below)
        1. Open a web browser and [download](https://git-scm.com/download/win) the latest version of git
        2. Run the installer
            - When it comes to the ""Adjusting your PATH environment"" the middle option is recommended, as it allow for more flexibility, but doesn't cause problems.
            - When it comes to the ""Configuring the line ending conventions"", set it to ""Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings""
                - Linux and Windows use different line ending in text files, and this will prevent any problems.
            - When it comes to the "" Configuring the Terminal Emulator to use with Git Bash"" the Windows one is sufficient for most work
        3. Once it is installed, launch command prompt
            - Press the Windows key + ""R"", to open a run box, then type in cmd.exe, and press enter
        4. Change to the resourcepack folder using the command  `cd %AppData%/.minecraft/resourcepacks`
        5. Clone the repository to your computer by running git clone https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed-1.12.git
            - You will not need to zip the repo to have it work, Minecraft can handle unzipped texture packs.

##### Windows Git Update
    1. Please have installed the texture pack using the above guide. This won't work if you went on github, downloaded the Zip, and extracted it.
    2. Open up command prompt
        - Press the Windows key + ""R"", to open a run box, then type in cmd.exe, and press enter
    3. Change to the TEXTURE PACK'S folder by running `cd %appdata%/.minecraft/resourcepacks/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed-1.12`
    4. Then run `git pull origin' to download the latest version.
        - You might want to relaunch Minecraft after this to make sure it uses the latest textures.            

## Known Bugs (on SEUS PTGI E6)
- Double doors do not correctly take into account direction of light (for the second door)
- Parallax and normals behaves strangely on rotated textures (rails, for example)
- Insufficiently smooth metals do not look like metals if full raytrace reflections is not active. (This is what causes stripes on iron blocks)

This is lightweight minecraft limbo server, written on Java with Netty.
The main goal of the project is maximum simplicity with a minimum number of sent and processed packets.
This limbo is empty, there are no ability to set schematic building since 
this is not necessary. You can send useful information in chat or BossBar.

No plugins, no logs. The server is fully clear. It only able keep a lot of players while the main server is down.

The general features:
* High performance. The server not saves and not cached any useless (for limbo) data.
* Doesn't spawn threads per player. Uses fixed threads pool.
* Support for **BungeeCord** and **Velocity** info forwarding.
* Support for [BungeeGuard](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/79601/) handshake format.
* Multiple versions support.
* Fully configurable.
* Lightweight. App size around **2MB.**

1. Download the latest version of program **[here](https://github.com/Nan1t/NanoLimbo/releases)**
2. Put jar file in the folder you want.
3. Create a start script as you did it for Bukkit or BungeeCord with command like this:
`java -jar NanoLimbo-<version>.jar`
4. The server will create `settings.yml` file. It's a server configuration.
5. Configure it as you want and restart server.

### About player info forwarding

The server supports player info forwarding from the proxy. There are several types of info forwarding:

* `LEGACY` - The **BungeeCord** IP forwarding.
* `MODERN` - **Velocity** native info forwarding type.
* `BUNGEE_GUARD` - **BungeeGuard** forwarding type.

If you use BungeeCord, or Velocity with `LEGACY` forwarding, just set this type in the config.  
If you use Velocity with `MODERN` info forwarding, set this type and paste secret key from Velocity 
config into `secret` field.
If you installed BungeeGuard on your proxy, then use `BUNGEE_GUARD` forwarding type. 
Then add your tokens to `tokens` list.

# FAQ（常见问题）

[SlopeCraft FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md)

# 软件简介

SlopeCraft 是一款基于 Qt + Eigen + zlib 开发的、用于在 Minecraft 中生成立体地图画的软件。

与 Spritecraft 等像素画软件不同，SlopeCraft 是专门面向地图的像素画生成器，它设计的目的就是让你用地图将像素画记录下来，然后贴在物品展示框上。这里地图指游戏中可以记录地形的物品，而不是存档。

所以，SlopeCraft 的颜色调整模块是完全面向地图的，它不是为了让像素画在玩家视角中接近原图，而是为了让像素画在地图的“视角”中接近原图。

由于地图中的颜色与方块的相对高度有关，所以 SlopeCraft 生成地图画往往不是平板的，而是立体的，是人工地形。我们将其称为立体地图画。

一言以蔽之，SlopeCraft 是为地图而设计的。

正是因此，利用 SlopeCraft 制作的地图画的“画质”，比 Spritecraft 导出、再用地图记录的地图画要好很多 —— 因为专业。

## 地图画的游戏版本、类型、颜色空间和方块列表是怎么一回事？

在 SlopeCraft 中，你可以调节地图画所对应的游戏版本、地图画类型、转化方法和方块列表。我将一一简述这些参数是怎么回事。

### 1. 游戏版本

SlopeCraft 支持的 Minecraft 版本为 1.12\~1.17。其中从1.12到1.15的地图没有什么变化，最多只有204种颜色；而1.16则为了下界树木增加了28种颜色，达到了232色。1.17为深板岩、生铁块和发光地衣增加了12种颜色，达到了244色。（这里的颜色忽略透明）

### 2. 地图画类型

纯文件地图画可以使用到完整的204/232/244种颜色，享受最高的画质；但它不能导出为可建造的地图画，只能导出为地图文件，利用作弊的方法在存档中呈现。

立体地图画则牺牲了1/4的颜色，换来可以在原版生存实装的优点。这种地图画可以生成为三维地图画，也是这个软件的核心功能。

Flat类型的地图画是平板的。由于立体地图画实装的难度很高，我特意开发了平板地图画的功能。

平板地图画顾名思义，是传统平坦的像素画，它最容易实装，但只有纯文件地图画1/4的颜色：51/58/61色。

### 3. 转化算法

这是比较专业的部分。你地图画必须也只能由地图所允许的颜色组成，转化算法就是为图片中的每个像素匹配对应的地图颜色。转化算法的实质是不同的色差公式。

SlopeCraft中使用了6种转化算法：RGB、RGB+、HSV、Lab94、Lab00 和 XYZ。

此外，抖动算法会尝试用相近的颜色掺混弥补颜色稀少的缺点，用分辨率换颜色丰富度。

其中 RGB+ 模式对大多数图片的调整效果最好，我将它设为默认。但具体到每个像素画，你最好依次尝试一下，选择视觉效果最好的调整方案。

### 4. 方块列表

这是最为重要的部分，它与最终生成的地图画息息相关。简单来说，地图中的每个基础颜色往往对应着多种方块，但导出的时候我们只能给每个基础颜色选择一种对应的方块。

所以方块列表就是建造像素画的“材料表”，称之为方块列表。我预设了4种方块列表，分别为：Vanilla，Cheap，Elegant 和 Shiny。

Vanilla 方块列表尽量还原每一种基础颜色的“原汁原味”，如沙子的颜色就对应砂岩、钻石块的颜色就对应钻石块等。
它往往不太适合生存实装（废话，3000个钻石块爽死你），只适合创造模式演示，因此我命名为 Creative。

Cheap 是极度优化的方块列表，一切基础颜色都尽全力选择生存中最容易获得的、最廉价的方块，比如“下界”的颜色使用地狱岩、“白色”使用雪块。它适合生存的早期和中期。

Elegent 是“最优雅”的方块列表，它尽量选择了生存中可以量产，又“足够优雅”的方块，如“白色”使用白色混凝土。它适合生存的后期，是首选，也是默认。

Shiny 专为光影而生，它尽量选择可以发光的方块。

Custom 是自定义的方块列表，你可以自由的配置一切。

## SlopeCraft 的功能

SlopeCraft 包含以下核心功能：

导入图片、将图片转化为地图画、生成立体/平板/纯文件地图画、导出为投影文件/结构方块文件/地图数据文件/图片。

## 安装方法

无需安装。

## 使用方法

506,noxifoxi/minecraft-server-status,PHP,"# Lightweight Minecraft server status script for PHP

Copyright noxifoxi https://github.com/noxifoxi/minecraft-server-status

This lightweight script queries the server information from Minecraft java servers.

- `MinecraftServer.php` *(Minecraft 1.0.0+)* uses the query method and supports all servers with enabled queries.
- `MinecraftServerBasic.php` *(Minecraft Beta 1.8+)* can be used as a fallback if the server does not permit queries, if something else goes wrong or just a simple request is required.

## Features

* Queries the server if the server setting `enable-query` is enabled and parses the server infos.
* Fallback to read and parse the build-in server infos from Minecraft Beta 1.8+ servers.
* Lightweight and fast
* Simple error handling
* Easy to use

## Requirements

* PHP 7.0+

# How to use the script

In order to fetch advanced server information the server's **server.properties** has to have the following settings:
```properties
enable-query=true
query.port=25565
```
If `enable-query` is disabled (`false`) only basic information can be retrieved, methods of `MinecraftServerBasic.php` will be used then.

This is the suggested method for using this class to fetch server information:
```php
try {
	require_once('MinecraftServer.php');
	$server = new MinecraftServer('example-minecraft-host.com');
} catch (Exception $e) {
	// handle errors
}
```
If the script throws an Exception it's safe to assume that the server is offline (for you).

Arguments:
```php
MinecraftServer(string $host, int $port = 25565, int $timeout = 1)
```
- `host` - IP or domain
- `port` - Port where the Minecraft server is listening (Defaut: `25565`)
- `timeout` - how long is the script allowed try connecting to the server before it times out in seconds (Default: `1` second)

## Examples

### Check online/offline

```php
$server->online;
```

If the server is online the return value is `1` otherwise it's `0`.

### Get player count

```php
echo $server->numplayers . ' / ' . $server->maxplayers;
```

### Get a list of the online players names

```php
foreach($server->players as $player)
	echo $player . '<br>';
```

Note: `$server->players` returns an array of strings.

### Get everything

```php
$serverStatus = $server->getInfoArray();
```

Returns an array with all information the sever sent or the script was able to fetch.

## Default server properties

Some of these properties are only available when server query is enabled, properties marked with ""(Simple)"" are always available via the Simple class or fallback - if the server is online:
- **hostname** (Simple)
- **gametype**
- **game_id**
- **version**
- **plugins**
- **map**
- **numplayers** (Simple)
- **maxplayers** (Simple)
- **hostport** (Simple)
- **hostip** (Simple)
- **online** (Simple)
- **software**

Servers can add more than these default properties, check the keys of [Get everything](#get-everything) if you are unsure.

## Fallback

`MinecraftServer.php` automatically falls back using `MinecraftServerBasic.php` if the file is present in the same folder.

The [PojavLauncher Website](https://pojavlauncherteam.github.io/INSTALL.html#ios) has extensive documentation on how to install, set up, and play! For those who wish to install quickly, here's the basics (on iOS 12 or later):

Note: This is experimental, although game works smoothly, you should not set Render distance too much.

### Setup the sideload app
- For iOS 14.0-15.5beta4, [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore) is recommended to keep PojavLauncher permanently signed and have JIT enabled by itself.
- Otherwise, install [AltStore](https://altstore.io) or [SideStore](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore). Others will also work.
### Installing PojavLauncher
#### Release build (AltStore/SideStore trusted source)
- Add `PojavLauncher Repository` from Trusted Sources
- Tap `FREE` to begin installing.
#### Development build
- Download an IPA build of PojavLauncher in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/actions).
- Open the downloaded IPA in the sideload app to install.
### Enabling JIT
| Application         | AltStore | SideStore | TrollStore | JitStreamer | Jitterbug          | Jailbroken |

(*) AltServer running in local network is required.  
(+) iOS 12 and 13 will not be supported in a future PojavLauncher release.

## Known issues
* Some Forge versions may fail with `java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException`.
* The game will be prone to JetsamEvents. More specifically, random crashes might occurs if allocating too much resources.

508,ldtteam/MinecoloniesWiki,HTML,"# MineColonies Wiki

A wiki for the Minecraft mod [MineColonies](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies). Read it [here](https://wiki.minecolonies.ldtteam.com/)!

## Guidelines to pages

### Worker/building names
We want to avoid having to change a bazillion occurences all over the wiki in case we ever need to rename a worker or a building, for that reason there are 2 tags (`{% building %}` and `{% worker %}`) which you can use to write the name of the building/worker directly based on the name defined in the data files.

You can use these by doing `{% building %}` (only directly in the building source page) OR `{% building apiary %}` (when referring to a building outside of the building page itself). This setup is identical for the worker (by using `{% worker <key> %}`).

### Links
We have a lot of links in the website referring to other documentation pages, a lot of them are still configured with a manually written name + path, for example: `[Apiary](/source/buildings/apiary)`.

Going forwards we are using link templates, these are configured in the `_plugins` folder. These can refer to some commonly used link pages and can be expanded in the future aswell.

#### Buildings
In order to write a building link you have to write: `{% building_link apiary %}` where the key of the building can be found in the `_data/buildinginfo.yml` (top most entries in the file, i.e. `apiary`).

These link templates will automatically generate the path to the building aswell as use the proper name defined the in `_data/buildinginfo.yml`.

#### Workers
In order to write a worker link you have to write: `{% worker_link alchemist %}` where the key of the worker can be found in the `_data/workerinfo.yml` (top most entries in the file, i.e. `alchemist`).

These link templates will automatically generate the path to the worker aswell as use the proper name defined the in `_data/workerinfo.yml`.

#### Research
In order to write a research link you have to write: `{% research tree=""Civilian"" name=""Stamina"" %}` where the tree and name of the research have to match exactly the way they're written in the research page (this is so the path fragment is generated correctly).

## Testing locally
The project can be ran locally to test if your changes work as expected. You need the following installed to be able to run it.

- Ruby
    - Windows (recommended): https://rubyinstaller.org/ (this includes RubyGems and Bundler, make sure to get the Devkit installer to get native extensions)
    - Other: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation
- RubyGems: https://rubygems.org/pages/download
- Bundler: https://bundler.io/#getting-started
- Native extensions: https://www.msys2.org/

### Preparing the project
After cloning the project and having all the required tools installed you need to run:
`bundle install`

This will install all of the project dependencies defined in the `Gemfile`.

### Running the project
The project is served using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), this processes all of the files in the project and turns it into proper HTML before deploying it.

In order to serve the project locally you have to run:
`cd pages`
`bundle exec jekyll serve`"

# Mammoth: Horizontally scalable Minecraft server
### A Spigot plugin demonstrating WorldQL's database and message broker.

## What is Mammoth?
Mammoth uses WorldQL to scale a single Minecraft world across multiple server processes. Running multiple Minecraft server processes allows for better core utilization and allows for more players to enjoy a single world. A collection of Minecraft servers using this plugin to sync with a WorldQL server is called a *Mammoth cluster*.

Mammoth has two modes:
- **Sliced mode**: The world is divided on server boundaries. Areas near server boundaries are synchronized. When a player crosses a server boundary they are transferred alonside their inventory, effects, any ridden mobs, or nearby villagers.
- **Seamless mode** (experimental): The world is not divided any block changes and player movement are synced.

## How to use Mammoth

1. Set up WorldQL. Download the latest release for Linux from https://github.com/WorldQL/worldql_server/actions and extract it into a folder.
   1. Set up a database using the commands below (change the password):
    ```sql
       CREATE DATABASE worldql;
       CREATE USER dbuser_worldql WITH PASSWORD 'example';
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE worldql TO dbuser_worldql;
   ```
   3. Create a .env file with the following contents:
   ```
    WQL_SUBSCRIPTION_REGION_CUBE_SIZE=16
    WQL_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=""host=localhost dbname=worldql user=dbuser_worldql password=worldql""
   ```
2. Set up redis-server and run it on localhost.
3. Use https://github.com/WorldQL/mc_provisioner to create your Minecraft cluster. Download the latest version of the Mammoth plugin from https://github.com/WorldQL/mammoth/actions and place it in a plugins folder next to the provisioner executable.
4. Create the servers with `./provisioner init` and run them with `./provisioner start`.
5. The default config will be copied to all servers in the cluster. You can copy it into your top-level plugins folder and edit it to your desired configuration. Once you've made changes to your plugins folder, you can push it to all servers with `./provisioner stop && ./provisioner sync && ./provisioner start`.
6. Create a Velocity proxy server and add all your cluster servers to it with the names `mammoth_0`, `mammoth_1`, etc. You can change the server name prefix in config.yml.
7. Start the Velocity proxy and connect to it. It will be running in sliced mode by default with divisions every 100 blocks for demonstration purposes (you should set this to a value over 1000 for actual servers). Place blocks and cross a server border and watch everything sync.

## Features
- Cross-server TP.
  - /mtp teleports to another player regardless of their server by looking their position up across the cluster.
  - /mtpa sends an Essentials-style teleport request to a player.
  - /mtpaccept accepts a teleport request.


## History of Mammoth
- March 2020: Inspired by large Minecraft events (like Square Garden) and 2b2t, the original goal for horizontally scaling a Minecraft server by splitting the world was realized. I wanted a quarantine project, so I started working on it.
- April 2020: The first version of Mammoth was deployed and played by about 200 people. Game servers would ""claim"" chunks via a redis server entry. When a player moved between servers, there would be a visible disconnect+reconnect delay. This was overly complicated and is detailed in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jeIg34jGNuWTFUftrGySZa6M6S_VXok0J0-qqCBpJfw/edit?usp=sharing).
- May 2020: I shut the server down and did some analysis on the world files and how optimally the world was split between nodes (not very). The software had a ton of bugs and could be abused to infinitely duplicate mobs (even the Ender Dragon). I also realized that I didn't need a complex world claiming system, and could simply divide the world via a simple mathematical formula.
- Jun 2020: Released the second version of Mammoth which used a procedural world splitting technique.
- August 2020: SalC1 ran a server crash stream to test the software. I had a small lobby server designed to forward players to the correct cluster server, which immediately crashed. Regardless, over 600 people were able to connect over the course of the night and the project gained a lot of publicity.
- September 2020 - July 2021: Conception and initial development of WorldQL. A complete rewrite of Mammoth to use it.

You can read more about the development of this project [here](http://metaphysicaldeveloper.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/implementing-minecraft-in-webgl/)


Compiling
----

It requires Coffeescript 1.1.3+ (version 1.6.2+ for [source maps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)), and node.js 0.6+

To compile, run:

    cake c

The command above will also watch for any changes. If you just wanna compile the files, run:

    cake compile

If you wanna see the game locally, you need python, and you run 

    cake server

which simply runs


    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

enabling you to open the game on [http://localhost:8000/public/](http://localhost:8000/public/)


To run the tests, simply run:


    cake spec


The tests are powered by [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), and can also be seen
on the browser (useful for debugging) by opening http://localhost:8000/spec/web_runner.html

Coffeescript Source Maps
-----

Make sure you have the latest coffeescript running (see [this](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/2835) issue). Your source map file should look like this:

517,FlavioGarciaDev/MinecraftSkinPackCreator,C#,"# Minecraft Skin Pack Creator
Skin Pack Creator for the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft. It will create the .mcpack file so you can install it yourself or export directly to Minecraft.
There's a quick guide below.

![Alt text](Instructions/0.png ""Simple Windows Forms"")


## Quick Guide


### Menu overview:

  * **New Skin Pack**: Create a new .mcpack file and you add skins to it. 
  * **Open Skin Pack**: Open an existing .mcpack file, it will automatically fill the list and you can change anything you want. 
  * **Installed Packs**: Open the folder where Minecraft keeps all the installed skin packs. 
  * **Save**: It will create/update the pack you are currently editing. 
  * **Export to Minecraft**: It will save and open Minecraft to automatically import the pack you just made.


### Creating a new Skin Pack
After you downloaded the application from the **Releases** tab. Just run the **MinecraftSkinPackCreator.exe**.

![Alt text](Instructions/1.png ""Running the application"")

If you are creating a new Skin Pack, just click the **New Skin Pack**, and choose the location and name you want.

![Alt text](Instructions/2.png ""Creating a new pack"")

Then click **Add** to add a new skin to your pack. It will automatically fill the *Skin Name* and *Forma*' fields, you can change them if you want. The **Type** is default at *free* and is locked for now.
Then click on the button **Browse**, select the skin file you created or downloaded from somewhere.

You can repeat this process and add more skins to your pack.

![Alt text](Instructions/3.png ""Added skins"")

After adding all the skins you want, you have two options:
* Clicking **Save** will create your pack in the folder you chose before, then you can import it later.
* Clicking **Export to Minecraft** will also save but it will automatically run Minecraft and import your pack.

In this case I clicked **Export to Minecraft**.

![Alt text](Instructions/4.png ""Importing..."")

![Alt text](Instructions/5.png ""It worked!"")

And that's it!

### It didn't work?!

You can report bugs and suggest new features. I will try my best to fulfill them!

## 规则列表

### PCA 同步协议 (pcaSyncProtocol)

plusls carpet addition sync protocol

PCA 同步协议是一个用于在服务端和客户端之间同步 Entity，BlockEntity 的协议，目前被 [MasaGadget](https://github.com/plusls/MasaGadget) 用于实现多人游戏容器预览。

- 类型: `boolean`
- 默认值: `false`
- 参考选项: `true`, `false`
- 分类: `PCA`, `protocal`

### PCA 同步协议可同步玩家数据 (pcaSyncPlayerEntity)

该选项能决定哪些玩家的数据将会被 PCA 同步协议同步

NOBODY：所有玩家数据都无法同步

BOT：地毯 mod 召唤出的 bot 的数据可以被同步

OPS：地毯 mod 召唤出的 bot 的数据可以被同步， op 可以同步所有玩家的数据

OPS_AND_SELF：地毯 mod 召唤出的 bot 和玩家自己的数据可以被同步，op 可以同步所有玩家的数据

EVERYONE：所有人的数据都可以被同步

- 类型: `enum`
- 默认值: `OPS`
- 参考选项: `nobody`, `bot`, `ops`, `ops_and_self`, `everyone`
- 分类: `PCA`, `protocal`

### 空潜影盒可堆叠 (emptyShulkerBoxStack)

Carpet 默认实现的潜影盒可堆叠只能让潜影盒在地面上堆叠，无法在背包中以及容器中手动堆叠

对于 CarpetExtra 实现的潜影盒可堆叠则过于激进，它会导致空潜影盒从漏斗进入箱子时会自动堆叠，这样一来会影响比较器的输出导致一些机器坏掉

因此额外实现了一次 emptyShulkerBoxStack，开启本功能后既能手动堆叠潜影盒，同时不会影响漏斗和比较器的逻辑

本功能无法让潜影盒在地面上堆叠，建议结合 Carpet 的潜影盒堆叠使用

本功能需要客户端支持潜影盒堆叠，例如 tweakeroo

或者在客户端安装本 mod

- 类型: `boolean`

Compilate texture pack. It require for first run the game, because textures not included in repo.
For example you can download this texture pack from https://polyflore.net/projects/depixel
```
1. extract resource pack to directory ../resource-packs/1 (one level up from project root directory)
2. cd ./node_server
3. npm install
4. npm run compile-texture-pack
```

Start server:
```
// Run NodeJS v17.9.0 server!
cd ./node_server
npm run install
npm run start

# compile all include local server if need
npm run install-all

# compile ff-worker and auto start
npm run start-rebuild
```

## Commands
```JS
// Teleport current user to random location 
Qubatch.player.teleport('random', null);

// Toggle rain
Qubatch.render.setWeather('rain'); // rain|snow|clear

// Set block at current player coordinates
let pp = Qubatch.player.getBlockPos();
Qubatch.world.chunkManager.setBlock(pp.x, pp.y, pp.z, {id: 10}, true);

// Emulate user keyboard control
// .walk(direction, duration_milliseconds)
Qubatch.player.walk('forward', 2000); // forward|back|left|right

// 2. only owner or another admin can add new admin
// 3. owner cannot be removed from admins
/admin list
/admin add username
/admin remove username
```

## Server packets
Send particle animation from server to player:
```JS
const packets = [{
    name: ServerClient.CMD_PARTICLE_BLOCK_DESTROY,
    data: {
        pos: {x: 100, y: 100, z: 100},
        item: {id: 2}
    }
}];
chunk.sendAll(packets, []);
```
## Manage server by chat commands
- ### /gamerule doDaylightCycle false|true
    You can stop the day and night shift with the command /gamerule doDaylightCycle false
    To disable the day and night shift, you need to assign false to the rule
    At this moment, the current position of the sun and moon will be ""fixed"".
    Time will go on, but the change of day and night will freeze until you set the rule to true

    **Note!**  
    The command works only in worlds where the player has admin rights or he is its creator.  
    If you need to stop the daylight time, and it's dark now, then before disabling the day and night shift, you first need to set the daylight time with the command /time set day

- ### /time set day|midnight|night|noon
    You can change current world time by following commands
    * `/time set  day` equal to 07:00
    * `/time set  midnight` equal to 00
    * `/time set  night` equal to 19:00
    * `/time set  noon` equal to 12:00

    You can set specific daytime `/time set 16500` it equal to 16:30.  
    You can increase time by /add argument `/time add 1000`, this add one hour to current time.  

    **Note!**  
    The command works only in worlds where the player has admin rights or he is its creator.

- ### /vdist 2-16
    You can change view distance by this command
    * `/vdist 2` means 2 chunks showed around player
    * `/vdist 16` means 16 chunks render around player

    **Note!**  
    View distance can take number from 2 to 16

## Portals
You can made 3 type of portals:

- ### Portal to bottom caves
    - You must build a frame from OBSIDIAN (minimum size 4x5) and must activate the portal by applying FLINT_AND_STEEL to the inside of the frame;
    - You cannot activate the portal if the bottom border is below -500 blocks.

- ### Portal to flying islands (aether)
    - You must build a frame from GLOWSTONE (minimum size 4x5) and must activate the portal by applying FLINT_AND_STEEL to the inside of the frame;
    - You cannot activate the portal if the bottom border is above 500 blocks.

- ### Portal to routine world (main level)
    - You must build a frame from PRISMARINE (minimum size 4x5) and must activate the portal by applying FLINT_AND_STEEL to the inside of the frame;
    - You cannot activate the portal if the bottom border is between 0 - 500 blocks.

## Generate particles from server
```JS
const actions = new WorldAction();
// Where type can be one from [campfire_flame|explosion|music_note|torch_flame|...]
actions.addParticles([{type: 'explosion', pos: vec_center}]);
```

1. It is necessary to create an emitter, for example, as an explosion, it is disposable. The emitters are located in the `mesh/effect/emitter` folder

2. Next, the emitter must be registered in `mesh/effect/manager.js` after line 32

3. While the emitter method `canDelete()` returns true, it will exist and on each frame it will call the `emit()` method, which should return an array of generated particles, the answer may be an empty array, it will not affect anything, just this time no particles will be generated and the next frame will be called again the `emit()` method

4. The emitter has a static variable `textures`, there you need to register an array of texture addresses from the file `./www/resource_packs/extend/textures/effects.png`

5. For an example of creating a new emitter, see the `addExplosionParticles()` method in `./www/js/render.js`

### Important:
The explosion emitter is an example of a one-time emitter, it counts how many times the `emit()` method was called, and does not allow it to be done more than once, and its `canDelete()` method returns true if `emit()` was called at least once

## Assignment of classes related to particles:
1. `Mesh_Effect_Particle` - the basic particle of the effect with the implementation of physics
2. `Mesh_Effect` - a mesh that consists of particles generated by emitters
3. `Mesh_Effect_Manager` - Creates and destroys emitters, places particles generated by emitters in a mesh

## Debug
1. `F3` + `G` - toggle chunk borders OR by chat command `/chunkborders [true|false]`
2. `F3` + `B` - toggle mobs borders OR by chat command `/mobborders [true|false]`

## Performance
To best performance use Chrome and turn on this flag `chrome://flags/#enable-webgl-draft-extensions` (this enable multidraw for chunks)"

**Distribuer votre installeur**

Une fois les modifications effectuées sur votre fichier `Launcher.properties` vous devez faire un test sur votre ordinateur  
pour vous assurer que tout fonctionne correctement et que tout est jouable. 

Une fois cela fait vous pouvez simplement via un hébergeur classique ou directement via Discord faire télécharger votre installeur.
<br/><br/>
**Mettre à jour votre jeu**


Si vous faites une mise à jour de votre client, votre fichier .json ou votre fichier .zip, vous allez devoir modifier la valeur présente dans le fichier 
`CLIENT_Version.txt` par défaut à 1. Si vous le passez à 2, cela va mettre à jour lors du prochain lancement de l'installeur le jeu.

Vous devez répéter cette opération à chaque mise à jour.

**NOTE :** Vous devez uniquement mettre des nombres entiers ! (1 / 10 / 1999 et non 1.1 voir 2,5).
<br/><br/>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## II - Récupérer les sources de l'installeur

Pour récupérer le code source de l'installeur rien de plus simple, vous devez suivre les étapes suivantes.

### Prérequis

* Posseder un IDE (Eclipse / Intellij etc...)
* Posseder GIT

### Installation

1. Cloner le repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KinderrKill/MinecraftLauncher.git
   ```
2. Lancer la class `fr.kinderrkill.launcher.Main`

3. Modifier votre installeur à votre guise :)

### Explications des classes

Brièvement, voici comment a été codé l'installeur :

Package `fr.kinderrkill.launcher` :
1. `LauncherPanel` = Contient tout l'affichage et l'enregistrement des élements graphiques.
2. `LauncherWindow` = Initialization de la création de la fenêtre (Taille/Dimension).
3. `Main` = Classe principal de lancement de l'installeur

Package ""fr.kinderrkill.launcher.utils"" :
1. `Config` = Sert de liaison entre le fichier .properties et le code.
2. `Installer` = Contient les fonctions de téléchargement et lancement de l'installeur.
3. `MinecraftLauncherFilter` = Outil de filtre pour la recherche manuelle du launcher Minecraft.
4. `MinecraftLauncherFinder` = Outil de recherche de launcher Minecraft
5. `OSHelper` = Outil de détéction des systèmes d'exploitation et fonctions de navigation vers le répertoire .minecraft
6. `Utils` = Contient des fonctions pour les versions du jeu, nom de variables et autre modification du .properties.
    
### Exporter votre installeur :

Avec Gradle rien de plus simple :
`Gradle > Task > Build > jar`

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""https://static.companyofcube.fr/youtube/webAssets/buildGradle.PNG"" alt=""Logo"" width=""350"" height=""400"">
</p>

Et l'installeur sera mis dans le dossier `build > libs`

### Convertir en .exe :

Pour convertir votre fichier .jar en .exe (et ainsi avoir une belle icône), vous devrez utiliser le logiciel [Launch4J](http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/)
Il existe beaucoup de tutoriel sur son utilisation sur internet :)

<!-- Possibilitées -->
## Possibilitées

Je n'ai pas la prétention d'être un bon développeur voir un développeur tout court, je m'en sort depuis des années en suivant beaucoup de vidéos et tutos sur internet.  
Je me suis donc permis de vous fournir une base qui n'est sûrement pas la plus optimisé ni la plus propre en code, mais au moins c'est fonctionnel.

Ce code est surtout très maléable, vous pouvez en faire ce que vous voulez !  

A titre d'exemple l'installeur de mon projet [CompanyofCube](https://companyofcube.fr/) à été crée à partir de cette base.

This is a rewrite of Ancient Warfare mod for Minecraft for Minecraft versions 1.12.x+.

Modules initially available will be:

* Core (mandatory for all sub-modules)  

* Automation -- adds quarries, automated farms, tree-farms, etc.  

* NPCs -- adds workers, combat npcs. Complete faction-based NPC system for world-gen.  

* Structures -- the AW template system, packaged as a stand-alone. Has dynamically loaded plugins to handle interaction with other AW modules.  

* Vehicles -- Adds vehicles for transportation and warfare.

Latest and historical releases can be [found on CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ancient-warfare-2/files).

Development unstable releases can be downloaded from Github packages.  
[Download mod builds](https://github.com/P3pp3rF1y/AncientWarfare2/packages/36069)

## Development

In order to develop on this project you will need to:  

1) Download the repository into a local folder.  

2) Locate this folder, run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` (or `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`). This sets up base minecraft and minecraftforge libraries and their dependencies.

3) Run `gradlew idea` or `gradlew eclipse` based on the IDE you use to setup project files.

At this point it should be completely setup to begin development.

![CraftMania](http://2dbrothers.comuf.com/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/craftmania/schermafbeelding-2012-02-25-om-12-01-25.png ""CraftMania"")

CraftMania is my open-source game. It is supposed to look like Minecraft by Mojang. I am trying to make the game as close as possible to Minecraft. 
Before I made my source public, I asked on [StackExchange](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/22247/am-i-allowed-to-make-my-minecraft-clone-open-source) if it is actually legal to do so. 
The answer was yes, as long as I don't use the name Minecraft and do not use any assets created by Mojang. So right now, all the source code 
is available at my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mcourteaux/CraftMania)! You can also visit the [blog](http://2dbrothers.comuf.com/wordpress)!

I started the game in Java from scratch using some code snippets by Benjamin Glatzel for the advanced mathematical techniques he used in his
game called [Terasology](http://blog.movingblocks.net/blockmania/). I'm using OpenGL through [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org/).


Setup
-----

You will need Oracle's [Java Virtual Machine (JVM)](http://www.java.com/de/download/). You should be sure that your Graphics Card (GPU) driver is up to date.
It is recommended to take a look at ""conf/conf.txt"" and set the values you think are the best for your machine.


Run the Game
------------

You can simply double click the CraftMania.jar file when you installed Oracle's JVM.

Controls
--------

 * [Z,Q,S,D] or [Q,W,A,S]	Walking. Choose your Keyboard layout in ""conf/conf.txt""
 * [Space] 					Jump.
 * [Left click]				Place the block in your hand.
 * [Right click]			Destroy the block on which you are aiming.
 * [F]						Toggle God-mode.
 * [E]						Open your inventory.
 * [O]						Toggle overlay rendering.
 * [L]						Place or remove a lightpoint (you should use torches, in fact :D)


Credits

Texture Pack
------------

I'm using the awesome <strong><a href=""http://www.carrotcakestudios.co.uk/gmcraft/"">Good Morning Craft!</a></strong> texture pack by Louis Durrant.
Of course, this is a texture pack developed for Minecraft by Mojang. So, you might try his texture pack for Minecraft. Make sure you take a look at it!

"
539,ddevault/Craft.Net,C#,"# Craft.Net

Craft.Net is a collection of several Minecraft-related .NET libraries. You can pick and choose different
libraries from Craft.Net to accomplish different tasks. The following libraries are included:

* *Craft.Net.AI*: Artificial intelligence for driving mob behavior (planned)
* **Craft.Net.Anvil**: Support for editing Minecraft Anvil worlds
  * Works with in-memory worlds or on-disk worlds
  * Can save worlds from Craft.Net.Client to disk
* **Craft.Net.Client**: A Minecraft multiplayer client library
  * Multiplayer client for connecting to servers
  * Utilities like LastLogin decryption, vanilla server list parsing/modification, etc
* **Craft.Net.Common**: Minecraft data types and common utilities
  * Defines values for biomes, difficulty, game modes, etc
  * Includes structs for working with item stacks, metadata dictionaries, etc
  * Cryptography support for interop with Minecraft's Java-based crypto
* **Craft.Net.Entities**: Structure and behavior of Minecraft entities
  * Includes players, items, blocks
* **Craft.Net.Logic**: Handles block and item interaction logic
  * Includes classes for all Minecraft blocks and items
  * Defines logic such as wheat growth, torch placement, etc
* **Craft.Net.Networking**: Generic Minecraft networking support
  * Includes all packet definitions
  * Includes AES/CFB stream crypto utilities
* **Craft.Net.Physics**: Simple physics engine that aims to recreate Minecraft phsyics
  * Support for AABB entities interacting with each other and Anvil worlds
* **Craft.Net.Server**: A Minecraft multiplayer server library
  * Includes entity management, physics
  * Many block interactions (such as growth, sand logic, etc) implemented
  * Survival mode, creative mode, adventure mode support
  * PvP combat
* **Craft.Net.TerrainGeneration**: Various terrain generators
  * Vanilla flatland support
  * Custom perlin-based terrain generator

More libraries are planned for the future. All libraries in Craft.Net support Windows, Linux, and Mac. The
long-term goal is to recreate the entire Minecraft ecosystem in C#, and to offer interopability with vanilla
Minecraft.

**A note on submodules**: Craft.Net includes external dependencies in the form of git submodules. When cloning
Craft.Net, please use `git clone --recursive git://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net.git`. If you've already cloned
it, you can fetch submodules manually with `git submodule update --init`.

The latest supported Minecraft version is **1.7.5**.

## Classic Support

There is work-in-progress support for Minecraft classic. The following libraries are available:

* **Craft.Net.Classic.Common**: Common utilities and classes for working with Minecraft Classic
* **Craft.Net.Classic.Networking**: Minecraft Classic networking support
  * Full support for Minecraft Classic networking protocol

Libraries like Craft.Net.Classic.Server, Craft.Net.Classic.Client, Craft.Net.Classic.Level, and more are also
planned.

## Community and Related Projects

There's an active Craft.Net development, discussion, and support community on IRC. Join us to chat at
[#craft.net on irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=craft.net&uio=d4). This is the best place
to ask questions. You can also let us know if you are doing anything cool with Craft.Net, like these related
projects:

* [PartyCraft](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/PartyCraft): Custom Minecraft server with plugin support
* [SMProxy](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/SMProxy): Proxy for Minecraft network protocol debugging and reverse engineering

## Snapshot Support

Craft.Net often supports Minecraft pre-release snapshots. If you want to try it out, look at the snapshot
branch. Run the following command to get snapshot support: `git pull origin snapshot && git checkout snapshot`

This branch has bleeding-edge support for the upcoming version of Minecraft.

## HTTPS Certificates on Mono

Mono does not trust any certificates whatsoever after install, and you need to tell it which ones to trust.
This means that Craft.Net.Client will fail to log into minecraft.net when connecting to online-mode servers.
The easiest way to fix this is to just trust all the Mozilla root certificates by running
`mozroots --import --sync`.

## Usage

Craft.Net is a very large, expansive project. A basic overview will be given here, but you are encouraged to
[visit the wiki](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Craft.Net/wiki) to learn more about specific sub-projects.

### Generic Networking

You can use Craft.Net.Networking to work with the Minecraft network protocol. Craft.Net.Networking depends on
Craft.Net.Data to describe Minecraft data types. To use it, create a MinecraftStream around a NetworkStream,
and then you can use the `PacketReader` class to read packets from the stream. Craft.Net.Networking also
includes an AES/CFB stream that you can wrap your NetworkStream in to encrypt it.

### Servers

Here's an example of using Craft.Net.Server to run a Minecraft server:

```csharp
var server = new MinecraftServer(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, 25565));
var generator = new FlatlandGenerator();
// Creates a level in the ""world"" directory, using the flatland generator
// You may omit ""world"" to create a level in memory.
minecraftServer.AddLevel(new Level(generator, ""world""));
minecraftServer.Start();
```

### Clients

Here's an example of connecting to a Minecraft server with Craft.Net.Client:

```csharp
var session = new Session(""PlayerName"");
// Uncomment this code to use the user's saved lastlogin instead
//var lastLogin = LastLogin.GetLastLogin();
//var session = Session.DoLogin(lastLogin.Username, lastLogin.Password);
var client = new MinecraftClient(session);
// Connect to the server at 127.0.0.1:25565
client.Connect(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 25565));
// Alternative:
//client.Connect(""server.address.here:25565"");
```

Session.DoLogin can be used to authenticate with minecraft.net for online-mode servers. This code also
includes a (commented out) example of decrypting the user's LastLogin file.

### World Editing

You can use Craft.Net.World do manipulate Minecraft save data. You can also add a reference to Craft.Net.Logic
to get some nice extension methods that let you work with blocks by name
(ex. `world.SetBlock(Coordinates3D.Zero, new BedrockBlock())`). Here's an example of loading a world:

```csharp
var level = Level.LoadFrom(""world"");
level.DefaultWorld.SetBlockId(Coordinates3D.Zero, 22); // Set to lapis block
level.Save();
```

If Craft.Net supports the terrain generator the level.dat file specifies, it will automatically generate
chunks when attempting to work with blocks in an ungenerated area. You can also explicitly set the terrain
generator from the constructor. You may add support for your own generators by implementing IWorldGenerator.

## Building from source

On Windows, add ""C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319"" to your path. Then, run this from the root
of the repository:

    msbuild

On Linux and Mac, install Mono 2.10 or better, and then use this command:

    xbuild

You can also build Craft.Net with Visual Studio 2010 or newer, and any version of MonoDevelop or SharpDevelop.

=================

This is a Minecraft mod, originally from November 2012. Based on copygirl's external tool NBTEdit, In-Game NBTEdit allows users to edit NBT tags of entities and tiles while in-game.

The code is fairly messy - I would recommend porting this to GuiLib, but that is easier said than done.

544,hoeghh/k8s-minecraft,Mustache,"# Run on Docker host

First create a directory with read/write acces for a user with uid 1000.
This is usually yourself. Find the use account with uid 1000 by running :

```
id 1000
```

Now start Minecraft witht he following command
```
# Get current username, if this has uid 1000.
# If not, then replace with the username that has.
user=$(whoami)

# Create a folder in current users home folder for persistance
mkdir /home/$user/minecraft-server

# Start minecraft
# 1. Accept the eula
# 2. Map minecraft port to host
# 4. Mount volume in container for persistance
# 5. name of the docker image to use

docker run -d     \
  -e EULA=true    \
  -p 25565:25565  \
  -v /home/$user/minecraft-server:/minecraft-data/ \
  --name minecraft \
  hoeghh/minecraft:1.12.2
```

# Running in Kubernetes
You need a Kubernetes cluster and Helm installed

Edit the PV file minecraft.pv.yaml to point to your nfs share.
Then apply the PV and PVC, and then helm install minecraft.

```
kubectl apply -f minecraft.pv.yaml
kubectl apply -f minecraft.pvc.yaml
cd helmchart/k8s-minecraft/
helm install . --name overworld
```

As for now, proxy the pod to your host
```
kubectl port-forward overworld-k8s-minecraft-0 25565:25565 
```

# Connecting Minecraft client to our server
Start minecraft, and create a new server connection. Set the location to localhost and save. 

Later i will use an Ingress Controller for Kubernetes to expose it outside the cluster

# A sample world
I have added a sample world with a small house and some kubernetes paintings. Just unzip it and place it in the volume.

# Infrared - a Minecraft Proxy

An ultra lightweight Minecraft reverse proxy and idle placeholder:
Ever wanted to have only one exposed port on your server for multiple Minecraft servers?
Then Infrared is the tool you need!
Infrared works as a reverse proxy using a subdomain to connect clients to a specific Minecraft server.
It works similar to Nginx for those of you who are familiar. 

## Features

- [x] Reverse Proxy
- [x] Display Placeholder Server
- [x] Autostart Server when pinged
- [x] Logger Callback URLs
- [x] HAProxy Protocol Support
- [x] TCPShield/RealIP Protocol Support
- [X] Prometheus Support
- [X] REST API

## Deploy

```shell script
$ docker build --no-cache -t haveachin/infrared:latest https://github.com/haveachin/infrared.git &&
  docker image prune -f --filter label=stage=intermediate &&
  docker run -d --name infrared --restart=unless-stopped -it -v /usr/local/infrared/configs/:/configs -p 25565:25565/tcp --expose 25565 haveachin/infrared:latest
```

## Update

```shell script
$ docker build --no-cache -t haveachin/infrared:latest https://github.com/haveachin/infrared.git &&
  docker image prune -f --filter label=stage=intermediate &&
  docker stop infrared &&
  docker rm infrared &&
  docker run -d --name infrared --restart=unless-stopped -it -v /usr/local/infrared/configs/:/configs -p 25565:25565/tcp --expose 25565 haveachin/infrared:latest
```

## Rest API

**The API should not be accessible from the internet!**

### Enabling API

To enable the API the environment variable `INFRARED_API_ENABLED` must be set to `""true""`. To change the http bind, set
the env variable `INFRARED_API_BIND` to something like `""0.0.0.0:3000""` the default value is `""127.0.0.1:8080""`

### API Methods

#### Create new config

POST `/proxies`\
Body must contain:
```json
{
""domainName"": ""mc.example.com"",
""proxyTo"": "":8080""
}
```
But all values (like in a normal config file) can be set.

The API then will create a file with the name of the domain (if the file exists it will be overwritten) and write the body to it. The proxy can now be visited.

-----
POST `/proxies/{fileName}`\
Body must contain:
```json
{
""domainName"": ""mc.example.com"",
""proxyTo"": "":8080""
}
```
But all values (like in a normal config file) can be set.

The server will create a file with the given filename (if the file exists it will be overwritten) and store the config in it.


### Remove config
DELETE `/proxies/{fileName}`\
Replace `:file` with the name of the proxy configuration file.

If the file was found it will be unloaded and deleted. Open connections do not close, but no new player can connect anymore.

## Prometheus exporter
The built-in prometheus exporter can be used to view metrics about infrareds operation.  
When the command line flag `-enable-prometheus` is enabled it will bind to `:9100` by default, if you would like to use another port or use an application like [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) that also uses port 9100 on the same machine you can change the port with the `-prometheus-bind` command line flag, example: `-prometheus-bind="":9070""`.  
It is recommended to firewall the prometheus exporter with an application like *ufw* or *iptables* to make it only accessible by your own Prometheus instance.
### Prometheus configuration:
Example prometheus.yml configuration:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: infrared
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['infrared-exporter-hostname:port']
```

### Metrics:
* infrared_connected: show the amount of connected players per instance and proxy:
  * **Example response:** `infrared_connected{host=""proxy.example.com"",instance=""vps1.example.com:9070"",job=""infrared""} 10`
  * **host:** listenTo domain as specified in the infrared configuration.
  * **instance:** what infrared instance the amount of players are connected to.
  * **job:** what job was specified in the prometheus configuration.
* infrared_proxies: show the amount of active infrared proxies:
  * **Example response:** `infrared_proxies{instance=""vps1.example.com:9070"",job=""infrared""} 5`
  * **instance:** what infrared instance has that amount of active proxies.
  * **job:** what job was specified in the prometheus configuration.

Genisys is one of several derived projects resulting from the inactivity of **[PocketMine/PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP)**. It has many gameplay features implemented which PocketMine-MP does not since Minecraft PE v0.11.
However, this project has been abandoned by most of its active developers, and the project quality has been lowered by too many people touching code without understanding side effects.

Genisys is now no longer under active development due to its remaining developers do not wish to continue working with its mess, and it is now for the most part maintenance-only. 
If you wish to continue using Genisys, you may continue to do so, but its maintenance now primarily consists of cherry-picking from its re-activated parent project, **[pmmp/PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)**, and its stability leaves a lot to be desired. 
We recommend you move to **[pmmp/PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)** as soon as you feel comfortable doing so. This project will cease to be maintained once PocketMine-MP overtakes it.

## About Minecraft U

<img src=""mcu1.png"" style=""max-width:250px;float:right"">

### Practical Programming and Design Instruction for Your Child

Minecraft game mechanics are incredibly analogous to engineering. We focus on teaching problem solving and programming techniques in a safe, encouraging ecosystem centered around Minecraft.

Our curriculum is designed to guide a child from the basics of Minecraft gameplay all the way through to programming using modern programming languages. Our materials are engaging and skip the cruft of most books or templated materials. Maintaining it ourselves means we are able to keep it updated to the changing landscape of both Minecraft and technology education.

The curriculum itself is organized into a core curriculum organized by levels. There are also additional units outside of the core levels.

### Level 1: Basic Computer Skills with Minecraft | [source](https://github.com/MinecraftU/mcu-curriculum/tree/master/level_1)

Learn how to use a computer...no previous experience required! You might be able to make an iPad sing, but it's time to learn how to use a keyboard and mouse. You also might be brand-new to Minecraft or need to level up your Minecraft skills from the Pocket Edition to the ""proper"" PC version.

### Level 2: Basic Problem Solving with Minecraft | [source](https://github.com/MinecraftU/mcu-curriculum/tree/master/level_2)

Learn the basics of survival in the Minecraft world, from fending off starvation to defending against skeletons. Overcome the challenges that Minecraft has to offer, and have fun doing it. _For ages 6-12._

### Level 3: Engineering with Redstone | [source](https://github.com/MinecraftU/mcu-curriculum/tree/master/level_3)

Learn the basics of electricity and logic, with in-game and real-world applications. We’ll go over digital circuits, like those found in smartphones and tablets, and how to use them in the Minecraft world to build some awesome contraptions. _For ages 8-14 or younger when having completed Level 2 or with equivalent experience._

### Level 4: ComputerCraft | [source](https://github.com/MinecraftU/mcu-curriculum/tree/master/level_4)

Use the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft to learn the basics of programming and then apply those skills via your own in-game robots. These robots can do anything, from build you a house to find and mine diamonds for you. The only limit is your ability to direct them. _For ages 8-14 or younger when having completed Level 3 or with equivalent experience._

### Level 5: Java and Modding Minecraft | [source](https://github.com/MinecraftU/mcu-curriculum/tree/master/level_5)

Learn the basics of Java, the most common programming language in the world, and use them to create your own modification of Minecraft. Add any item of your design to the game, expanding Minecraft in whatever direction you desire. _For ages 10-16 or younger when having completed Level 4 or with equivalent experience._

### Level 6: Independent Study in Programming and Software Development

Expand your Java modding abilities, or learn a new language and build websites. We'll point you in the right direction, provide the material, and help you along the way.

### Level 7: Brainstorming with Minecraft | [source](https://github.com/MinecraftU/mcu-curriculum/tree/master/level_7)

Brainstorming with Minecraft is all about how to create ideas and put them to work with technology. We will use Minecraft as our brainstorming playground because it is friendly and easy to use, but still sophisticated enough to use as an exploratory launching pad for these concepts. Over the course of the camp, students will learn about worldbuilding, product design and work management. Students will practice a design sprint, prototyping, user testing, iteration, and Kanban—all tools and methods that real software teams use to create the products you use every day.

## How To (Server Admins)
Tuinity uses the same paperclip jar system that Paper uses.

You can download the latest build (1.17.x) of Tuinity by going [here](https://ci.codemc.io/job/Spottedleaf/job/Tuinity-1.17/)

You can also [build it yourself](https://github.com/Tuinity/Tuinity#building).

## How To (Plugin developers)
In order to use Tuinity as a dependency you must [build it yourself](https://github.com/Tuinity/Tuinity#building).
Each time you want to update your dependency you must re-build Tuinity.

Tuinity-API maven dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.tuinity</groupId>
    <artifactId>tuinity-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.17.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
 </dependency>
 ```

Tuinity-Server maven dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.tuinity</groupId>
    <artifactId>tuinity</artifactId>
    <version>1.17.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Building

Requirements:
- You need `git` installed, with a configured user name and email. 
   On Windows you need to run from git bash.
- You need `maven` installed.
- You need `jdk` 16+ installed to compile (and `jre` 16+ to run).
- Anything else that `paper` requires to build.

To set up the `Tuinity-API` and `Tuinity-Server` repo to begin editing/reading source code, 
clone the Tuinity repo and run `gradlew applypatches` from the root directory.

To build Tuinity, run the following commands in the root directory after cloning the 
Tuinity repo:
1. `gradlew applypatches`
2. `gradlew build`
3. `gradlew paperclipjar`

Once all 3 steps complete successfully, `tuinity-paperclip.jar` will be placed into
the project root directory

#### Creating a patch
Patches are effectively just commits in either `Tuinity-API` or `Tuinity-Server`.
To create one, just add a commit to either repo and run `./gradlew rebuildpatches`, and a
patch will be placed in the patches folder. Modifying commits will also modify its
corresponding patch file.

## License
The PATCHES-LICENSE file describes the license for api & server patches,
found in `./patches` and its subdirectories except when noted otherwise.

The fork is based off of PaperMC's fork example found [here](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight-examples).
As such, it contains modifications to it in this project, please see the repository for license information
of modified files."

[Minecraft Server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/)

**Description**

Minecraft is a sandbox video game created by Swedish game developer Markus Persson and released by Mojang in 2011. The game allows players to build with a variety of different blocks in a 3D procedurally generated world, requiring creativity from players. Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat. Multiple game modes that change gameplay are available, including—but not limited to—a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources to build with.

**Build notes**

Latest stable Minecraft Java release from Mojang.

**Usage**
```
docker run -d \
    -p <host port>:8222/tcp \
    -p <host port>:25565 \

If this does not work please open a ticket with the specific issues you have.

### Developers
##### Please do PR's to the Development branch NOT Master
- Built using Intellij and Java 11
- Runs on Java 8 (1.8)
- Using Gradle to build the project. I created a custom task called buildAll which
builds everything from .JAR, .EXE, .ZIP, and .TAR
- If you have a feature to add create a pull request! Help is always nice.

#### Gradle Build Instructions (any OS)

The [`Gradle` wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) was built using `Gradle 6.7`.
The [latest version of Gradle is recommended](https://gradle.org/install/), as older versions may throw errors, such as:


```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
'org.gradle.api.Task org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskContainer.create(java.lang.String, java.lang.Class, java.lang.Object[])'

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output. Run with --scan to get full insights.

* Get more help at https://help.gradle.org
```

Note, package managers such as `apt` might not have the latest Gradle version available.
You can choose to use either your system's Gradle installation or the local Gradle wrapper for the build (replace the `gradle` commands below with `./gradlew` or `gradlew.bat`).
The Gradle wrapper is provided to allow developers to get up and running quickly without having to have a system installation of Gradle.

From the project root, run:

```bash
# build the project
gradle build

# run Sassa
gradle run
```

### Content Creators

If you are a content creator and would like to make a video and showcase the tool please feel free.
Just some information regarding about myself and the plans of the tool.

- Its pronounced Zods - mar (Zodz - mar)
- I am a guy so saying *he* is totally fine.

As for future plans please check out the projects page where I am trying to keep up to date with what
I am working on also future plans and ideas. (Nothing is set in stone but there are the plans).

Also if you are going to make a video or content in anyway, I am always looking for developers who
are interested in helping or people who might know different methods of doing the searching and can help
improve things like stability, reliability, etc. So any form of shoutout, kinda of like a reminder to anyone
who is technically inclined would be a great help!

Ecology Mod is a Minecraft mod that makes you care about consequences of your technical development.

The mod adds an environmental pollution system: pollution sources and effects.

Tile Entities and mechanics from Minecraft produces pollution which accumulates in chunks and diffuses to the neighbours.

Pollution Sources, for example, are:

* Furnace
* Open fire
* Explosions
* Rubbish (Dropped items)
* etc.

As the pollution accumulates in the chunks, it triggers various pollution effects, such as:

* Smog (a thick poisonous fog)
* Food Pollution (food poisoned by the pollution)
* Extinction of Animals/Fish
* Death of trees
* Acid Rain
* etc.

The full list of pollution effects and further information about them can be found [on the mod wiki page about pollution effects](https://github.com/Artem226/MinecraftEcologyMod/wiki/Pollution-Effects).

Pollution also can be reduced by _negative_ pollution sources, such as:

* Tree Growing
* Tree Leaves

**Further information about the mod's main mechanic as well as the sources list can be found on the wiki:**
[How it works?(wiki)](https://github.com/Artem226/MinecraftEcologyMod/wiki)

To access and deal with the environmental pollution the mod provides some blocks and items:

* Pollution Filter, which reduces nearby blocks pollution emissions (using RF/Forge energy).
* Advanced Filter, which reduces the chunk pollution (also using RF/Forge energy)
* Analyzer, which retrieves information about the chunk pollution and active pollution effects in the chunk.
* Respirator, which is used to filtrate the air, the player breathe, thus protecting him from air pollution effects.

[Recipes and further information about blocks/items (wiki)](https://github.com/Artem226/MinecraftEcologyMod/wiki/Blocks,-Items,-Recipes)

To make the mod more flexible there are some console commands in the mod.

[Console Commands(wiki)](https://github.com/Artem226/MinecraftEcologyMod/wiki/Console-Commands)

At the moment the mod is translated to the following languages:

1. English
2. Russian
3. Chinese

TabooLib 是为 Minecraft（Java 版）提供一个跨平台的插件开发框架。但是 TabooLib
不是一个平台，也不提供插件的运行环境，而是帮助开发者在各个平台上快速开发，代替一些频繁使用或是相对复杂的操作，以及解决一些令人头疼的问题。

+ TabooLib 起初是针对 Bukkit 的解决方案，不过现在正在横向发展。
+ 我们使用 MIT 协议，这个协议非常的宽松。
+ 开发速度至上。

随着 6.0 版本的更新，我们更加注重安全性和稳定性。抛弃了上个版本问题频发的热加载机制，虽然那样能够显著的减少插件体积，以及带来一个中心化的插件管理器。但是随着
Minecraft 的版本更新，以及大量的第三方 Spigot 分支出现，这样的设计出现了不少问题。所以迎来 6.0
版本的巨大更新是铁板钉钉的事情，也是在这个版本我们重新精心设计了 TabooLib 的每一个工具。

大多数基于 TabooLib 的插件应能跨多个 Minecraft 版本使用而不用特别更新。即在大部分情况下，服主不需要担心插件不兼容的问题。甚至是大面积使用
nms 代码也不例外，TabooLib 提供了数个堪比魔法的工具。

**简单一点的，例如你可以按照 TabooLib 提供的方法快速注册命令。**

```kotlin
command(""tp"") {
    literal(""random"") {
        execute<ProxyPlayer> { sender, _, _ ->
            sender.teleport(sender.entities().randomOrNull() ?: return@execute)
        }
    }
    player {
        execute<ProxyPlayer> { sender, ctx, _ ->
            sender.teleport(ctx.player())
        }
    }
    execute<ProxyPlayer> { sender, _, _ ->
        sender.teleport(sender.entityNearly() ?: return@execute)
    }
}
```

复杂一点的就像下面这样自行搭建多平台实现，TabooLib 会根据当前运行平台选择相应的实现类。

```kotlin
import org.bukkit.Bukkit
import org.bukkit.entity.Player
import taboolib.common.platform.*
import taboolib.platform.util.toBukkitLocation
import java.util.*

interface PlatformEntityHandler {

    fun entities(player: ProxyPlayer): List<UUID>

    fun entityNearly(player: ProxyPlayer): UUID?

    fun teleport(player: ProxyPlayer, uuid: UUID)

    @PlatformImplementation(Platform.BUKKIT)
    class BukkitSide : PlatformEntityHandler {

        override fun entities(player: ProxyPlayer): List<UUID> {
            return player.cast<Player>().world.entities.map { it.uniqueId }
        }

        override fun entityNearly(player: ProxyPlayer): UUID? {
            return player.cast<Player>().world.entities
                .filter { it != player.origin }
                .minByOrNull { it.location.distance(player.location.toBukkitLocation()) }?.uniqueId
        }

        override fun teleport(player: ProxyPlayer, uuid: UUID) {
            player.cast<Player>().teleport(Bukkit.getEntity(uuid) ?: return)
        }
    }
}

fun ProxyPlayer.entities(): List<UUID> {
    return implementations<PlatformEntityHandler>().entities(this)
}

fun ProxyPlayer.entityNearly(): UUID? {
    return implementations<PlatformEntityHandler>().entityNearly(this)
}

fun ProxyPlayer.teleport(uuid: UUID) {
    implementations<PlatformEntityHandler>().teleport(this, uuid)
}
```

如果你的插件仅在 Bukkit 平台上工作，那么大可不必这么做。因为 TabooLib 的职责是帮助开发者们尽可能快速的完成开发工作，而不是制造一些无意义的方法来增加仓库体积。

### Included:

- Basic Launch Model (LauncherCore, LaunchOptions, ...)
- Authentication Model (Yggdrasil, Offline, ...)
- Java & System Information Finder
- Zip Module using .Net Internal API ( MS.Internal.IO.Zip.* )
- Basic VersionLocator (JVersion)
- A set of useful extensions
- A launch reporter that can be disabled
- Custom authentication server

## KMCCC.Basic

Basic Version of KMCCC

- No more

## KMCCC.Pro

Professional Version of KMCCC

### Included:

- Everything in KMCCC.Shared
- Mojang API
- [WIP] Game File Download & Fix & Check (Including Version, Library, Native&Assets)
- [WIP] More useful extensions for LaunchHandle
- [WIP] More useful libraries that a launch might need.

## Plan

We plan to delay some parameter settings, (such as versionLocator) and make more features available in KMCCC.Pro

# Sample

## How to initialize a LauncherCore

```csharp

LauncherCore core = LauncherCore.Create(
	new LauncherCoreCreationOption(
		javaPath: Config.Instance.JavaPath, // by default it will be the first version finded
		gameRootPath: null, // by defualt it will be ./.minecraft/
		versionLocator: the Version Locator // by default it will be new JVersionLocator()
	));

```

## How to find Versions

```csharp

var versions = core.GetVersions();

var version = core.GetVersion(""1.8"");

```

*unlaunchable Version will be ignored*

## How to launch Minecraft


```csharp
var result = core.Launch(new LaunchOptions
{
	Version = App.LauncherCore.GetVersion(server.VersionId)
	Authenticator = new OfflineAuthenticator(""Steve""), // offline
	//Authenticator = new YggdrasilLogin(""*@*.*"", ""***"", true), // online
	MaxMemory = Config.Instance.MaxMemory, // optional
	MinMemory = Config.Instance.MaxMemory, // optional
	Mode = LaunchMode.MCLauncher, // optional
	Server = new ServerInfo {Address = ""mc.hypixel.net""}, //optional
	Size = new WindowSize {Height = 768, Width = 1280} //optional
}, (Action<MinecraftLaunchArguments>) (x => { })); // optional ( modify arguments before launching
```

## Using anonymous report ##

```csharp
Reporter.SetClientName(""Your launcher's name""); // set name
Reporter.SetReportLevel(ReportLevel.Full); // full report
//Reporter.SetReportLevel(ReportLevel.Basic); // basic report
//Reporter.SetReportLevel(ReportLevel.Min); // simplified report
//Reporter.SetReportLevel(ReportLevel.None); // turn off
```

## Contributing

Any changes to the schemas are to be done through the source files in the folder source. These get converted and compressed through an action into
smaller schemas. On other matters follow the [Contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This project could use help in filling in descriptions, titles and giving snippets!

JSON validation can give snippets for sub items, as well as description, but this hasn't always been filled out!

## Manual Usage

### Vscode

- Copy the `vscode-settings.json` file into the `.vscode` folder in your project and rename it to: `settings.json`  
  OR
- Copy the contents of `vscode-settings.json` into your `.code-workspace` file under the property settings:

```JSON
{
  ""folders"": [ { ""path"": ""."" } ],
  ""settings"": {
    ""json.schemas"": [

## Sample

If you want to learn more features of this library such as to download java runtime or launch with more detailed options, go to wiki

**[Simple Sample Code](https://github.com/AlphaBs/MinecraftLauncherLibrary/wiki/Sample-Code)**  

**[Sample Launcher (CmlLibSample)](https://github.com/AlphaBs/MinecraftLauncherLibrary/releases)**  
Download CmlLibSample.zip file, unzip file and execute CmlLibSample.exe

**[CmlLibSample Source Code](https://github.com/AlphaBs/MinecraftLauncherLibrary/tree/master/CmlLibSample)** 

## Build

#### Build CmlLib

1. download source codes  
2. Build CmlLib project. if an error occurs, restore nuget package of CmlLib project. (Package name : Newtonsoft.Json, DotNetZip)  

Required dll : **Newtonsoft.Json.dll, DotNetZip.dll, CmlLib.dll**

#### Build CmlLibSample (Sample launcher)

1. Add reference above, 'Newtonsoft.Json.dll, DotNetZip.dll, CmlLib.dll'.  
2. Build CmlLibSample project.

#### Pre-built library

**[Nuget package : CustomMinecraftLauncher](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CustomMinecraftLauncher/)**  
or go to Release tab

## How to use

Enter the source code in the order shown below.

### **1. Prepare**

Install Nuget Package 'CustomMinecraftLauncher'  
or download dll files in Release tab (CmlLib.dll, Newtonsoft.Json.dll, DotNetZip.dll) and add reference

write this on the top of your source code:  


      using CmlLib.Launcher;

### **2. Minecraft Initialize**

You should write this code before work.

      Minecraft.Initialize(""GAME_DIRECTORY"");

It set Game Directory that is used to download game files, load profiles, save login session, Launch, etc...  
**You can't use relative path.**

### **3. Login**

     MLogin login = new MLogin();
     MSession session = null;

     session = login.TryAutoLogin();
     if (session.Result != MLoginResult.Success)
     {
          session = login.Authenticate(
               ""YOUR_MOJANG_EMAIL"",
               ""PASSWORD"");

          if (session.result != MLoginResult.Success)
               throw new Exception(""Failed login : "" + session.result.ToString());
     }

     Console.WriteLine(""Hello, "" + session.Username);

The 'session' is login result.
note : you can't use old login using username instead of mojang email.

or you can use offline session :

     MSession session = MSession.GetOfflineSession(""USERNAME"");

### **4. Get Profile Infos**

Profile contain various data which launcher need.
All Game Versions has its own profile, even old alpha version and forge.
You can find it at (GameDirectory)￦versions￦(any-version)￦(version-name).json.
MProfileInfo is metadata of profile, containing Name, Profile Path(Url), Type(Release, Snapshot, Old), ReleaseTime.
and this code get profile info :

     MProfileInfo[] infos = MProfileInfo.GetProfiles();

It will return all metadata from mojang web server and your game directory.  
but you can choose source :

     // get profiles from mojang server
     var web = MProfileInfo.GetProfilesFromWeb();
     // get profiles from game directory
     var local = MProfileInfo.GetProfilesFromLocal();

### **5. Choose ProfileInfo and Parse**

In order to use profile data, you should parse profile.  
This simple code will search version from metadatas, and return parsed profile data.

     MProfile profile = MProfile.FindProfile(infos, ""1.14.4"");

### **6. Check & Download Game Files**

     MDownloader downloader = new MDownloader(profile);
     downloader.ChangeFile += change_file;
     downloader.ChangeProgress += change_progress;
     downloader.DownloadAll();

and the handler methods of ChangeFile and ChangeProgress event is :

     private void Downloader_ChangeProgress(object sender, System.ComponentModel.ProgressChangedEventArgs e)
     {
         // when download file was changed
         // 20%, 30%, 80%, ...
         Console.WriteLine(""{0}%"", e.ProgressPercentage);
     }
 
     private void Downloader_ChangeFile(DownloadFileChangedEventArgs e)
     {
         // when the progress of current downloading file was changed
         // [Library] hi.jar - 3/51
         Console.WriteLine(""[{0}] {1} - {2}/{3}"", e.FileKind.ToString(), e.FileName, e.ProgressedFileCount, e.TotalFileCount);
     }

DownloadAll() method check the existence of game file, and download game file from mojang server if file is not exist or not valid(compare hash).  

### **7. Make game args and Launch**

     var option = new MLaunchOption()
     {
          // must require
          StartProfile = profile,
          JavaPath = ""java.exe"", //SET YOUR JAVA PATH (if you want autoset, goto wiki)
          MaximumRamMb = 1024, // MB
          Session = session,
          
          // not require
          ServerIP = """", // connect server directly
          LauncherName = """", // display launcher name at main window
          CustomJavaParameter = """" // set your own java args
     };
     
     var launch = new MLaunch(option);
     var process = launch.GetProcess();
     process.Start();

set launch options, and launch it!

570,aadnk/ProtocolLib,Java,"# ProtocolLib

Certain tasks are impossible to perform with the standard Bukkit API, and may require
working with and even modifying Minecraft directly. A common technique is to modify incoming
and outgoing [packets](https://www.wiki.vg/Protocol), or inject custom packets into the
stream. This is quite cumbersome to do, however, and most implementations will break
as soon as a new version of Minecraft has been released, mostly due to obfuscation.

Critically, different plugins that use this approach may _hook_ into the same classes,
with unpredictable outcomes. More than often this causes plugins to crash, but it may also
lead to more subtle bugs.

Currently maintained by dmulloy2 on behalf of [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/).

### Resources

* [Resource Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/)
* [Dev Builds](https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib)
* [JavaDoc](https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/javadoc/index.html)

### Compilation

ProtocolLib is built with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). If you have it installed, just run
`mvn package` in the root project folder.

### A new API

__ProtocolLib__ attempts to solve this problem by providing an event API, much like Bukkit,
that allows plugins to monitor, modify, or cancel packets sent and received. But, more importantly,
the API also hides all the gritty, obfuscated classes with a simple index based read/write system.
You no longer have to reference CraftBukkit!

### Using ProtocolLib

To use this library, first add ProtocolLib.jar to your Java build path. Then, add ProtocolLib
as a dependency or soft dependency to your plugin.yml file like any other plugin:

````yml
depend: [ ProtocolLib ]
````

You can also add ProtocolLib as a Maven dependency:

````xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>dmulloy2-repo</id>
    <url>https://repo.dmulloy2.net/repository/public/</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.comphenix.protocol</groupId>
    <artifactId>ProtocolLib</artifactId>
    <version>4.7.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
````

Or use the maven dependency with gradle:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url ""https://repo.dmulloy2.net/repository/public/"" }
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly group: ""com.comphenix.protocol"", name: ""ProtocolLib"", version: ""4.7.0"";
}
```

Then get a reference to ProtocolManager in onLoad() or onEnable() and you're good to go.

````java
private ProtocolManager protocolManager;

public void onLoad() {
    protocolManager = ProtocolLibrary.getProtocolManager();
}
````

To listen for packets sent by the server to a client, add a server-side listener:

````java
// Disable all sound effects
protocolManager.addPacketListener(new PacketAdapter(
    this,
    ListenerPriority.NORMAL,
    PacketType.Play.Server.NAMED_SOUND_EFFECT
) {
    @Override
    public void onPacketSending(PacketEvent event) {
        event.setCancelled(true);
    }
});
````

It's also possible to read and modify the content of these packets. For instance, you can create a global
censor by listening for Packet3Chat events:

````java
// Censor
protocolManager.addPacketListener(new PacketAdapter(
    this,
    ListenerPriority.NORMAL,
    PacketType.Play.Client.CHAT
) {
    @Override
    public void onPacketReceiving(PacketEvent event) {
        PacketContainer packet = event.getPacket();
        String message = packet.getStrings().read(0);

        if (message.contains(""shit"") || message.contains(""damn"")) {
            event.setCancelled(true);
            event.getPlayer().sendMessage(""Bad manners!"");
        }
    }
});
````

### Sending packets

Normally, you might have to do something ugly like the following:

````java
PacketPlayOutExplosion fakeExplosion = new PacketPlayOutExplosion(
    player.getLocation().getX(),
    player.getLocation().getY(),
    player.getLocation().getZ(),
    3.0F,
    new ArrayList<>(),
    new Vec3D(
        player.getVelocity().getX() + 1,
        player.getVelocity().getY() + 1,
        player.getVelocity().getZ() + 1
    )
);

((CraftPlayer) player).getHandle().b.a(fakeExplosion);
````

But with ProtocolLib, you can turn that into something more manageable:

````java
PacketContainer fakeExplosion = new PacketContainer(PacketType.Play.Server.EXPLOSION);
fakeExplosion.getDoubles()
    .write(0, player.getLocation().getX())
    .write(1, player.getLocation().getY())
    .write(2, player.getLocation().getZ());
fakeExplosion.getFloat().write(0, 3.0F);
fakeExplosion.getBlockPositionCollectionModifier().write(0, new ArrayList<>());
fakeExplosion.getVectors().write(0, player.getVelocity().add(new Vector(1, 1, 1)));

protocolManager.sendServerPacket(player, fakeExplosion);
````

### Compatibility

One of the main goals of this project was to achieve maximum compatibility with CraftBukkit. And the end
result is quite flexible. It's likely that I won't have to update ProtocolLib for anything but bug fixes
and new features.

How is this possible? It all comes down to reflection in the end. Essentially, no name is hard coded -
every field, method and class is deduced by looking at field types, package names or parameter
types. It's remarkably consistent across different versions.

### Reporting an issue

Please open an issue for a bug report only if:

* you are sure the bug is caused by BuildCraft and not by any other mod,
* you have at least one of the following:
  * a crash report, 
  * means of reproducing the bug in question,
  * screenshots/videos/etc. to demonstrate the bug.

**If you are not sure if a bug report is valid, please use the ""Ask Help!"" subforum.**

Please only use **official BuildCraft releases** for any kind of bug reports unless otherwise told to do by the BuildCraft team. Custom builds (for instance from Jenkins) are unsupported, often buggy and will **not** get any support from the developers.

Please check if the bug has been reported beforehand. Also, provide the version of BuildCraft used - if it's a version compiled from source, link to the commit/tree you complied from.

Please mention if you are using MCPC+, Cauldron, OptiFine, FastCraft or any other mods which optimize or otherwise severely modify the functioning of the Minecraft engine. That is very helpful when trying to reproduce a bug.

Please do not open issues for features unless you are a member of the BuildCraft team. For that, use the ""Feature Requests"" subforum.

BuildCraft, being an open-source project, gives you the right to submit a pull request if a particular fix or feature is important to you. However, if the change in question is major, please contact the team beforehand - we wish to prevent wasted effort.

### Contributing

If you wish to submit a pull request to fix bugs or broken behaviour feel free to do so. If you would like to add 
features or change existing behaviour or balance, please discuss it on discord before submitting a PR (https://discord.gg/v4geqgA).

Do not submit pull requests which solely ""fix"" formatting. As these kinds of changes are usually very intrusive in commit history and everyone has their own idea what ""proper formatting"" is, they should be done by one of the main contributors. 
Please only submit ""code cleanup"", if the changes actually have a substantial impact on readability.

PR implementing new features or changing large portions of code are helpful. But if you're doing such a change and if it gets accepted, please don't ""fire and forget"". Complex changes are introducing bugs, and as thorough as testing and peer review may be, there will be bugs. Please carry on playing your changes after initial commit and fix residual issues. It is extremely frustrating for others to spend days fixing regressions introduced by unmaintained submissions.

#### Frequently reported

* java.lang.AbstractMethodError, java.lang.NoSuchMethodException
  * A mod has not updated to the current BuildCraft API
  * You are not using the correct version of BuildCraft for your Forge/Minecraft versions
  * You are using the dev version on a normal game instance (or vice versa)
* Render issue (Quarry causes flickering) - Try without OptiFine first! This is a known issue with some versions of OptiFine.

### Compiling and packaging BuildCraft
1. Ensure that `Java` (found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)), `Git` (found [here](http://git-scm.com/)) are installed correctly on your system.
 * Optional: Install `Gradle` (found [here](http://www.gradle.org/downloads)). You probably want to install version 4.3.1.
2. Create a base directory for the build
3. Clone the BuildCraft repository into 'baseDir/BuildCraft/'
4. Clone (and update) the submodules into 'baseDir/BuildCraft with 'git submodule init' and 'git submodule update'
5. Navigate to basedir/BuildCraft in a shell and run one of two commands:
    * `./gradlew setupCIWorkspace build` to just build a current jar (this may take a while).
    * `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` to setup a complete development environment.
    * With `Gradle` installed: use `gradle` instead of `./gradlew`
    * On Windows: use `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`
6. The compiles and obfuscated module jars will be in 'baseDir/BuildCraft/build/libs/&lt;build number&gt;/modules'

Your directory structure should look like this before running gradle:
***

    baseDir
    \- BuildCraft
     |- buildcraft_resources
     |- common
     |- ...
     \- BuildCraftAPI
      |- api
      |- ...
     \- BuildCraft-Localization
      |- lang
      |- ...

***

And like this after running gradle:
***

    basedir
    \- BuildCraft
     |- .gradle
     |- build
     |- buildcraft_resources
     |- common
     |- ...
     \- BuildCraftAPI
      |- api
      |- ...
     \- BuildCraft-Localization
      |- lang
      |- ...

***

### Localizations

Localizations can be submitted [here](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft-Localization). Localization PRs against
this repository will have to be rejected.

### Depending on BuildCraft

Instructions for depending on BC 7.1.x can be found [here](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/blob/7.1.x/README.md) (for 1.7.10).

8.0.x hasn't been finished yet, so there are no instructions for depending on it :(

The following instructions are for BC 7.99.12 (1.12.2):

Add the following to your build.gradle file:
```
repositories {
    maven {
        name ""BuildCraft""
        url = ""https://mod-buildcraft.com/maven""
    }
}
````

If you want to depend on JUST the API then do this:
````
dependencies {
    deobfCompile ""com.mod-buildcraft:buildcraft-api:7.99.12""
}
````

If you want to depend on JUST the lib then do this:
````
dependencies {
    deobfCompile ""com.mod-buildcraft:buildcraft-lib:7.99.12""
}
````

If you want to depend on the whole of buildcraft do this:
```
dependencies {
    deobfCompile ""com.mod-buildcraft:buildcraft:7.99.12""
}
```
Where `7.99.12` is the desired version of BuildCraft.

  <br />MCEdit is a versatile map utility, designed for moving blocks from one level to another. With it, you can open a level of nearly any type and fly around in glorious 3D with multiple levels of detail!  Select millions of blocks and clone them anywhere else in the level.  Fill a boxy selection with the block of your choice, or replace one kind of block with another.  Export blocks to a &quot;schematic&quot; file for later use.  Import a schematic or an entire level into any world using the crane.  Move the player or his spawn point.  Create and and remove chunks from the world.  Fill blackened areas with light.  Find bugs!

Caveats:

After increasing the window size, mouse input no longer works correctly.  
Restart MCEdit to fix this.
 
Support for non-English computers and foreign character sets is shaky. For best results, 
put the MCEdit folder directly into your C:\

Creating and deleting chunks will save them to disk or delete them immediately.

Cannot resize finite levels.

Many tiles are replaced when converting from the older maps to
Minecraft Alpha maps.  All cloth tiles are bleached white and any
""Infinite"" liquids are replaced with still liquids.

The conversion also works the other way:  Blocks introduced since Alpha are
converted to white cloth when moved to a Classic level. There is no way to control
which blocks are replaced during a conversion.

There is no conversion between the old Indev and the older Creative/Survival.
Take caution when copying between them. 

Classic levels require their dimensions to be in the file name, or 
else MCEdit will attempt to guess them based on the file's size.

Having too many filters in the filters folder causes the list to go invisible. Remove some filters from the list to make the list in MCedit show up.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/martinsik/minecraft-dynmap-timemachine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/martinsik/minecraft-dynmap-timemachine)

Python 2.7, 3.3+ and PyPy command line script that downloads tiles from a Minecraft's Dynmap plugin HTTP server and composes one image in extremely large resolution suitable for print.

![Scaled down image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinsik/minecraft-dynmap-timemachine/master/doc/majncraft.3320.crop.png)

This is a scaled down and croped image form original `20736 x 13824px`. You can also [download full size 389 MB image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hhq6jbuxyu6fmr0/majncraft.20736.full.png?dl=0). See example bellow.

List of all parameter is as follows:

    $ dynmap-timemachine.py -h
    usage: dynmap-timemachine.py [-h] [--list-worlds] [--list-maps] [-t [THRESHOLD]] [-q] [-v]
                   base_url [world] [map] [center] [boundary_size] [zoom] [dest]
    
    positional arguments:
      base_url              Dynamp server URL
      world                 world name, use --list-worlds to list available worlds
      map                   map name, use --list-maps to list available maps

      boundary_size         size in tiles, use format: [h,v]
      zoom                  zoom level, 0 = maximum zoom
      dest                  output file name or directory
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --list-worlds         list available worlds from this Dynmap server and exit
      --list-maps           list available maps for this world and exit
      -t [THRESHOLD], --threshold [THRESHOLD]
                            threshold for timelapse images
      -q, --quiet
      -v, --verbose

## Installation

Most easily install using `pip`:

    $ pip install dynmap_timemachine

## 1. Example - capture one large image

Let's say we want to download a `20736x13824`px map (286 Mpx image) from [map.majncraft.cz](http://map.majncraft.cz/) at Minecraft position `[3300,65,-2630]`.


1. **First see what worlds are available and what's the name of the world that we want**

   ```
   $ dynmap-timemachine.py --list-worlds http://map.majncraft.cz/
   world - Svět Majncraft | Overworld
   world_space - Vesmír | Space
   world_nether - Nether Reloaded
   ```

   We want the first world on the list called simply `world`.

2. **Then list all maps avaialble for this world**

   ```
   $ dynmap-timemachine.py --list-maps http://map.majncraft.cz/ world
   surface - Prostorová - Den
   surface_night - Prostorová - Noc
   populated - Osídlení světa - prostorové
   flat - Plochá - Den
   populated_flat - Osídlení světa - ploché
   ```
    
   This lists flat, isometric, cave and all other types of maps together. Map names depend on Dynmap's configuration. We want the first one called `surface` which is an isometric map.
   
3. **Make a test image with Minecraft's coordinates**

   Check your coordinates on Dynmap or simply walk in Minecraft at the position that you want to capture and press F3 to see what are your Minecraft's coordinates. Then make a test image to make sure that the position captured by `minecraft-dynmap-timelapse` is correct:
   
   ```
   $ dynmap-timemachine.py http://map.majncraft.cz/ world surface \
       [3300,65,-2630] [3,2] 0 majncraft.test.png
   ```
   
   Used parameters:
   
   - `http://map.majncraft.cz/` - Dynmap's HTTP server URL
   - `world` - World name
   - `surface` - Map name
   - `[3300,65,-2630]` - Minecraft coordiantes that will be automatically converted to tile names
   - `[3,2]` - Number of tiles I want to download in each direction from specified coordinates. That's two to the left and right, two to the top and bottom. This will actually download 6x4 grid where each tile is 128x128 pixels. In total this image will be 768x512 pixels
   - `0` - Zoom level. 0 means maximum zoom in. Number of zoom levels depend's on Dynamp's configuration
   - `majncraft.test.png` - Output file name
   
   This should generate a 768x512 image:
   
   ![Preview from 6x4 grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinsik/minecraft-dynmap-timemachine/master/doc/majncraft.3320.test.png)
   
4. **Make a full size image in 20736x13824 resolution (162x108 tiles)**
   
   Finally, we can make the full size image:
   
   ```
   $ dynmap-timemachine.py -v http://map.majncraft.cz/ world surface \
       [3300,65,-2630] [81,54] 0 majncraft.3320.full.png
   ```
   
   This takes a while because in total it needs to download `81 * 2 * 54 * 2 = 17496` tiles. The final image has 389 MB.
   
   ![The final image scaled down to 728px width](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinsik/minecraft-dynmap-timemachine/master/doc/majncraft.3320.thumb.png)
   
   You can download the [full 20736x13824 size image for this example (389 MB)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hhq6jbuxyu6fmr0/majncraft.20736.full.png?dl=0) or a different, [smaller 16384x10240 image (168 MB)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c6zzpv2cd26x76g/majncraft.16384.png?dl=0) if you just want to see what it looks like in full resolution.
   
## 2. Example - create timelapse video

Another use case is creating timelapse animations from multiple images captured from a Dynmap.
   
Usage is the same as capturing a single image but this time the last argument is not an output file name but it's a directory for timelapse images instead. File names are generated automatically. The script captures an image from Dynmap and then compares it with the last image in the directory. Only if these two are significantly different (by default 1% of pixels; you can change it with `-t|--threshold`) it saves the new image.
   
You can ideally schedule to run this script every few minutes when you're building something and it'll genereate series of images capturing your progress named by the time they were captured.
   
   1. **Create a directory for timelapse images**
   
   ```
   $ mkdir images
   ```
   
   2. **Run `dynmap-timemachine.py` periodically (eg. with `cron`)** 
   
   ```
   $ dynmap-timemachine.py -v http://map.majncraft.cz/ world surface \
       [3300,65,-2630] [4,3] 0 images/
   ```
   
   Note that this image should be relatively small because we want it to capture the map at this particular moment. That's why it can't take hours like the previous example.

575,CloudburstMC/ProxyPass,Java,"# ProxyPass

### Introduction

Proxy pass allows developers to MITM a vanilla client and server without modifying them. This allows for easy testing 
of the Bedrock Edition protocol and observing vanilla network behavior.

__ProxyPass requires  Java 8 u162 or later to function correctly due to the encryption used during login__<br>
`online-mode` __needs to be set to__ `false` __in__ `server.properties` __so that ProxyPass can communicate with your Bedrock Dedicated Server.__

This repository is used in order to store the various JSON files used for the Minecraft mod [NotEnoughUpdates](https://github.com/Moulberry/NotEnoughUpdates).

<h2 align=""center""> How to contribute </h2>

In order to contribute to the item repo you should enable the item editor tools by editing your config, in your configNew.json (`.minecraft\config\notenoughupdates\configNew.json`) ensure the following values are set:

```json
""repositoryEditing"": true,
""dev"": true,
```

I would also highly recommend disabling auto update if you are in the middle of making changes otherwise they will be overwritten.

```json
""autoupdate"": false,
```

Once you have these options enabled you can edit and add items in-game using the following keybinds:

- `k` - Opens the item editor.
  - TIP: typing 2 `&` converts into `§`
- `o` - While in an items recipe menu, add the recipe.
- `y` - Opens a pane on the left side of your inventory.
- left `ctrl` - Hold to show the NBT data of an item.
  - left `ctrl`+`h` - copies the nbt data to your clipboard.
- `b` - While viewing the essence guide of an item, add the essence to the essencecost.json.

Once you have made the changes you would like you can find the files located in `.minecraft\config\notenoughupdates\repo`.

If you need further help on how to contribute feel free to join the [discord](https://discord.gg/moulberry) or contact `IRONM00N#0001` on discord.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/zhuowei/MCPELauncher/workflows/Build%20BlockLauncher/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zhuowei/MCPELauncher/actions)

## Building

BlockLauncher's build system is complicated and out of date. It still uses Ant
(and thus is incompatible with Android Studio), and uses older versions of various libraries.

Scripts to setup a build environment can be found in `tools/ci/ci_build.sh`.

This script is tested to work on GitHub Actions' Ubuntu 18.04 image, and on a fresh Ubuntu 19.10 install.

You may need to install:

```
sudo apt install git p7zip-full openjdk-8-jdk ant
sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
```

### I thought SwiftUI was for making buttons and VStacks and other stuff!

Yes. No one said you couldn't make it 3D though :)

### How does it work?

Perspective transforms. All the 3D functions are wrapped in my [Prism](https://github.com/aheze/Prism) library which I released last month.

### Is it 100% SwiftUI?

Yep, literally 100%. No UIKit, SceneKit, SpriteKit, etc.

579,m0r13/mclogalyzer,Python,"# MCLogalyzer #

This is a small Python script to analyze your Minecraft server log file and to
generate some nice statistics as HTML-File.

<div align=""center"">
    <a href=""http://mclogalyzer.mapcrafter.org/example""><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/GkKY9T6.png"" /></a>
</div>

Above you can see an [example](http://mclogalyzer.mapcrafter.org/example) of MCLogalyzer.

MCLogalyzer is free software and available under the GPL license.

## Installation ##

To run MCLogalyzer you need jinja2 as template engine. You can install it with
pip:

```
pip install jinja2
```

Then you can install MCLogalyzer with the `setup.py` script:

```
python setup.py install 
```

Now you can run it with `mclogalyzer`.

Alternatively you can directly run the script `mclogalyzer/mclogalyzer.py`.

## How to use the script ##

You have to pass the path to the Minecraft server log directory and the path to an
output HTML-File to the script:

```
mclogalyzer server/logs stats.html
```

Per default the script searches for a template (to generate the output file) in
the directory of the `mclogalyzer.py` script. You can also use your own
template file by specifying the option `-t template.html` or
`--template=template.html`.

You can also skip a part of the log file by specifying a time where the script
should start analyzing. To do this use the `--since` parameter. You have to
specify the time in the format `year-month-day hour:minute:second`, for example
`--since=""2013-05-16 00:00:00""`. Or, you can simply use `--month` or `--week` 
to generate the report of last month or last week.

You can use the whitelist as a guide using `--w whitelist.json`. If so, users
not included in the whitelist will be removed from final results, and users not
present in log file but present in whitelist will be added to the output.

DungeonsXL is a server mod that allows you to instantiate worlds.

Its main goal is to offer a way to use a world in a set state multiple times by a player (like for a jump'n'run), a group of players (e.g. for a quest dungeon, an adventure map or a PvE arena) or even by groups of groups of players (e.g. for PvP arenas).
DungeonsXL also provides custom game mechanics to make these worlds interesting. It might also be helpful if you want players to build something in creative mode quickly and uncomplicated without any influence on their main world data (inventory, levels etc.).

## Features
* Create as many dungeons as you wish!
* The instantiation system allows dungeons to be played by multiple groups of players at the same time without clashes.
* Dungeons are accessable through portals in one of your main worlds. [Read more...](../../wiki/getting-started#entering-the-dungeon)
* Invite players to edit single dungeons without the need to give them any further permissions. [Read more...](../../wiki/getting-started#editing-the-map)
* Allow players to build in creative mode safely without any influence to their game progress in the main worlds!
* Set checkpoints, breakable blocks, triggers, messages and much more through signs in the edit mode. [Read more...](../../wiki/signs)
* Per dungeon configuration (you should try that after you became familiar with the basics of this plugin). [Read more...](../../wiki/dungeon-configuration)
* Link multiple floors together to create large dungeons with multiple levels. [Read more...](../../wiki/getting-started#advanced-multi-floor-dungeons-mfds)
* Use a dungeon as a tutorial and give them a PEX group when they finish it. [Read more...](../../wiki/main-configuration)
* Players can play the dungeon with their own items or with configurable classes.
* _The classes support doges!_
* Mob waves: [Read more...](../../wiki/signs#wave)
* PvP
* Time limits
* A built-in custom mob system and support for MythicMobs. [Read more...](../../wiki/signs#mob)
* A powerful API: [Read more...](../../wiki/api-tutorial)
* Different game types allow you to use your maps dynamically for different purposes. [Read more...](../../wiki/game-types)
* Announcements sothat users can join the next match easily. [Read more...](../../wiki/announcements)
* Per dungeon resource packs
* ...and many more!


## The concept

If you want to learn how to use DungeonsXL step by step, please have a look at the [wiki](../../wiki) page [getting started](../../wiki/getting-started).

## Compatibility
### Server
DungeonsXL works with Spigot 1.8 and higher. However, support for 1.13-1.17 has a higher priority than support for 1.8-1.12. Old builds that support older versions are unusable for production environments. See [here](../../wiki/legacy-support) for detailed information. DungeonsXL only works with Spigot and does not support CraftBukkit builds.

### ItemsXL
DungeonsXL requires [ItemsXL](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/itemsxl.14472/) 1.0.2 to run.

### Building information and dependencies
Building DungeonsXL from source requires [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
Maven automatically fetches all dependencies and builds DungeonsXL; just run _build.bat_ or enter the command _mvn clean install_.

#### DRECommons
[DRECommons](https://github.com/DRE2N/DRECommons) is a util library for common tasks.

#### Caliburn API
[Caliburn](https://github.com/DRE2N/CaliburnAPI) is an API to read custom items and mobs from config files.

#### Vignette
[Vignette](https://github.com/DRE2N/Vignette) is a Bukkit GUI Framework.

### Java
Make sure that your server uses Java 8 or higher.

### UUIDs
Supported.

### Known incompatibilities
* Corpses
* PerWorldInventory

Many incompatibilities can be fixed with [PerWorldPlugins](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/perworldplugins/) ([fork for 1.8+](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/perworldplugins-unofficial-update-version.6454/)).
Try to add the incompatible plugins only to the worlds where you need them.

586,Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer,C++,"# Cubiomes Viewer

Cubiomes Viewer provides a graphical interface for the efficient and flexible
seed-finding utilities provided by [cubiomes](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes)
and a map viewer for the Minecraft biomes and structure generation.

The tool is designed for high performance and supports Minecraft Java Edition
main releases 1.0 - 1.19.


## Download

Precompiled binaries can be found for Linux and Windows under
[Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer/releases).
The builds are statically linked against [Qt](https://www.qt.io) and should run
as-is on most newer distributions. For the Linux build you will probably have to
add the executable flags to the binary.

A Flatpak for the tool is available on
[Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.cubitect.cubiomes-viewer).

For Arch Linux users, the tool may be found in the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cubiomes-viewer) thanks to
[JakobDev](https://github.com/JakobDev).

Non-PC platforms, such as macOS, are not formally supported, but you can check
[here](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer/issues/107) for more
information on this issue.


## Build from source

Build instructions can be found in the [buildguide](buildguide.md).


## Basic feature overview

The tool features a map viewer that outlines the biomes of the Overworld,
Nether and End dimensions, with a wide zoom range and with toggles for each
supported structure type. The active Minecraft version and seed can be changed
on the fly while a matching seeds list stores a working buffer of seeds for
examination.

The integrated seed finder is highly customizable, utilizing a hierarchical
condition system that allows the user to look for features that are relative to
one another. Conditions can be based on a varity of criteria, including
structure placement, world spawn point and requirements for the biomes of an
area. Filters can use logic gates in the form of helper conditions for even
more control, as well as Quad-Hut and Quad-Monument seed generators to quickly
look for seeds that include extremely rare structure constellations.

In the Trigger, Biome and Structure tabs the user can analyze the current seed
or the matching seeds list and inspect how the search conditions are applied
and get information on the biomes and structues that are available in a given
area.


## Screenshots

Screenshots were taken of Cubiomes-Viewer v2.5.

![structures](etc/screenshot_structures.png
""Examining structures in the nether"")


## Known issues

Desert Pyramids, Jungle Temples and, to a lesser extent, Woodland Mansions can
fail to generate in 1.18+ due to unsuitable terrain. Cubiomes will make an
attempt to estimate the terrain based on the biomes and climate noise. However,
expect some inaccurate results.

The World Spawn point for pre-1.18 versions can sometimes be off because it
depends on the presence of a grass block, that cubiomes cannot test for.

CommandHelper adds simple command aliases, complex macros,
and the ability to script your own commands and events into Minecraft,
using the MethodScript scripting language.

Compiling
---------

You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org). Once installed,
simply run:

	mvn clean package install

Maven will automatically download dependencies for you. Note: For that to work,
be sure to add Maven to your ""PATH"". If you get a message about tests failing,
try running:

	mvn -Pprovisional-build clean package install

Contributing
------------

We happily accept contributions. The best way to do this is to fork
CommandHelper on GitHub, add your changes, and then submit a pull request.
We'll look at it, make comments, and merge it into CommandHelper if
everything works out. If you make a PR, and feel your code is being
nitpicked to death, don't worry! Whenever a code review is done, it tends
to find lots of minor errors, even in a very experienced programmer. Don't
get discouraged! We'll work with you to make the changes, and all contributions
are appreciated. If the feature you want to add makes a significant change,
however, it may be best to discuss the changes with the other contributors
before you begin work on the feature.

By submitting code, you agree to dual license your code under the
the MIT License and GPL, barring the special restriction regarding code submissions,
explained in the SPECIAL_LICENSE.txt file, which is attached.

For details about code formatting standards, and other basic information for
contributors, please see the CONTRIBUTING.txt file.

Portions of CommandHelper are copyright by various contributors.

This project uses BrowserStack (https://www.browserstack.com) for testing the website.

Installing
----------

To install on Windows, you can follow the directions below (which are cross platform) or simply download the
Windows installer, found [here](https://github.com/EngineHub/CommandHelper/releases/tag/win-installer-v.1.0.1).

There are two modes of installation, both first require obtaining the MethodScript jar.
You can build it yourself, or download the official builds from Github.

For other platforms or manual installation on Windows, grab the jar from
[here](https://github.com/EngineHub/CommandHelper/packages/).

Minecraft: Installation in Minecraft is simple. Simply drop the jar in the plugins
folder.

Standalone Programming: MethodScript is a fledgling general purpose programming language,
and can be used from the command line, much like python, node, or other programming
languages.

For all platforms, place the jar file in whatever location you like, (noting that
it will create a folder at the same level which contains the configuration files, so
it's probably easiest to put this in your user directory),
then run `java -jar MethodScript.jar install-cmdline` as root/Administrator.
This will install the `mscript` program and add it to your path,
which can be used to start a REPL shell for quick tasks, execute a script file, or
easily run the commandline tools. On Windows, this also installs a PowerShell module,
which can be used with `Import-Module -Name MethodScript` and `Invoke-MethodScript`. On Windows,
you must reboot your system after installation to use the `mscript` command in cmd.exe.
You can install MethodScript using the same jar that is used in the Minecraft server,
though two different environments are used, with separate folders for the CommandHelper
installation, and the MethodScript installation. You can symlink these folders together if you
wish your configuration to be the same for both environments.

Commandline Tools: Various command line tools are available for use, and are useful
both for those that use the jar as a plugin, or as a general purpose language. Run
`java -jar MethodScript.jar help` for a list of these tools, or if you have installed
the commandline version, you can use `mscript -- help`.

589,EssentialGG/Elementa,Kotlin,"## Components

All the drawing in Elementa is done via UIComponents. There is a root component named `Window`
that MUST be in the hierarchy of all components, thus making it the top of the component tree. 
All components have exactly `1` parent, and all components have `0-n` children.

To create a component, simply instantiate an existing implementation such as `UIBlock`, 
or extend `UIComponent` yourself.

```java
// Manually create and store a window instance. The Window is the entry point for Elementa's event system,
// in that you must call events on the window instance manually, the most common of which would be Window#draw.
// This call must be made every frame or else the library will never render your components. If your Gui extends
// Elementa's WindowScreen, this step will already be done and a window will be provided.
Window window = new Window();

// Here we are creating an instance of one of the simplest components available, a UIBlock.
// Next, we have to add it to our hierarchy in some way, and in this instance we want it to be
// a child of the Window. Now that it is in the hierarchy, it will be drawn when we render our Window.
UIComponent box = new UIBlock().setChildOf(window);
```

## Constraints

All components have a set of constraints that determine its X/Y position, width/height, and color.
The default set of constraints sets a component's x, y, width, height to be 0, and color to be Color.WHITE.

A key thing to realize with these components is that everything is relative to its parent. When we
center a component, it will be in the center of its _direct_ parent, whether it is the Window or
perhaps another UIBlock.

This also showcases exactly how declarative the library is. Our code is saying that we would like our box
to be in the center of our parent, and that is all we need to do. No code to figure out how to position it there,
no code to calculate. We simply describe exactly what we want, and Elementa will do the rest for you.

```java
UIComponent box = new UIBlock()
    .setX(new CenterConstraint())
    .setY(new PixelConstraint(10f))
    .setWidth(new PixelConstraint(0f))
    .setHeight(new PixelConstraint(36f));
```

## Effects

Additionally, a component can have a list of effects, special modifiers that can affect the rendering of
a component or its children. One of the most common effects is the `ScissorEffect`. When enabled for
an arbitrary component, this effect restricts all of its children to be drawn inside its own boundaries.
Anything drawn outside that area will simply be cut off. Any component that is not a child (direct or indirect)
of the component where the effect is enabled will not have their rendering affected.

```java
UIComponent box = new UIBlock().enableEffect(new ScissorEffect());
```

## Animations

Elementa also provides a strong animation API. When you make an animation, you set all the
new constraints you would like to animate to, as well as the length (and optionally, delay)
of the animation.

When animating, you have a wide variety of animation strategies (algorithms) to choose from, and you can
of course implement more yourself. All the built-in animation strategies come from
the `Animations` enum.

```java
AnimatingConstraints anim = box.makeAnimation();
anim.setWidthAnimation(Animations.OUT_EXP, 0.5f, new ChildBasedSizeConstraint(2f));
anim.onCompleteRunnable(() -> {
    // Trigger new animation or anything.
});
box.animateTo(anim);
``` 

## Basic Events

Elementa also provides some basic events that can run your animations, or anything else of your choosing.

```java
// Runs a single time when the mouse moves from a state of not hovering to hovering.
box.onMouseEnterRunnable(() -> {
    // Animate, set color, run business logic, etc.
    // Animate, set color, etc.
    
});

AnimatingConstraints anim = box.makeAnimation();
anim.setWidthAnimation(Animations.OUT_EXP, 0.5f, new ChildBasedSizeConstraint(2f));
// This will run when the animation is complete.
// If this animation had multiple ""animation components"",
// this would trigger when they were all complete.
anim.onCompleteRunnable(() -> {
    // Trigger new animation or anything.
});
box.animateTo(anim);
```

There are many more events than solely those two, and they can be found throughout `UIComponent`.
Keep in mind that all events stem from the Window component, and events must be manually
called on the Window. For example, in order to receive an `onMouseClick` event,
you MUST call Window#mouseClick. In a GuiScreen, this would be done by overriding the `mouseClicked`
method.

## All together

This is a basic excerpt of code from an Elementa GUI. To see a more fleshed out
example, look to the `JavaTestGui` class.

```java
public class TestGui extends WindowScreen {
    UIComponent box = new UIBlock()
        .setX(new CenterConstraint())
        .setY(new PixelConstraint(10f))
        .setWidth(new PixelConstraint(0f))
        .setHeight(new PixelConstraint(36f))
        .setChildOf(getWindow())
        .enableEffect(new ScissorEffect());

    public TestGui() {
        box.onMouseEnterRunnable(() -> {
            // Animate, set color, etc.
            AnimatingConstraints anim = box.makeAnimation();
            anim.setWidthAnimation(Animations.OUT_EXP, 0.5f, new ChildBasedSizeConstraint(2f));
            anim.onCompleteRunnable(() -> {
                // Trigger new animation or anything.
            });
            box.animateTo(anim);
        });
    }
}
```

591,erich666/Mineways,C++,"# Mineways, a Minecraft mapper and exporter.
**by Eric Haines, erich@acm.org**

**begun 11/14/2011**

**http://mineways.com**

[Visit the project homepage](http://mineways.com) for executables for PC and Mac, documentation links, credits, etc.
Much of the mapping and UI code is built on the open-source project [Minutor](http://seancode.com/minutor/).

There are different major versions of Mineways. You usually want the latest version; version 1.15 can be used on older worlds.
* **Version 6.** works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.13 and beyond, but is 64-bit only.
* **Version 5.** works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.9 and beyond, adds scripting language.
* **Version 4.** works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.9-ish and beyond, 64-bit for large exports.
* **Version 3.** works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.7 worlds (Anvil, stair geometry changes, and new texturing).
* **Version 2.x** works on Minecraft 1.2 worlds to 1.4 (Anvil format).
* **Version 1.x** works on Minecraft 1.1 worlds and earlier (McRegion format).

Source files are here:

* **Win/** contains the Windows version of Mineways (in C++).
* **TileMaker/** contains the TileMaker for Mineways, which takes the individual block textures and forms a terrainExt.png file for use by Mineways. This allows you to replace any terrain textures with your own custom tiles.

Compiling
--------------

* Windows - You can compile this with Visual Studio Community 2022
You will need to install the ""Desktop development with C++"" workload. You will also need to go to ""Individual components"", search on ""MFC"", and choose ""C++ MFC for latest v143 build tools (x86 & x64)"".

Open Mineways.sln in Visual C++, switch the target to Release and x64, compile the solution to
		`generate Mineways.exe`

Sorry, other platforms are not directly supported, though Mineways runs fine under [WINE](http://www.winehq.org/) and we also provide a Mac-specific version.

If you want to work on the mapping part of this program on another platform, see [Minutor](http://seancode.com/minutor/), which *is* supported on Mac and Linux.

# Development

This project provides a Gradle project template that can compile mods for both Forge and Fabric using a common sourceset. This project does not require any third party libraries or dependencies.

## IntelliJ IDEA
This guide will show how to import the MultiLoader Template into IntelliJ IDEA. The setup process is roughly equivalent to setting up Forge and Fabric independently and should be very familiar to anyone who has worked with their MDKs.

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open the template's root folder as a new project in IDEA. This is the folder that contains this README file and the gradlew executable.
3. If your default JVM/JDK is not Java 17 you will encounter an error when opening the project. This error is fixed by going to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle > Gradle JVM`and changing the value to a valid Java 17 JVM. You will also need to set the Project SDK to Java 17. This can be done by going to `File > Project Structure > Project SDK`. Once both have been set open the Gradle tab in IDEA and click the refresh button to reload the project.
4. Open the Gradle tab in IDEA if it has not already been opened. Navigate to `Your Project > Common > Tasks > vanilla gradle > decompile`. Run this task to decompile Minecraft.
5. Open the Gradle tab in IDEA if it has not already been opened. Navigate to `Your Project > Forge > Tasks > forgegradle runs > genIntellijRuns`. Run this task to set up run configurations for Forge.
6. Open your Run/Debug Configurations. Under the Application category there should now be options to run Forge and Fabric projects. Select one of the client options and try to run it.
7. Assuming you were able to run the game in step 7 your workspace should now be set up.

### Eclipse
While it is possible to use this template in Eclipse it is not recommended. During the development of this template multiple critical bugs and quirks related to Eclipse were found at nearly every level of the required build tools. While we continue to work with these tools to report and resolve issues support for projects like these are not there yet. For now Eclipse is considered unsupported by this project. The development cycle for build tools is notoriously slow so there are no ETAs available.

  These are the important information for Minecraftly Cloud Platform.  Read them carefully,
as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to install the
software, and what to do if something goes wrong. 

##What is Minecraftly?
  Minecraftly (Minecraftly Cloud Platform) is a free and open source (FOSS) alternative of the official Mojang's Minecraft Realms, designed and written from scratch by Viet Nguyen and Keir Nellyer, respectively, with assistance from some friendly developers and helpers from the internet. It aims towards creating an easy to run a distributed network, on any server, using traditional server system. Minecraftly Cloud Platform is now community-developed and will be remained free under GNU GPL license.
  
  Started out as a simple Minecraft game server like every other, I understood and saw the importance of education through gaming. The period of changing mindset from owning a proprietary software to deciding if I should open source it was not short of a challenge. In the end, I'm glad that I was able to open source it, and share it with passionate people who want to contribute to the community, to change the world via cloud computing, and with everyone who wants to learn.

  It has all the features you would expect in a Minecraft server, with additional performance gain
  including async, cloud computing compatibility, on demand
  loading.
  
  Minecraftly can run on traditional Minecraft server setup, with local file system. The advantage is, it's able to run on one and multiple servers at the same time, sharing the same NFS, Redis, and MySQL servers as a way of communicating between servers.
  
  We currently support the latest version of Minecraft. The version is always up to date.
  
##Why Open Source?
  I'm [Viet](https://twitter.com/vietdoge), a simple guy with love for cloud computing, the web, technologies, and Minecraft just like you. Ever since I first run a Minecraft server in 2012, I've always been looking for a way to scale Minecraft with high availability and fault tolerant. It took me years to think and build the first prototype after seeing that not many people in the community have a high availability mindset. I can't do it alone and need your contribution to make it better.
  
  I dedicated myself to cloud computing and passed my AWS Solutions Architect Certification exam in 2015. It helped construct my knowledge to build a simplier open source project that anyone can test, build, host their own network.
  
##How it works
  As an alternative of Mojang's Minecraft Realms, if you install Minecraftly in your server, then each of your player will have his/her own server, accessible via (player's MC username).(your domain name).com
  
##Player Flow
 Usually, in a normal Minecraft server, player flow is like this:
```ruby
                               Player A
                                  |
                                  |
                                  |
                                  ▼ 
                              Server 1
                                  |
                                  |
                                  |
                                  ▼ 
                               World 1
```
 With the old way of distributing players, a single machine gets filled up with players very quickly, and will crash at a certain amount of concurrent players online.

 Let's visualize a smarter way to distribute players. In Minecraftly, it's like this:
```ruby
                               Player A
                                  |
                                  |
                                  |
                                  ▼ 
                       Server 1 or 2 or 3 or ∞
                                  |
                                  |
                                  |
                                  ▼ 
                               World A
```
 As you can see, in this method, it doesn't matter which server brings player his/her own world when they log in, as long as the one server serves the correct world to the correct player at that correct moment.
 
 You will then ask: The visualization above shows one player and one world. What about multiple players at the same time? Here you go:
```ruby
     Player A          Player B          Player C          Player D          Player E
        |                 |                 |                 |                 |
        |                 |                 |                 |                 |
        |                 |                 |                 |                 |
        ▼                 ▼                 ▼                 ▼                 ▼
    Server 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or ... or ∞
        |                 |                 |                 |                 |
        |                 |                 |                 |                 |
        |                 |                 |                 |                 |
        ▼                 ▼                 ▼                 ▼                 ▼
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                                                                                  |
   | World A           World B            World C           World E           World F |
   |                                                                                  |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
 How do I store world A, B, C, D, E, and F for the respective players and load them as fast as possible, using traditional way of saving worlds on disk?
 
 The answer is to have all servers using the same ""global worlds"" folder, storing all the worlds for the respective player there.
 
 For multiple servers to ""share the same folder"", the simpliest way is to use NFS (Network File System) server.
 
##Architecture
  Minecraftly operates under the premise that everything can fail at anytime, so we focus on designing a high availability, fault tolerant system that can withstand failure at the server, database, or network level.
  
  First, let's visualize the stack:
  
```ruby
                           Minecraft Players
                                  ▲
                                  |
                                  |
                                  |
                                  ▼
      +----------------- Network Load Balancer -----------------+
      |                           |                             |
      |                           |                             |
      |                           |                             |
   BungeeCord 1              BungeeCord 2                 BungeeCord n
      |                           |                             |
      |                           |                             |
      |                           |                             |
   Spigot 1                    Spigot 2                      Spigot n
      |                           |                             |
      |                           |                             |
      |                           |                             |
      +------------------- NFS, MySQL & Redis ------------------+
      
```
  
  According to the drawing above, you can clearly see that all BungeeCord & Spigot servers share the same NFS, MySQL and Redis servers. In this case, we call such shared server ""endpoints"" (because behind the endpoints maybe a cluster of servers as well.

  There are an infinite amount of BungeeCord and Spigot servers, having the same exact configuration. It doesn't matter how many BungeeCord or Spigot servers out there. As long as they use the same NFS mount point, the same MySQL server, and the same Redis server, then the player's experience will be unified.
  
##Single Machine Environment (for testing)
To build a single machine test environment, it will be visualized like this:

```ruby
                           Minecraft Players
                                  ▲
                                  |
                                  |
                                  |
                                  ▼
   BungeeCord 1 (port 25565)                    BungeeCord 2 (port 25566)
      |                                                         |
      |                                                         |
      |                                                         |
   Spigot 1 (port 25567)                           Spigot 2 (port 25568)
      |                                                         |
      |                                                         |
      |                                                         |
      +--------------------- MySQL & Redis ---------------------+
      
```
  
  This testing environment is very simple. It works with traditional server cluster (VM, dedicated servers, etc...). It can also work with cloud servers (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure).
  
##Requirements
 * BungeeCord: serve as a proxy server
 * Spigot: serve as Minecraft server
 * MySQL Server
 * Redis Server (Will plan to not depend on Redis and RedisBungee)
 * RedisBungee plugin (Will plan to not depend on Redis and RedisBungee)
 * Vault plugin (for permissions hook)
 * ProtocolLib plugin (Will plan to not depend on ProtocolLib)

##How is it better than [Minecraft Realms](https://minecraft.net/realms)?
 Minecraftly is better than Minecraft Realms in many ways. First, let's look at how complex and redundant Minecraft Realms is
![screen shot Minecraft Realms Architecture](https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2014/minecraft_realms_arch_2.png)
 Cloud computing doesn't need to be that complicated. It's complicated mainly because of intellectual properties. Since we're open source, we can make it as simple and as extendable as possible.
 
 Here are some simple comparisons:
 * Minecraftly doesn't need Frontend, Manager, Controller, and Amazon S3 object storage
 * Minecraftly doesn't need move world from object storage back to local block storage, which means players can load world right away.
 * Minecraftly lets players jump from server to server in real time, embracing the feeling of having many people playing with you at the same time.
 * Minecraftly saves server cost more efficiently than Minecraft Realms. While Realms creates a separated server for each paid player which is costly, we use one server for many free and paid players, and still deliver better and more seamless performance.

- [x] Create world with UUID format for each player with the same UUID
- [x] Multiple servers pointing to one folder that serves worlds
- [ ] Let players mute, kick, ban and trust others in their own world
- [ ] Let players teleport to others via /tpa {username}, /tpahere {username}, /server {username} commands.

596,gnembon/carpetmod,Java,"# :ghost: This repository is deprecated as is Minecraft 1.13 by itself and no longer will be maintained. 
### To get updated version of carpet for 1.14 and above, check :arrow_forward: https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet project, that uses fabric framework. 

## CarpetMod for Minecraft 1.13.2
The most comprehensive and convoluted mod for carpets evar. Built based on jarmod-buildsystem-2 by Earthcomputer using Forge Gradle system by Minecraft Forge team. See Earthcomputer's repo for details on the build system.

## Gimme, gimme, I just wanna play
- Then go get the install package (zip folder) for your system from https://github.com/gnembon/carpetmod/releases , and follow the README that is inside of the zip package. Each installer contains patches for both server and singleplayer versions, and (the best case scenario) should require you to just doubleclick (running) on one patching script.

## I installed it. Need help
- Run `/carpet list` to see all the togglable options with description
- Click on a feature in the list in chat, or type `/carpet <featureName>` to get detailed help about each feature.

## tl;dr (to help us develop carpet mod)
- Have Java SDK and git installed (prefferably, or download zipped repo to a folder)
- open command prompt  
- type:
- - `git clone https://github.com/gnembon/carpetmod.git`
- - `cd carpetmod`
- - `gradlew setup`
- - `gradlew genPatches`
- - `gradlew createRelease`
- patches for client and server are in `/build/distributions`
- optionally (to patch the server automatically)
- - have commandline 7za installed
- - `patch_server.cmd`
- - your server should be running in your saves folder already. Connect to `localhost`
- optionally: create installers (depending on the host OS and target OS)
- - `cd installer`
- - `create_installer_<win|mac|ux>.<cmd|sh>`
 

## Requirements
- You need to have at least JDK8 update 92 for recompilation to work, due to a bug in earlier versions of `javac`. You also cannot use JDK9 or JDK10 yet.
- You need to have `git` installed.
- Eclipse Oxygen.3 or later, due to [this Eclipse bug](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=526911).
- Or Intellij

OR

- Download the patches from the releases section and apply them directly to game's or server's jars.

## First-time setup
- Copy all the files in this repository into your new project folder.
- Run `gradlew setup` to decompile, deobfuscate the code and apply carpet patches.
- Run `gradlew eclipse` to setup the appropriate Eclipse projects. Do this even if you are planning on using Intellij IDEA.
- If you use Eclipse, open Eclipse, and navigate to `File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace`. Navigate to and select the `projects` subdirectory, and check your mod project, and optionally the clean (unmodified) project too.
- Otherwise, open Intellij IDEA and import the Eclipse project. From 3 available projects choose one in `projects/carpetmod`

## Project layout + management
Once you have setup the project, you should see a file structure which looks something like this:
```
- src/main/java This is where all of the MINECRAFT classes go, i.e. classes which you may or may not have modified, but no classes you have added.
- src/main/resources Similar to src/main/java except for non-java files.
- main-java This is where all of the MOD classes go, i.e. the classes which you have added.
- main-resources Similar to main-java except for non-java files.
```
From outside Eclipse, the file structure looks a little different. However, you should avoid editing these files from outside your IDE of choice:
```
- src/main/java The MOD classes
- src/main/resources The MOD resources
- patches Patches your mod has made to the MINECRAFT classes, which can be pushed to public repositories
- projects/<modname>/src/main/java * The MINECRAFT classes
- projects/<modname>/src/main/resources * The MINECRAFT resources
- projects/clean/src/main/java * The unmodified MINECRAFT classes
- projects/clean/src/main/resources * The unmodified MINECRAFT resources
* = ignored by git
```

- You should be able to run Minecraft directly from within the IDE.
- Every time you checkout a branch which has changed files in the `patches` directory, you need to run `gradlew setup` again to update the code in `src/main/java` inside the IDE. This will not try to decompile again like it did the first time, so won't take long. This will overwrite your local changes.
- Every time you make changes to MINECRAFT classes and want to push to the public repo, you need to run `gradlew genPatches` to update the patch files in the `patches` directory. This takes a few seconds.
- When you are ready to create a release, run `gradlew createRelease`. This may take longer than the other tasks because it is recompiling the code. Once it is done, your releases can be found in the `build/distributions` directory. It includes patches for server jar as well as standalone client jar

## Settings you can change
Accessible in `conf/settings.json`. Beware that changes to this may significanly modify the carpetmod patches so only do it if you know what your are doing or you want to keep your own fork
- `modname` the name of your mod.
- `modversion` the version your mod is on.
- `mcpconfig` the MCPConfig version you are using.
- `mappings` the MCP mappings you are using.
- `mcversion` the Minecraft version.
- `pipeline`, either `joined`, `client` or `server` - whether your mod is to be a client-side-only or server-side-only mod, or to be both and share the same codebase.
- `clientmain` the main class on the client.
- `servermain` the main class on the server.
- `reformat` whether to run Artistic Style on the code to reformat it. Makes the build process a little slower but does mean you can change the formatting options with `conf/astyle.cfg`.
- `customsrg` The custom tsrg file inside the `conf/` folder, to override the one in the MCPConfig distribution, used to deobfuscate even newer Minecraft versions.

## A word of warning
1.13 modding is still in its infancy, and there are already known bugs that occur in the decompiled code which do not occur in vanilla. If you care about maintaining vanilla behaviour, then whenever making a change which may modify a certain vanilla class, make sure to weigh up the benefit of modifying said class against the risk that there might be a decompile bug in the class. This situation is constantly improving as 1.13 modding matures, but for now you can at least minimize the effect by distributing as few modified classes as possible.

606,PatchworkMC/patchwork-api,Java,"# THIS IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED, A REPLACEMENT IS BEING DEVELOPED BEHIND THE SCENES

A best-effort reimplementation of the Minecraft Forge API.

## Here be dragons
Patchwork only runs a small amount of mods. It is not yet ready for general use--we are only looking for developers. Testers and users aren't needed or desired at this time.

While we don't encourage (or provide support for) running Patchwork, you can track our progess at our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/YYZtNBG).

If you know Java and would like to contribute, check out our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), and join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/YYZtNBG).
## Technical details
Patchwork API aims to re-implement the entirety of Minecraft Forge as a set of small and modular Fabric mods. This is in order to run Minecraft Forge mods patched using [Patchwork Patcher](https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-patcher) on Fabric.

However, Patchwork aims not only to simply *run* Forge mods on Fabric but additionally aims to maintain a superior level of code quality to Forge. We feel the Fabric toolchain is superior to Forge on a technical level, but lacks both the sheer quantity of hooks and features as well as existing mod support. Thus, Patchwork seeks to provide both the benefits of Fabric and the benefits of Forge.

This modular organization is modeled after the organization of [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric). This may seem like a confusing decision because Minecraft Forge itself is monolithic, but there are a few good reasons:

1. **Porting**. Since each module is a separate compilation unit, it is possible to port individual modules at a time to newer Minecraft versions. Less critical modules can also be disabled until more critical modules have been ported first.
2. **Organization**. Modules keep related code together and unrelated code separate. This means that Mixins are located in the same place with code using them. Keeping related code close together makes it easier to reason about the code, and analyze each module in isolation.
3. **It works**. The modular organization has already been used by Fabric API to great success.

On Forge, this mod requires PAUCAL, Patchouli and Kotlin for Forge. On Fabric, it requires PAUCAL, Patchouli, and Fabric
Language Kotlin.

- [Discord link](https://discord.gg/4xxHGYteWk)

## The Branches

We are currently developing Hexcasting v1.x for 1.19.2, on the `main` branch.

The 0.9.x versions, for 1.18.2, are in long-term support. We probably won't be adding any new features, but we will try
to fix bugs. Those are on the `1.18` branch.

The `gh-pages` branch is for the online Hex book.

Other branches are old detritus from potential features.

## For Developers

We publish artifacts on Maven at [https://maven.blamejared.com/at/petra-k/hexcasting/]. The modern coordinates are at:

> `hexcasting-[PLATFORM]-[MC VERSION]/[MOD VERSION]`

There are some other folders in the `hexcasting` folder from old CI configurations; ignore those, they're stale.

Please only use things in the `at.petrak.hexcasting.api` package. (We do try to keep the API fairly stable, but we don't
do a very good job.) If you find you need something not in there yell at me on Discord.

609,mchorse/aperture,Java,"**ATTENTION**: This mod is **no longer being maintained by McHorse. It is now maintained by Chryfi.**
 There are **still going to be official updates by Chryfi and other contributors** and there have been task forces that are investigating on porting it. **If you also want to contribute to official updates**, or to the porting effort, please **join the official [McHorse's Discord server](https://discord.gg/qfxrqUF), so we can communicate with you.** Check out the [source code](https://github.com/mchorse/aperture). 

![Aperture](https://i.imgur.com/Wras78u.png)

[Planet Minecraft page](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/aperture-3978432/) – [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aperture) – [GitHub](https://github.com/mchorse/aperture) – [Wiki](https://github.com/mchorse/aperture/wiki) 

**Disclaimer**: this mod has nothing to do with Aperture Science from Portal games. See the article on what is [Aperture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture) actually is.

**Aperture** is a Minecraft mod which allows you to create advanced camera movement (for cinematics or machinimas) using camera editor GUI. It works with Forge for Minecraft 1.12.2 (past versions are available for 1.10.2 and 1.11.2).

Aperture is also available in Chinese language thanks to [ycwei982](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfUDMSGlXUblXimkvNl_7Ww), Chunk7, H2SO4GepaoAX and KuenYo, and Russian language thanks to [Andruxioid](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnHOceBjwMyqCR5oYOoNqhQ)!

## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), download the latest stable version of jar file for available Minecraft version. Also install following mods: [McLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mchorses-mclib). Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, Aperture mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If Aperture didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong. 

## For whom is this mod for?

If you want to setup cameras for a Minecraft machinima/roleplay, and you already use [Blockbuster mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blockbuster) in **singleplayer**, then this is a mod for you!

Aperture mod provides a ton of features to improve your camera (in comparison to other camera): 

* Camera profiles that lets you load and save camera work.
* Camera fixtures are building blocks within camera profile which lets you flexibly setup different camera movement depending on the type of fixture it is.
* Camera modifiers allow to post process movement to apply certain effects on top of camera fixtures.
* Works with [Minema](https://github.com/daipenger/minema/releases).
* And so much more...

Although Aperture has partial support to work on servers, it's not recommended to use on the servers **as these mechanisms are poorly designed**!

## Videos

This playlist is a **tutorial series**. It should teach you how to use Aperture mod from scratch. It bases of Aperture `1.3.4`. Once you watch these videos and learn how to use it, feel free to watch the change log videos for more information about new features.

## Bug reports

If you found a bug, or this mod crashed your game, make sure to check this [compatibility table and incompatible mod list](https://github.com/mchorse/mclib/wiki/Compatibility-table-of-McHorse%27s-mods) page. The most frequent issue people encounter is that they didn't install the compatible versions of my mods. Or updated only one mod while using older version of my other mods.

If the versions of the mod are correct, then you can report a bug or a crash to me either on [issue tracker](https://github.com/mchorse/aperture/issues/), or on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/qfxrqUF).

### What is a limbo server ?
A limbo server is a fallback server able to handle a massive amount of simultaneous connections. The player spawns into the void then waits here. It can be used to keep players connected to a network after a lobby crashed or as an afk server.

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

### Minecraft protocol support

See [TyphoonCore's protocol support](https://github.com/TyphoonMC/TyphoonCore#minecraft-protocol-support)

#### Snapshot support
TyphoonLimbo is able to load [TyphoonDep protocol-map modules](https://github.com/TyphoonMC/TyphoonDep/tree/master/protocol-map) to add a partial snapshots support.

All json files are loaded from the ""modules"" folder in the same directory as the TyphoonLimbo binary.

You can generate a protocol-map module with the [fetcher](https://github.com/TyphoonMC/TyphoonDep/tree/master/protocol-map/fetcher). Just pick the ""page"" link of your wanted version on [wiki.vg](http://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers) as argument of the fecther and the magic will happen.

### How to build and start
```shell
git clone https://github.com/TyphoonMC/TyphoonLimbo.git
cd TyphoonLimbo
go build

## What is Cleanstone?
The plan is to properly build a scalable Minecraft Server from scratch without the outdated code and single-threaded nature that Minecraft was created with.

We dont just copy the vanilla server structure and refactor it. Instead we write it completely from scratch in our own way in which we focus on doing it right instead of keeping it close and similar to Vanilla Minecraft.

Scalable: It should be expandable e.g. you can use multiple servers for a single Minecraft world and split the load over them.

Maintainable: A proper event-driven code style with dependency injection and lots of useful abstraction e.g. the protocol (built-in multi-client-version support similar to ViaVersion/ViaBackwards)

## Multi-Threading
Cleanstone is multi-threaded by design since we are using multiple thread pools that balance the load of chunk loading, IO, etc.
In the future we want to add the possibility to balance it across multiple servers as well.
This is possible because we don't have a global tick loop that synchronizes all server actions but instead we outsource the work as modular services that can work asynchronously and are therefore scalable.

## Features
### Implemented
- Multiple Network Protocols
  - Minecraft Java Edition
    - 1.12.2
    - 1.13
    - 1.13.1
    - 1.13.2
    - 1.14
  - Minecraft Pocket Edtition
    - Basic serverlist ping support
- Async world loading and saving in LevelDB
- Online mode login
- Async chunk loading
- Breaking and placing blocks (without item drops)
- Seeing other players move around (entity tracking)
- Command system with nice sub-command and parameter abstraction
- Online admin panel to execute console commands
### TODO
- Seeing non-player entities (Missing entity metadata protocol)
- World conversion (Missing NBT Support)
- Item drops
- Special block behavior (e.g. beds)
- Spreading load over multiple servers
- Network packet encapsulation (Events for Packets)
- Chunk/Region behavior (Physics and AI)

## Installation
### Requirements
- Java 11
### Instructions
```
git clone git@github.com:CleanstoneMC/Cleanstone.git
cd Cleanstone
./gradlew assemble
java -jar build/libs/Cleanstone-0.3.1.jar
```
## No global Tick Loop?
We will probably not be able to avoid a tick loop completely when we get to redstone, gravity, etc. since too many other systems directly depend on it and it would cause too many race conditions and delays to synchronize it all.
Our trick here is to divide the world into independent regions that manage their entities and work by themselves using their own worker threads and their own independent tick loops or worker servers independent of other regions.
However, tasks like pathfinding and entity movement can be completely asynchronous nonetheless since nothing else depends on them.

## API?
Currently we aren't supporting Bukkit or Sponge since we simply need more features and fundamentals first but in the future we will add support for Bukkit and probably Sponge as well, however we wont integrate it into our code but keep it separate and map it to our own API.

620,RobertSkalko/Mine-and-Slash,Java,"This mod completely changes the combat and gear progression of minecraft, for better or worse, depending on your preferences, so i'll lay it out nice and clear what this mod does so you can make sure you want it or not.


First, the intent. The intent is to make Loot (mob drops) the primary way to obtain gear and to provide satisfying highly randomized loot drops and an in-depth player stat system that allows you to specialize and min max your character.


Secondary intent is to provide long term progression.



Now, how does this mod do this?


- All living things are given levels. The level is determined by distance from spawn. This means if you want to explore further, you'll want to level up so you can beat the tougher mobs!

- Minecraft doesn't allow more than 1000 something health so this mod stores the health value, this means mods that show mob health aren't useful, that's why i remodeled vazkii's Neat (health bar) mod to show actual health values and some useful mob traits (like a mob that does bonus lightning damage).

- Adding to that, this mod completely overrides most health and damage mechanics. This means if you get health from other sources besides this mod, it will be for nothing. Same with damage and armor. Only weapons and armors from this mod provide useful benefits. Though some vanilla things are still useful, like fire resistance enhacements.

- To get any loot from my mod, you must deal the finishing blow to the mob, this is because i don't think a level 50 player slaughtering lvl 1 mobs should be rewarded.

- Mobs recieve waaaay less enviromental damage, this is to prevent lvl 1 players cheezing lvl 50 mobs. It's still possible but you probably don't want to do it, after all level 50 gear is not usable until you're level 50

- Player attacks require energy, spells require mana. Learn to kite mobs and not waste mana.


Now let's get on to features, if you're here, you probably are fine with the drawbacks and want to play it!


- Hugely complicated gear system, all gears have primary stats and secondary stats, some have prefixes and suffixes! Primary stats give the most important things, like basic attack damage, elemental damage or health. Secondary stats, suffixes and prefixes usually multiply those primary stats or give new ones.

- Currently 8 gear slots (feet, legs, chest, head, 2 rings, necklace, bracelet) - supported by baubles mod

- Many many stats, you have health, mana, energy, hp regen, mana regen, energy regen, fire damage, bonus water damage, critical hit, critical damage, lifesteal, life on hit, dodge.. Then you have traits, stats that you can only use 1 of, like Frost Atronach that multiplies all your frost damage by 15% or Lucky that multiplies your crit chance and so on.

- Spells! Fire bolts, Thunder Explosions, Instant heals.. You have a way to fight back against those op mobs!

- In depth crafting system, kinda like Path of Exile, you have nearly 10 rare items that can be used to modify your gear. Anything from re-rolling a suffix or leveling the item. You are able to beat the randomness with smart usage of crafting items.


And blocks which i call stations!

- Salvage station, throw gear or spells (from my mod) in this, this block destroys them and gives you resources and sometimes even rare currency!

- Repair station, the only way to repair the gear items, use my mod's ores to fuel the station.

- Modify station, combine a piece of gear with a currency item in this block and it will change the item.

- Gear crafting station, sacrifice a piece of gear and some fuel (my mod's ores) to create a new piece of gear. This is a resource sink that allows rich players to pour resources into trying to get better gear. "

 There are **still going to be official updates by Chryfi and other contributors** and there have been task forces that are investigating on porting it. **If you also want to contribute to official updates**, or to the porting effort, please **join the official [McHorse's Discord server](https://discord.gg/qfxrqUF), so we can communicate with you.** Check out the [source code](https://github.com/mchorse/metamorph). 

![Metamorph](http://i.imgur.com/gbHB5iQ.png)

[Planet Minecraft page](http://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/metamorph/) – [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/metamorph) – [GitHub](https://github.com/mchorse/metamorph) – [Wiki](https://github.com/mchorse/metamorph/wiki) 

**Metamorph** (from *[Metamorphosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis)*) – a Minecraft mod which allow you to morph into mobs. 

Most of vanilla mob morphs have their abilities (preconfigured), meanwhile most of modded morphs only grant you appearance and some attributes like health, unless configured. Morphs can be disabled and configured. See mod's wiki for more information.

Heavily inspired by iChun's Morph mod and zacuke's Shape Shifter Z mod, and works only with Forge for Minecraft 1.12.2 (past versions are available for 1.10.2 and 1.11.2).

## FAQ

**Q: My screen goes up and down. How to fix?**  
A: Most likely you installed MorePlayerModels mod alongside Metamorph. To fix that, either go to `Mod Options > Metamorph > General` and enable `Disable POV` option, or disable POV option in MPM's config and restart the game.

## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), download the latest stable version of jar file for available Minecraft version. Also install following mods: [McLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mchorses-mclib). Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, Metamorph mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If Metamorph didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong.

## How to play

To morph into other creatures, you must to acquire a *morph* first. To acquire a *morph*, you have to kill a mob, then a ghost of a mob will appear (that's a *morph*), and when you'll pick it up, you'll acquire a *morph*.

Once you have at least one *morph*, you're able to transform into that *morph*. Open survival morph menu by pressing `X` key (for old users `N` key). In the menu you can select the morphs either with mouse or with arrow keys. Press **Morph** button to morph (or `Return` key). You can also favorite morphs (all the non favorite morphs can be toggled by clicking **Only favorites** toggle or `O` key). You can add a keybind to acquired morphs, which can be used inside menu and in the game.

To demorph, you can press demorph key (which is `.` by default).

You retain your *morphs* even after death (although you can disable retaining of morphs after death in mod options). In creative mode, you can select almost any available *morph* via Creative Morph Menu which can be opened by pressing `B` key in the game. 

## About morphs

Every *morph* you equip, or apply, grant you different look, size, and health capacity. Except those properties, every *morph* also has special *abilities*, *attack* and *action*. Only vanilla morphs are have configuration, for modded mobs you'll have to [configure them](https://github.com/mchorse/metamorph/wiki/Configuring-Morphs).

*Abilities* give special properties to *morphs*. **Chicken** *morph* will slowly fall and get no fall damage. **Spider** and **CaveSpider** *morphs* will be able to climb on the wall. **Bat** *morph* will be able to fly and has a night vision.

*Attack* is an effect which is applied onto attacked entity. For example, if you hit some entity while being in **CaveSpider** *morph*, your target will gain **poison** potion effect. If you'll hit an entity while being in **VillagerGolem** *morph*, you'll throw your target high in the air.

*Action* is a special ability that is triggered by ""action key"" (which is `V` by default). Examples: in **Rabbit** *morph*, you'll jump high; in **Creeper** *morph*, you'll explode like a creeper, and so on.

`puppet-minecraft` installs and configures your Minecraft or
CraftBukkit server with Puppet!

This is a derivative work of Branan Purvine-Riley's
[Minecraft module](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/branan/minecraft), with
improvements including: version selection, CraftBukkit support, a
plugin resource, and settings managed via templates. It is released
under the original Apache License, Version 2.0.

This module has been tested on Ubuntu Server 12.04.4 with Puppet 3.8.7.

## Usage

The simplest possible usage is:

```puppet
include minecraft
```

This entire class is parameterized (see the minecraft class for
details), and can be configured through hiera.

Parameters are available which control how the Minecraft installation
behaves:

* `user`: The user account for the Minecraft service
* `group`: The user group for the Minecraft service
* `install_dir`: The directory in which Minecraft stores its data
* `source`: Minecraft (semvar) or CraftBukkit ('recommended',
  'beta', or 'dev'), or direct source (URL for `wget`)
* `autostart`: Start the service at boot
* `manage_java`: Manage the JRE package
* `heap_size`: The maximum Java heap size for the Minecraft service
  in megabytes
* `heap_start`: The initial Java heap size for the Minecraft service
  in megabytes

### Minecraft Versions / CraftBukkit Builds

A particular version of Minecraft server can be downloaded by
specifying the `source` parameter. This parameter accepts a semantic
version (representing a vanilla Minecraft server), a snapshot version,
or for a [CraftBukkit](http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/)
installation, one of 'recommended', 'beta', or 'dev'. Latest vanilla
version as of this writing is 1.7.5.

Please note that once a JAR file (the server) has been downloaded to
`install_dir`, if you want to switch, you will need to manually remove
it so that the `wget::fetch` resource can update; this is a _good
thing_ as it means the tags (e.g. ""recommended"") will not auto-update
your server. This is good because you must beware incompatibilities
among Minecraft and CraftBukkit versions with world files, settings,
etc, so backup and test thoroughly before you update. (At least rolling
back to an old version is easy.)

Speaking of old versions, prior to the release of Minecraft 1.6, the
downloads were hosted at a different
[location](http://assets.minecraft.net/), but since these are quite
old, this module does not currently support it. Submit a Pull Request
if you add support, or make an issue if you want me to do so.

### Server configuration

Full configuration of the Minecraft server is supported. Simply
specify the parameter with the server setting when declaring the
class:

```puppet
class { 'minecraft':
  source     => 'dev',
  heap_size  => 2048,
  difficulty => 2,
  motd       => 'Managed by Puppet!',
  ops        => [ 'op1', 'op2' ]
}
```

[Hiera](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/puppet.html) configuration
can also be done. In [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/):

```yaml
minecraft::source: 'dev'
minecraft::heap_size: 2048
minecraft::difficulty: 2
minecraft::motd: 'Managed by Puppet, with Hiera!'
minecraft::ops:
  - 'op1'
  - 'op2'
```

Note that the server property name will use an underscore instead of a
dash, and may not exactly match the `server.properties` name. Also,
refrain from using 'undef' for the server properties, as Puppet will
place 'undef' as a string in the template; instead, use the emptry
string: ''. (It's either this or add a bunch of template logic to
check for an undef value first, for every parameter, do it and Pull
Request if you'd like.)

### Managing players

This module manages the Minecraft player settings through
templates. To add players to a particular list, declare an array of
them:

```puppet
class { 'minecraft':
  ops                => 'me',
  banned_players     => [ 'griefer', 'badboy' ],
  banned_ips         => '127.0.0.1',         # Don't actually do this
  white_list_players => [ 'my_best_friend' ] # Minecraft auto-includes ops
}
```

Note that when any of these parameters is set to undef, Puppet will
not manage the corresponding file, allowing you to manage it via
commands in Minecraft. However, if specified, Puppet will manage the
file, and overwrite any manual changes on the next application of
Puppet. (There is also the ""replace"" attribute on the Puppet file
resource, but this is not what we want because, if the file is being
managed, we want changes in the manifest to be updated in the files.)

To enable the whitelist, you must both set it to true in the class,
and add players to the whitelist here, as they affect separate
templates. Additionally, blacklists (banned IPs/players) is pointless
if the whitelist is enabled, and is only shown here concurrently for
demonstration purposes.

### Java

If `manage_java` is true, this module will use
[Puppetlabs' Java module](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java)
to install the necessary Java Runtime Environment.

### Adding CraftBukkit Plugins

CraftBukkit plugins can be installed by using the defined resource
`minecraft::plugin`. You must specify the plugin name (lacking the
'.jar' file extension) and the complete URL for the download source.

#### Dynmap Example

The
[Dynmap plugin](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1543523-dynmap-dynamic-web-based-maps-for-minecraft/)
can be configured like this:

```puppet
minecraft::plugin { 'dynmap':
  source => 'http://dev.bukkit.org/media/files/757/982/dynmap-1.9.1.jar'
}
```

Or using Hiera like this:

```yaml
minecraft::plugins:
  dynmap:
    source: http://dev.bukkit.org/media/files/757/982/dynmap-1.9.1.jar
```

Once enabled, a web-based map of the server will be available at
[localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123). James Fryman's
[nginx module](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/jfryman/nginx) could then
be used to proxy the server through
[map.domain.tld](http://map.domain.tld) like thus:

```puppet
nginx::resource::vhost { 'map.domain.tld':
  proxy            => 'http://localhost:8123',
  proxy_set_header => [ 'Host $host' ],
}
```

Or again in Hiera,

```yaml
nginx::nginx_vhosts:
  map.domain.tld:
    proxy: http://localhost:8123
    proxy_set_header:
      - Host $host
```

Note that Nginx setup is not within the scope of this module, and is
simply provided as a tip.

### Rcon Example
rcon can be enabled to subsequently access the server's console.

```puppet
class{'minecraft':
  enable_rcon   => true,
  rcon_port     => 1234,
  rcon_password => 'foo',
}
```

A [rcon client](http://wiki.vg/RCON) e.g [mcrcon](https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon) can be used to connect.

```bash
# ./mcrcon  -c -H 127.0.0.1 -P 25575 -p 1234 -t
Logged in. Type ""Q"" to quit!
```

## Caveats

This package uses
[Puppetlabs' stdlib module](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib)
for the `ensure_resource` function, which it uses on the `screen`
package (utilized for running the Minecraft server as a background
service). This is currently the safest way to declare a
possibly-conflicting dependency.

## Testing

Testing of this package occurs on an Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS machine, using
Puppet 3.4.3. This is made easy using
[vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), and my own
[box](https://vagrantcloud.com/andschwa/ubuntu-precise-latest-puppet).

minecraft-pi allows you to control a [Minecraft: Pi Edition](http://pi.minecraft.net/) server from Node.js. This is intended as a lower-level module, and is meant to be extended on for bigger projects. However, the commands are simple enough to play with as-is.

### Usage

```js
var Minecraft = require('minecraft-pi');
var client = new Minecraft('localhost', 4711, function() {
	// Use the client variable to play with the server!
	client.chat('Yo dawg, I heard you like Node.js, so I put some Node.js in your Pi so you can Node.js while you Pi.');
	client.setBlock(3, 14, 15, client.blocks['DIAMOND_BLOCK']);
});
```

## About this image

This Docker image allows you to run a Vanilla Minecraft server quickly. It
also serves as the base image for some of my Modded Minecraft server images.


## Available Tags

* `java15`, `latest` - the default. Uses Shenandoah GC by default for low latency.
* `java8` - used by certain modpacks, or for people who know what they are doing.
* `java7` - for backward compatibility with older Minecraft versions.


## How to use this image


### Starting an instance

    docker run \
        --name minecraft-instance \
        -p 0.0.0.0:25565:25565 \
        -d \
        -it \
        -e DEFAULT_OP=dinnerbone \
        -e MINECRAFT_EULA=true \
        dlord/minecraft

By default, this starts up a Minecraft 1.8.8 server instance. If you wish to
start a different Minecraft server version, you need to set the
`MINECRAFT_VERSION` variable to the appropriate version.

You must set the `DEFAULT_OP` variable on startup. This should be your
Minecraft username. The container will fail to run if this is not set.

When starting a Minecraft server, you must agree to the terms stated in
Minecraft's EULA. This can be done by setting the `MINECRAFT_EULA` variable
to `true`. Without this, the server will not run.

This image exposes the standard minecraft port (25565).

When starting a container for the first time, it will check for the existence of
the Minecraft Server jar file, and will download from Mojang when necessary. As
much as I want to package the Minecraft server jar in this image (to also save
on time and the hassle of an extra step), I cannot due to the [Minecraft EULA][].

It is highly preferred to start the container with `-it`. This is needed in
order to allow executing console commands via `docker exec`. This also allows
the Minecraft server to safely shutdown when stopping the container via
`docker stop`. See the `Scripting` section for more details.


### Commands

The image uses an entrypoint script called `minecraft`, which allows you to
execute preset commands. Should you attempt to execute an unrecognized command,
it will treat it as a regular shell command.

The commands are as follows:

* `run` - This runs the Minecraft server, and is the default command used by the
  container. This command can accept additional parameters (_if_ minecraft
  supports other options apart from `nogui`). Useful when
  creating a new container via `docker create` or `docker run`
* `permissions` - This updates the permissions of all related files and
  folders. Useful when manually editing a file.
* `console` - This executes a console command. This allows system administrators
  to perform complex tasks via scripts. This feature is off by default. See the
  `Scripting` section for more details and examples.

Here are some examples on how to use these commands:

**run - pass anotherminecraftoptionthatdoesnotexist to minecraft server**

    docker run \
        --name minecraft-instance \
        -p 0.0.0.0:25565:25565 \
        -d \
        -it \
        -e DEFAULT_OP=dinnerbone \
        -e MINECRAFT_EULA=true \
        dlord/minecraft
        run anotherminecraftoptionthatdoesnotexist

**permissions - update file and folder permissions while a container is running**

    docker exec minecraft-instance minecraft permissions


### Scripting

Unlike other Minecraft Docker Images, this image provides a way to execute
console commands without attaching to the docker container. It lets system
administrators perform much more complex tasks, such as managing the docker
container from another docker container (e.g. deploying using Jenkins).

For those who are used to running `docker attach` inside a `screen` or `tmux`
session for scripting, this is going to be heaven.

This feature can be enabled by pasing the `-it` parameter to `docker create` or
`docker run`, which enables STDIN and TTY. This runs the Minecraft server inside
a `tmux` session. This also enables safe shutdown mode when the container is
stopped.

Once enabled, you may now execute console commands like so:

    docker exec minecraft-instance minecraft console say hello everybody!

Some warnings when using this feature:

* **DO NOT USE `-it` ON `docker exec`!** For some reason, it crashes
  the `tmux` session that drives this feature.
* **Be careful when attaching to the console via `docker attach`**. You are
  attaching to a `tmux` session running on the foreground with the footer
  disabled. Do not try to detach from the `tmux` session using `CTRL-b d`,
  otherwise this will stop the container. To detach from the container, use
  `CTRL-p CTRL-q`, which is the standard escape sequence for `docker attach`.

Here is an example on how to notify players that the server will be shutdown
after 60 seconds:

    #!/bin/bash
    docker exec minecraft-instance minecraft console say We will be shutting down the server in 60s!
    docker exec minecraft-instance minecraft console say Stop whatever you are doing!
    sleep 60
    docker exec minecraft-instance minecraft console say We will be back in 1 hour!
    sleep 5

    # The container will send the stop console command to the server for you, to
    # ensure that the server is shutdown safely.
    #
    # Of course you can run this manually like so:
    #
    #     docker exec minecraft-instance minecraft console stop
    #
    # But this will restart the container if the restart policy is set to always.
    docker stop -t 60 minecraft-instance


### Data volumes

Previously, this image has one data volume: `/var/lib/minecraft`. This volume
used to contain world data. If you are using an older version of this docker
image, you will need to move the contents of this folder to `/opt/minecraft`.

The decision to change this was due to the way Vanilla Minecraft works.

Unlike Spigot, which is capable of changing the location of the world data,
Vanilla Minecraft (and by extension, Modded Minecraft), does not play nice with
this. Even though they technically support it, mods and other sysads expect the
world data to reside inside the main Minecraft folder.

And when you try to support both vanilla and modded servers, it becomes more
complex. Vanilla servers will have 3 world folders (e.g. `world`,
`world_nether`, `world_the_end`), while modded servers will only have `world`.

To keep things simple, I've removed the data volume definition. It is now up to
the user to declare the appropriate data volume either at runtime, or when
extending the image.

If you're running a Vanilla server, you may opt to declare `/opt/minecraft` as a
data volume. This not only simplifies data management, it allows you to take
advantage of the `ONBUILD` trigger that comes with this image. See the
`ONBUILD Trigger` section for details.


### Environment Variables

The image uses environment variables to configure the JVM settings and the
server.properties.


#### `MINECRAFT_EULA`

`MINECRAFT_EULA` is required when starting creating a new container. You need to
agree to Minecraft's EULA before you can start the Minecraft server.


#### `DEFAULT_OP`

`DEFAULT_OP` is required when starting creating a new container.


#### `MINECRAFT_OPTS`

You may adjust the JVM settings via the `MINECRAFT_OPTS` variable.


#### Environment variables for server.properties

On startup, it will check the existence of `server.properties`. If it does
not exist, one will be created for you. You may override the defaults by
setting the appropriate environment variable.

Each entry in the `server.properties` file can be changed by passing the
appropriate variable. To make it easier to remember and configure, the variable
representation of each entry is in uppercase, and uses underscore instead
of dash.

The server port cannot be changed. This has to be remapped when starting an
instance.

For reference, here is the list of environment variables for `server.properties`
that you can set:

* GENERATOR_SETTINGS
* OP_PERMISSION_LEVEL
* ALLOW_NETHER
* LEVEL_NAME
* ENABLE_QUERY
* ALLOW_FLIGHT
* ANNOUNCE_PLAYER_ACHIEVEMENTS
* LEVEL_TYPE
* ENABLE_RCON
* FORCE_GAMEMODE
* LEVEL_SEED
* SERVER_IP
* MAX_BUILD_HEIGHT
* SPAWN_NPCS
* WHITE_LIST
* SPAWN_ANIMALS
* SNOOPER_ENABLED
* ONLINE_MODE
* RESOURCE_PACK
* PVP
* DIFFICULTY
* ENABLE_COMMAND_BLOCK
* PLAYER_IDLE_TIMEOUT
* GAMEMODE
* MAX_PLAYERS
* SPAWN_MONSTERS
* VIEW_DISTANCE
* GENERATE_STRUCTURES
* MOTD


## Extending this image

This image is meant to be extended for packaging custom maps, modpacks, and
configurations as Docker images. For server owners, this is the best way to
roll out configuration changes and updates to your servers.

If you wish to do so, here are some of the things you will need to know:

This Docker image contains one `ONBUILD` trigger, which copies any local files
to `/usr/src/minecraft`.

When a container is started for the first time, the contents of this folder is
copied to `/opt/minecraft` via `rsync`, except for anything that starts with
`world`.


### World Templates

This Docker image supports the use of world templates, which is useful for
packaging custom maps. World templates should always start with `world`, which
has been a standard Minecraft convention (e.g. world, world_nether,
world_the_end). Copy your world templates to `/usr/src/minecraft` via the
`ONBUILD` trigger. During startup, it will check if `/opt/minecraft/world` is
empty. If so, it will create a copy of the world template on this folder.


### Environment Variables in Dockerfile


#### `MINECRAFT_HOME` (Read-only!)

To make your life simple, this variable points to where Minecraft is installed.
This points to `/opt/minecraft`. Useful for creating scripts when packaging
modpacks.

**DO NOT OVERRIDE THIS. CHANGES TO THIS VARIABLE ARE IGNORED!**


#### `MINECRAFT_VERSION`

Modpacks will require a specific Minecraft version in order to work. This can
be done setting the `MINECRAFT_VERSION` in your Dockerfile.


#### `MINECRAFT_STARTUP_JAR`

When packaging a modpack, you will need to start the server using a different
jar file. To specify the startup jar, set the `MINECRAFT_STARTUP_JAR` variable
in your Dockerfile.


#### `MINECRAFT_OPTS`

Some modpacks have their own recommended JVM settings. You can include them
via the `MINECRAFT_OPTS` variable in your Dockerfile.


## Supported Docker versions

This image has been tested on Docker version 1.1.1.

[![banner](livemessage.png?raw=true)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlEzqEKURYY)

**[Check out the trailer video here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlEzqEKURYY)**

Livemessage is a client-sided DM manager for Minecraft 1.12.2. It is inspired by older chat applications such as AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger.

Livemessage stores DMs locally and only sends messages through the Minecraft server (**with the /msg command**) - no messages are sent through or to any other server. **This means you can chat with people who do not use this mod.**

# Features
 - Persistent message history (saved to disk)
 - Notification toast and sounds (configurable)
 - Different gorgeous colors for every chat
 - Separate chat windows for separate DMs
 - Dates and timestamps for messages
 - Buddy list
 - Online status
 - Friends
 - Blocked users
 - Hide default DM messages from main chat (configurable)
 - Works out of the box on 2b2t.org, Constantiam, papermc and many other servers
 - Configurable DM detecting regex for servers that are not supported yet
 - Shift-right-click on a player to open up a chat in-game (disabled by default)

# Planned features
 - Friends import from other mods and clients (ForgeHax, Impact, Future etc)
 - Select and copy text from chat history
 - Get previous/next sent message with up/down
 - Click on links
 - Search (CTRL+F)

# FAQ
### How do I open the GUI?
The default keybind to open the GUI is *CTRL+T*, but this can be changed in the Minecraft controls.

### How do I change GUI size?
You can change the GUI size in the mod settings.

### Where are chats saved?
`.minecraft/config/livemessage/messages/`

### How do I add custom regex?
Open up the files in `.minecraft/config/livemessage/patterns/` and add your regex, one per line. toPatterns are for messages *you* send and fromPatterns are for messages *you* receive.  
Your regex should look something like this: `^From (\w{3,16}): (.*)` where the first group is the from username and second group is the message itself.

### Does this mod hide DM messages from the vanilla chat?
By default, it only hides chat DMs from blocked users. You can change the settings to hide DM messages from other users as well to make the vanilla chat cleaner. Livechat never hides any non-DM messages from vanilla chat

639,MinecraftForkage/MinecraftForkage,Java,"Components
==========

Minecraft Forkage consists of several components:

* The **core** is a modified version of Minecraft.
    * The core has a complicated build process in order to work around not being allowed to distribute Minecraft;
        several miscellaneous **build tools** are required to build it.
    * We can't distribute the source code for the core, so instead we distribute a deterministic decompiler, and **patches**
        to its output.
    * We also can't distribute the binary for the core, so instead the core's build process generates an **installer**
        which re-generates it at runtime, based on a bytecode patch. 
* The **packer** takes the core (either one you built from this repository, or one re-generated by the installer)
    and a list of mods, and outputs a **modpack** JAR.
* Modpack JARs are modified versions of the game, which *should* (barring bugs) be completely standalone.
    * They cannot be distributed either. Instead, modpack creators are recommended to distribute packer configuration files.

Core build tools
================

This component resides in the `core-BuildTools/` directory.

It can be built by running `ant` in that directory, which will yield the file `core-BuildTools/build/BuildTools.jar`.

As a convenience for editing, the directory `core-BuildTools/` may be imported as a project into Eclipse. It should require no
further setup.

Note: the Eclipse project references a bundled copy of Ant 1.9.4, but the Ant build script will use your installed version of Ant.



Core
====

This component resides in the `core/` directory. This directory may be imported into Eclipse as a project.

The build process is complex by necessity, since we are not allowed to distribute the original or modified Minecraft code --
only patches to it. This means we may not distribute the full source code for the core (although it can be generated) nor the
full binary.

To generate the source code, run `ant extractsrc` in the `core/` directory.
You need an Internet connection to run this step for the first time, as it downloads Minecraft and several libraries.

To generate the binary, run `ant recompile` in the `core/` directory.

To generate the installer, run `ant make-installer` in the `core/` directory. The installer contains only bytecode patches to
Minecraft, as well as new code, and can be distributed. End-users can run the installer to re-generate the binary.

Note: the binary produced by the installer is not expected to be byte-wise identical to the binary produced by ""ant recompile"".

Note: the core is compiled as Java 1.6.

Note: any modifications you make to files in the vanilla-src *will be lost* next time they are regenerated from patches (with
`ant extractsrc`)




Packer
======

This component resides in the `packer/` directory. This directory may be imported into Eclipse as a project.

The packer relies on some of the libraries downloaded by running `ant extractsrc` in `core/`. This may be fixed in the future.
For now, you need to do that if you want to be able to compile the packer.

To build the packer, run `ant` in the `packer/` directory, or use your favourite IDE.



Libraries
=========

External libraries for both Minecraft and Forge will be downloaded to `core/libraries/` when you run `ant extractsrc`.
The folder structure is not preserved - all the library JARs are simply dumped into that directory.
Natives will be extracted to `core/libraries/natives/`.


User-friendliness layer
=======================

Users want Forkage modpacks to just work. Telling users to mess around with command lines or directory structures is a good way to not have any users :)

Users can either generate a *standalone modpack JAR*, or use the vanilla launcher.

## Standalone JARs

Supplying the --standalone, --libraryDir and --nativesDir options to the command-line packer will cause it to emit a
standalone JAR file. Note that many mods rely on the current working directory being the instance directory.

Launching the standalone JAR is platform-specific; on Windows, it must be placed in the instance directory and then
double-clicked, or a shortcut can be made to it.

Note that standalone JARs contain Mojang code, and may contain open-source code in a manner not compliant with its license (as the licenses have not been reviewed for this purpose); therefore, they should not be 

TODO: improve the login interface, and make it save sessions/profiles in a way compatible with the vanilla launcher.

For now, it does not download assets, so the vanilla launcher must have been used at least once for this Minecraft version.

For now, it does not download libraries. This is a problem - the packer must have the libraries all placed in one directory, and natives extracted, and it requires those two directories to be specified on the command line. None of this is user-friendly.

## Vanilla launcher

When using the vanilla launcher, the user should be able to set up a profile by selecting the Forkage version as the Minecraft
version, and then selecting the instance directory - exactly the same as for Forge instances.

To accomplish this, the *packer* is registered with the launcher. When the user launches Minecraft, the installer will
quickly check if any mods have changed. If so, it will re-generate the modpack JAR. Then, it will launch the modpack JAR.
The installer will be registered with all of the required libraries and assets, so that the launcher will handle downloading them.

A dynamic lights mod for Fabric.

## 📖 What's this mod?

It's dark outside, extremely dark...
You can't see a lot in the darkness, you wish you had a torch,
or a lantern to hold and see in the light...

And this is now possible with this mod as it adds dynamic lights to the game.
You can see in the darkness thanks to your torch now!

This mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft. Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an
item which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)

Searching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754)

## ✅ Features:

- Dynamic lights.
- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.
- Works with some modded items.
- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!
- Magma cubes emit light.
- Spectral arrows emit light.
- Burning entities emit light.
- Blazes emit light.
- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.
- Quick and simple API for developers.
- And more!

## Screenshots

### Items emit light

Dropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!

### Configuration GUI

As of v2.1.0.

![Configuration GUI](images/settings_main.png)
![Entities Configuration](images/settings_entities.png)

## 📖 Usage

Using this mod is very simple!

Install it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).

You will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!
You can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.

<!-- modrinth_exclude.start -->
### Build

Just do `./gradlew shadowRemapJar` and everything should build just fine!
<!-- modrinth_exclude.end -->

## 📖 How does it work internally?

Check [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).

## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?

Check [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).

# 📖 Compatibility

- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.
- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.
- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**

641,preston4896/Minecraft-NFT-Server,JavaScript,"# Minecraft-NFT-Server
A Minecraft server world where players can buy and sell virtual land, items and other cosmetic goods, and build a thriving in game economy.

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/preston4896/Minecraft-NFT-Server)
![build](https://travis-ci.org/preston4896/Minecraft-NFT-Server.svg?branch=main)

## Goals
- Create a NFT based ecosystem based on an open world game.
- Using a popular game like minecraft to tap into gaming audiences, younger and older alike, to introduce them to Sperax.
- Implementing a DAO like governance of the server to allow for better community management.
- Creating a functioning virtual economy based on a Sperax powered fungible token, allowing players to trade in game virtual currency for Sperax coins.
- Implementing a unique system of “lending” NFT items by putting up collateral fungible tokens with a DeFi based model.

## Project Structure

├── README.md
├── front-end
├── smart-contracts
│   ├── DeFi.sol
│   ├── ERC1155.sol
│   ├── Governance.sol
│   └── Minting.sol
└── tests
```
## Components
#### NFTs
The NFTs used for this project would be a custom set of tools, weapons, armor, and cosmetic items that would be unobtainable in normal minecraft gameplay, which could be then traded, bought or sold.

#### Economy
The Project aims to have a self-regulated economy where the players would really decide the value of a certain Non Fungible token in terms of the virtual currency. Having this economy could introduce specialization on the server, where players could offer their minecraft skills in exchange for the fungible tokens

#### DeFi
DeFi is one of the hot topics in the blockchain space right now, and the project aims to integrate NFT based DeFi lending within this Minecraft Server economy. Basically, players can ""lend"" their NFT tokens to other players on putting up a collateral, in exchange for a small amount of interest.

#### Staking
The project aims to add a staking mechanism where players would be able to stake their fungible tokens to earn something like the MEME Project's pineapple points, which would be used to redeem NFT tokens.

#### Governance
The projects wishes to emulate a DAO like structure where players can control the decisions taken by the project by voting on proposed updates via a governance token. The top 100 owners of governance tokens would be allowed to add proposals, and community members holding governance tokens (earned by partipiating in minting and DeFi) would quadratically vote on them.

## Smart Contracts

![alt text](blob/image.png)

#### ERC1155.sol
This contract will create the Non Fungible and Fungible Assets of this project, which would then be available to the other smart-contracts that are a part of the project. It will also be responsible for the creation of the porject's governance token.

#### Minting.sol
This contract will allow users to stake their fungible in game tokens in order to mint NFT tokens for in-game items/land. This smart contract would be similar to MEME wherein the user will earn something like ‘pineapple points’ and at a set number of pineapple tokens, he/she can redeem those for an NFT token.

#### DeFi.sol
This contract would be a peer-to-peer lending contract where a lender will lend his/her NFT token at a price he/she sees fit, and this NFT token will be kept in an escrow. The borrower will have access to the token but would have to pay a certain interest in order to retain access to this token. In the event that the borrower is unable to pay interest, the NFT will be transferred back to the lender.

#### Governance.sol
The governance smart contract will be similar to a DAO smart contract allowing governance token holders to vote on a proposal proposed by one of the top 100 governance token holders, and vote on the direction the community takes. The voting would be such that the amount of value assigned to a vote of a governance token older would be the square root of the amount of tokens held by him/her, thereby reducing the influence of whales on the vote.

## Interface

"
643,codys/minecraft.print,Python,"---WHAT IS THIS?---
Minecraft.Print() is a python library for converting defined regions of Minecraft levels to a 3D Printable format.


---REQUIREMENTS/SETUP---
python    - (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/)
numpy     - (http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/OldFiles/ or http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
pyyaml    - (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML)
pymclevel - (already included)


---INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE---
Step One:
    Build something awesome in Minecraft.

Step Two:
    Define the space you wish to print by placing two markers, in-game. The marker configuration is a diamond block, followed by a gold block, followed by an iron block in vertical order (ascending or descending). The coordinates of the diamond block will be used as the marker.

Step Three Point One:
    Ensure that the save file is in your normal single player directory (this step really only matters if you are trying to process an SMP level).
    Windows - C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves
    Mac     - [username]/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves
    Linux   - /home/[username]/.minecraft/saves

Step Three Point Magic:
    Run the following command from the terminal, replacing [level_name] and [output_name] with the level you wish to process and the desired output file name. The script will then run and save the STL file in the same directory. Note: the script does not need to be in the same folder as your save files (it knows where to find them).
    Windows         - ""run.py [level_name] [output_name]""
    Mac or Linux    - ""python run.py [level_name] [output_name]""


---VIEWING AN STL FILE---
MeshLab - http://meshlab.sourceforge.net


---PRINTING---
Option One:
    Print the STL file using a 3D Printer that you have access to.

Option Two:
    Use an online service that will allow you to upload an STL file and order a print. 
    Examples - cloudfab.com and shapeways.com


---SHOWING OFF YOUR CREATIONS---
We figure you already know how to do this.


---SHARING YOUR CREATIONS---
So here's the deal. We want to see what awesome stuff you guys are going to print. So drop us a line at hi@minecraftprint.com and let us know how it went. Also, if you have something really awesome, consider putting the model up on thingiverse.com for others to see and print.

Antique Atlas is a book that acts like a map featuring infinite scrolling, zoom and custom labeled markers. The map is generated around the player by calculating the average biome in each 16x16 chunk.

Navigate the map by dragging it with the mouse, clicking arrow buttons or pressing arrow keys on the keyboard. Use the +/- keys or mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

You can export the map of the current dimension into a PNG image, see buttons on the right side of the GUI.

You can edit the configs to set which biome uses what texture, or even assign your own textures to any biome, including custom mod biomes. See tutorial on the wiki: https://github.com/Hunternif/AntiqueAtlas/wiki/Editing-Textures

### API
If you are a mod developer and you wish to interact with AntiqueAtlas, you will need the source code of the API. You can include the whole source code of AntiqueAtlas (the `...-sources.jar` in [Releases](https://github.com/Hunternif/AntiqueAtlas/releases)) which allows you to test the  interaction when debugging your mod.

Use the class `hunternif.mc.atlas.api.AtlasAPI` to obtain a reference to the API. There are 2 actual APIs: TileAPI and MarkerAPI. See javadocs/sources and the wiki for more: https://github.com/Hunternif/AntiqueAtlas/wiki/API

## Introduction

**Leafish** is an open-source re-implementation of Minecraft.
The game is a open-world sandbox where players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks.
The game has various game modes including survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources and access to flight.

Minecraft is originally written by Mojang in Java for PC, but nowadays also has a so-called ""Bedrock edition"" which has ports to various alternative platforms.
Leafish attempts to provide everything from the Java-edition and tries to be compatible with it so you can join regular servers and play alongside people using the official Java-based clients.
Being written in Rust with support for modern graphic API's like Vulkan means performance improvements and enhancements that are not possible in the original game.
It's also completely community driven!

Note that currently not everything from the original game is supported yet so Leafish can't currently be seen as a fully fledged alternative.
A list of missing features is available on the [issues page](https://github.com/Lea-fish/Leafish/issues).

## Version support

| Symbol | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| ✓      | All features supported |
| -      | Protocol supported (so the client can join servers using the version) but various missing features |

| Game version | Protocol version | Supported? |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- |
| 1.16.5 | 754 | - |
| 1.16.4 | 754 | - |
| 1.16.3 | 753 | - |
| 1.16.2 | 751 | - |
| 1.16.1 | 736 | - |
| 1.16 | 735 | - |
| 1.15.2 | 578 | - |
| 1.15.1 | 575 | - |
| 1.14.4 | 498 | - |
| 1.14.3 | 490 | - |
| 1.14.2 | 485 | - |
| 1.14.1 | 480 | - |
| 1.14 | 477 | - |
| 1.13.2 | 404 | - |
| 1.12.2 | 340 | - |
| 1.11.2 | 316 | - |
| 1.11   | 315 | - |
| 1.10.2 | 210 | - |
| 1.9.2  | 109 | - |
| 1.9    | 107 | - |
| 1.8.9  | 47  | - |
| 1.7.10 | 5   | - |

Leafish is designed to support multiple protocol versions, so that client development is not in lock-step with the server version.
The level of support varies, but the goal is to support major versions from 1.7.10 up to the current latest major version.
Occasionally, snapshots are also supported.

Forge servers are supported on 1.7.10 - 1.12.2 (FML) and 1.13.2 - 1.16.5 (FML2).

Support for older protocols will _not_ be dropped as newer protocols are added.

## Getting the game

### Downloading a pre-built version

Since there currently is no release yet, pre-built binaries have to be downloaded from Github Actions.
The latest actions can always be seen [here](https://github.com/Lea-fish/Leafish/actions).
Click on a workflow run from the main branch and download the artifact for your platform.

### Building the game

#### Dependencies

Rust stable version 1.53.0 or newer is required.

**Debian/Ubuntu**

As current Debian stable (Bullseye) has a rust version below the required one, you need to either update from an external source, or consider using Debian Testing (Bookworm) for example.  
For Ubuntu you might want to use the -updates repository for your version.
```
# apt install cargo libssl-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libgtk-3-dev
```

**Alpine Linux**

You have to enable the community repository for `cargo`.
```
# apk add cargo openssl-dev xcb-util-dev gtk+3.0-dev
```

**Arch Linux and derivates**

```
# pacman -S rust python3 pkgconf openssl xcb-util gtk3
```

#### Building

Make sure you're in the root of the Git repository before running the following commands.

Compile and run:

```sh
$ cargo run --release
```

Just compile:

```sh
$ cargo build --release
```

#### Running

Double-clicking the game should be enough to run Leafish, which will bring up a login screen followed by a server list from which you can select a server.
If nothing happens consider running the executable from the command-line, `./leafish` and see if any errors come up.

## Contributing

A list of bugs and missing features can be found on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Lea-fish/Leafish/issues/).
Feel free to work on any bug and submit a pull request to the `main` branch with the fix.
Mentioning that you intend to fix a bug on the issue will prevent other people from trying as well and makes sure no duplicated work is done.

### New features

Please talk to the Leafish team first before starting to develop a new feature.
We first and foremost try to make the game feature complete compared to the vanilla Java edition and except for very specific things these should be prioritized.
Therefor contacting us will allow us to help you or prevent you from wasting any time.
You can talk to us via Matrix and/or Discord, see links at the top of this page.

this isnt my code, and it doesnt work

if you want this to work, you will need to reverse engineer the client code to make a server, which wouldn't be easy. If you're up for a challenge and want to try to make a server, head to the client javascript and good luck!

This is also missing assets like textures, because at the time I made this I didnt know how to pull the assets out of it, and even now at the time of making the readme, I'm still not sure how to go about it. If you want a version with textures, go check out [RealSunCat's Reversed Minecraft Classic](https://github.com/RealTheSunCat/Minecraft-Classic-Reversed)

## ❗ What's this?!
**CameraOverhaul** a clientside Minecraft mod that attempts to improve overall satisfaction of the game through the introduction of various camera rotations, to emphasize on the player's movement and improve visual feedback. Strafing and turning around will tilt the camera sideways. Jumping, falling, and moving forward/backwards will affect the camera's pitch.

### Info:
- **Available** at [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/cameraoverhaul) & [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cameraoverhaul);
- **Made** for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) & [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org);
- **Requires** [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config);
- **Supports** Minecraft versions from `1.14` to `1.19.3` and up, releases are version-agnostic;
- Works best at high framerates - [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight), [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium), and other [optimization mods](https://modrinth.com/mods?f=categories%3A%27optimization%27) are **recommended**.

## ⚙️ Can I turn off X and only keep Y?
You can use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) (or an alternative of your choosing) to configure the mod in-game.

You can also manually find the configuration file with intensity scaling for all features at<br/>
`.minecraft/config/cameraoverhaul.json`.

Set any factor to `0.0` to turn its feature off.<br/>
Negative numbers are also usually legal, allowing inverting effects, if that's your thing.

It should copy the plugin to ~/.wireshark/plugins, and then loading a wireshark packet dump should decode the packet types.

When I tested, I used a tcpdump with full packets, I'd recommend the same or things will probably break.

# TimoCloud
TimoCloud is a Minecraft server/proxy management system (""Cloud System""). It will care about keeping online enough servers/proxies of every kind. But it's more than that. Thank to its algorithms, you'll never have to care again about servers or resources. TimoCloud automatically chooses servers with low CPU usage and enough available RAM to start your instances. And its integrated *Flow*-System makes updating templates easier than ever before: Edit one file in a server template, and the update will automatically be deployed to all bases (a.k.a. ""Wrapper""). But of course, only the changed files will get updated.

## Features
TimoCloud is full of innovative features. Here is a list of the most important ones:

 - **Automatic and dynamic starting** of Minecraft servers and BungeeCord/Velocity proxies - depending on the current online player amount.
 - **Automatic and dynamic selection** of a virtual machine (server) with **enough available resources** for an instance which is getting started.
 - **Powerful API**, synchronized over your whole network in real-time, also offering async methods with callbacks. Everything that can be done via commands also has a corresponding API method.
 - **Secure Communication**: TimoCloud uses RSA and AES encryption to securely communicate between Core, Bases, servers and proxies
 - **High efficiency**: Efficiency is one of our major goals: While using powerful software such as *screen* and *Netty*, TimoCloud tries to keep your servers' resource usage as little as possible
 - **Multi-Root**: Use one *TimoCloudCore* instance in combination with as many bases (a.k.a. ""Wrapper"") as you want. 
 - **Multi-Proxy**: TimoCloud is standalone and does not only start Bukkit/Spigot servers for you, but also BungeeCord/Velocity proxies
 - **Beautiful, live-updating sign system**: Use the integrated server join sign system to let players access all your servers. Signs are dynamic - that means only _free_ servers will be displayed - and can be animated.

656,metadaddy/Forcecraft,Java,"Forcecraft
==========

This Minecraft mod visualizes [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/) Accounts, Opportunities and Contacts. Forcecraft adds a new dimension to Minecraft, where each Account in your Salesforce environment (aka 'org') is represented by a building, comprising a level for each Opportunity associated with that Account.

![Forcecraft](http://metadaddy.github.io/Forcecraft/Forcecraft.png)

Levers on each level represent and control the Opportunity Stage Name; updating an Opportunity's Stage Name outside Minecraft will cause the lever state to update within the Minecraft world, while throwing the lever in Minecraft will update the Opportunity's Stage Name.

![Opportunity Levers](http://metadaddy.github.io/Forcecraft/OpportunityLevers.png)

Each Salesforce Contact is represented by a Villager-derived entity, with the Contact name shown as a custom name tag above the entity's head. 

![Contact](http://metadaddy.github.io/Forcecraft/Contact.png)

Interacting with a Contact (right-click, by default) will show the Chatter feed for that Contact and allow you to post to the feed. Similarly, Account and Opportunity signs give access to the respective Chatter feeds.

![Contact Feed](http://metadaddy.github.io/Forcecraft/ContactFeed.png)

If an Opportunity's Stage Name is updated to 'Closed Won', a Contact from the associated Account will teleport to the player and give the player items to the 'value' of the opportunity. If, on the other hand, an Opportunity's Stage Name is updated to 'Closed Lost', the weather will take a turn for the worse!

Take a look at the mod in action:

[![YouTube video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/eb3GgM1o_8I/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb3GgM1o_8I)

<a name=""update0.2.1""></a>UPDATE (version 0.2.1) : if you define a custom object, `Vegetable`, in your Salesforce environment, the corresponding item will appear in the game when a record is created. The `Vegetable` object must include the following fields:

* A picklist field named `Type` with values `Flower`, `Carrot` and `Potato`
* A number field named `Quantity`

If the `Vegetable` object exists, Forcecraft will automatically listen for updates.

Running the mod
---------------

### Pre-requisites

* [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) 1.7.2. [Download the Minecraft Launcher](https://minecraft.net/download), edit your profile, and select version 1.7.2.
* [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) - I've been using 10.12.1.1060 - later versions *may* also work. Download the [Forge Installer](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.7.2-10.12.1.1060/forge-1.7.2-10.12.1.1060-installer.jar) and run it (select 'Install Client') to create a Forge profile in the Minecraft launcher. Select the Forge profile.
* [The mod binary](http://metadaddy.github.io/Forcecraft/Forcecraft-v0.2.3.jar) - Download it and drop it into the Minecraft mods directory. On a Mac, this is `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods`; on Windows it is `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods`.
* A Salesforce org. [Create a free Force.com Developer Edition](http://developer.force.com/join) if you are new to Salesforce and want to try out Forcecraft.

**IMPORTANT** You MUST create a configuration file with your account credentials so that Forcecraft can authenticate to Salesforce. Use this as a template:

```
# Configuration file

####################
# general
####################

general {
    I:dimensionId=7
    S:loginHost=login.salesforce.com
    S:username=user@example.com    
    S:password=p455w0rd
}
```

Edit this, and save it as

* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/config/Forcecraft.cfg`
* Windows: `%appdata%/.minecraft/config/Forcecraft.cfg`

You MUST edit the username and password entries. If you are using a Salesforce sandbox, change the loginHost to test.salesforce.com.

Run Minecraft and select the Forge profile. If all is well, you should see Forcecraft listed on the Mods screen. Start Minecraft as a single player and create a new world, in creative mode.

![Create New World](http://metadaddy.github.io/Forcecraft/CreateNewWorld.png)

Once the game starts, you can type `/login` to teleport to the Forcecraft dimension. Type `/logout` to return to the default 'Overworld' dimension.

**Note** - if you're demoing the mod, you probably want to stop the game from pausing when you switch away to the browser or another app. To do this, edit options.txt

* If you're running via Eclipse (see below), it's at `<forge dir>/eclipse/options.txt`
* If you're running 'standalone' on a Mac, it's at `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/options.txt`. On Windows, it's at `%appdata%\.minecraft`.

Look for the line that reads

    pauseOnLostFocus:true

Change true to false.

Building the mod
----------------

### Pre-requisites

Minecraft, etc, as listed above, under 'Running the mod'. You will need the [Minecraft Forge 10.12.1.1060 source distribution](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.7.2-10.12.1.1060/forge-1.7.2-10.12.1.1060-src.zip). Follow the [installation process](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Source).

### Getting the source

Fetch the Forcecraft repo into the Forge root directory (the `forge/` directory created during zip extraction) like this:

	cd forge
	git init
	git remote add origin https://github.com/metadaddy/Forcecraft.git
	git fetch
	rm build.gradle src/main/resources/mcmod.info
	git checkout -t origin/master

### Building the mod

    gradle build

The build process creates `build/distributions/Forcecraft-1.7.2-0.2.3-mod.jar`. This is an [uber-jar](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11947093/33905) including all the mod's dependencies, packaged so that Forge will load it correctly.

You should be able to drop this into the mods directory to play the mod with Minecraft + Forge.

### Debugging the mod

Create the Eclipse project:

    gradle eclipse

Build the mod jar (see above). In the Eclipse Project Explorer, open the `build/libs` folder, select `Forcecraft-1.7.2-0.2.2-dep.jar`, right click, and select 'Build Path | Add to Build Path'. This jar file contains all the dependencies that Eclipse needs.

Follow the instructions in the 'Running the mod' section above to configure the mod, except that the configuration file needs to be at `/<forge dir>/eclipse/config/Forcecraft.cfg`.

In Eclipse, you can use the 'Run' or 'Debug' button as appropriate.

657,CarbonNeuron/AIBot,Java,"# AIBot
An automated bot for the game Minecraft.

__Note: This is *NOT* for Minecraft 1.8 or above__

# Getting Started

### Required Arguments
When running the bot, you __must__ supply the following arguments:

`-b` or `--bot` - This must be supplied before you give any other arguments.

`-u` or `--username` - This is the username that the bot will use (what is used when you log into the Minecraft Client)

`-s` or `--server` - This is the server you want the bot to connect to (can use ports, just add : then the port number).

`--protocol` - The protocol version the bot should use (1.7 servers use protocol 4)

If you are connecting to an offline server you must add the argument `-O`(capital o) or `--offline` otherwise you must specify the account password with `-p` or `--password` (The password is what you enter into the Minecraft client when loggin in).

### Regular Users

If you don't want to modify the code in any way, then read this to get started.

1. Download the binary files for the [latest release of the project.](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/AIBot/releases)
2. Run the JAR file using the command line or batch/bash file
   1. Use `java -jar AIBot.jar -b --help` for a list of all available arguments

If you're on windows, I've created a [simple batch file](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/AIBot/blob/master/start_bot.bat) that you can use to run the bot quickly, just make sure you change the values in the file to suite your needs.

### Developers
1. Download a copy of the repo to your development workspace using the methods you want (e.g. eGit, SourceTree, GitHub GUI).
2. Now, make sure that the project is shown in your workspace.
3. Make sure you add the `/lib` directory to the project.
4. To build the project, run the file `build.xml` as an ant build file

Enjoy!

<a href=""https://colab.research.google.com/github/thecoder-001/MineColab/blob/master/MineColab.ipynb"" target=""_parent""><img align=""right"" src=""https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"" alt=""Open In Colab""></a>

## :hear_no_evil:  First of all, what is google Colab?
As the official FAQ says, colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.
In short, it is a vm provided for learning, running python code, machine learning or for general purpose.
## :moneybag:  Is it really free to use?
Yes, Colab is free to use. But there are some points which, according to me one should keep in mind:
1. Though colab is a free service, it shouldn't be exploited indiscriminately or without any care. One should value that its a resource offered for no cost and can get depleted/restricted if the demand increases out of control.
2. If it isn't obvious, one shouldn't run mission-critical services (like large and important servers/databases/python programs) on it. Its resources are not guaranteed and not unlimited, and the usage limits sometimes fluctuate. Also, the notebook has a maximum runtime of 12 hours, after which, it should be manually restarted.
3. If you need to use it pretty often for intensive tasks, consider purchasing a vps server. A heavy increase in server load would force google to close the service.

In the end, it is just my personal opinion and can be ignored safely. Just ask your heart whats right and whats wrong. Also, please try to use it as a once in a while resource and not 24x7 so that others can avail the free resources too.

## :page_with_curl: Instructions
1. Open the notebook in google colab.
3. Read through the notebook, most of the code is self explanatory. Run the cells which are useful for your use-case.
4. Run the first cell which runs the Minecraft server.
5. Now you have three options. You can either use ngrok, playit.gg or cloudflare's argo. Ngrok is easy to setup and doesn't requires anything to be installed by the clients but it can often be quite unreliable. Argo doesn't have such limitations but requires a bit more work. Playit.gg's implementation is unpolished at the moment (debug log spam) but offers convenient static subdomains.
  * Ngrok:
    Change `tunnel_service` variable and follow the prompts.
  * Cloudflare argo:
    1. After running the first cell,`Your free tunnel has started! Visit it <tunnel_address>` would be logged in the notebook console.
    2. Download [Cloudflared client](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/) on all the client machines.
    3. Now on your local machine, launch the binary with `./cloudflared-linux-amd64 access tcp --hostname <tunnel_address> --url 127.0.0.1:25565`
    4. Finally, connect to `127.0.0.1:25565` from your minecraft client.
  * Playit.gg:
    Change `tunnel_service` variable, ignore the debug output _(todo:fix)_ and follow the prompts.

## :zap:  So, how does it actually work?
As Google Colab is a VM running Ubuntu server as base OS, it can be easily used as a Minecraft server. Here are the steps which the notebook performs to setup the server:
1. Update the system's apt cache.
2. Install Openjdk-16 (Java) through apt-get.
3. Mount Google Drive to access the minecraft folder (Drive is used here to provide persistent storage).
4. Setup Argo/ngrok/playit Tunnel (Opening a tunnel at port 25565) depending on the `tunnel_service` variable.
5. Change directory to the minecraft-server folder on google drive (""Minecraft-server"" is the default, located in the root directory of my Google Drive.)
6. List/Print the file list on the screen to indicate succesful directory change.
7. Startup the Minecraft server (with optimized JVM parameters from [Aikar's guide)](https://aikar.co/2018/07/02/tuning-the-jvm-g1gc-garbage-collector-flags-for-minecraft/)

Herodotus is a deep-tweaked extreme Minecraft modpack that mixed magic and technology together. Based on Minecraft 1.12.2 with Forge, mainly made with CraftTweaker2, FTBQuests.

The name ""Herodotus"" came from a Greek historian. Herodotus recorded half-truths and half-falses in his book ""Histories"", just like the mix of magic and technology!

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ProjectHDS/Herodotus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for dev environment deploy guide.

|Build Status| |Docs Status| |Coverage Status|

SpockBot currently supports Minecraft 1.8.8

Minecraft bot framework written in Python, currently under heavy development.

- Protocol stuff lives in `spockbot/mcp <spockbot/mcp>`__
- Map stuff lives in `spockbot/mcmap <spockbot/mcmap>`__
- Data stuff lives in `spockbot/mcdata <spockbot/mcdata>`__
- Core client stuff lives in `spockbot/plugins/core <spockbot/plugins/core>`__
- Helpful client stuff lives in `spockbot/plugins/helpers <spockbot/plugins/helpers>`__

Client could loosely be called ""event-driven"". By default plugins
register handler functions to handle events that may or may not be
emitted by other plugins. Everything is a plugin in SpockBot, including
the event loop/framework itself, so you can feel free to rip out the
entire back end and replace it with your framework or paradigm of choice.
As long as you provide the same simple APIs, other plugins won't know the
difference.

We're only just getting started with documentation so if you're uncomfortable
reading source code this might not be the framework for you. Or, better yet,
hop on IRC and help us write some docs!

SpockBot officially supports Python 3.x and Python 2.7.x on \*nix operating
systems and requires cryptography_. It also runs on Windows and under
PyPy 2.6.x but that's not regularly tested and could be broken at any given
moment. If you support one of those use cases and SpockBot breaks for you,
submit an issue with a stack trace and we'll try to fix it.


Features
--------

- World Interaction (finding, placing, breaking)
- Vanilla Physics
- Pathfinding
- Inventory (player, chests, etc)
- Crafting
- Entity Tracking


Dependencies
------------

- Python 3.x or Python 2.7.x or PyPy 2.6.x

If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

Minecraft is a sandbox construction game, whose gameplay involves players interacting with the game world by placing and breaking various types of blocks in a three-dimensional environment. In this environment, players can build creative structures, creations, and artwork on multiplayer servers and singleplayer worlds across multiple game modes.

### Supported Servers
 
1. Minecraft (Vanilla)
2. Minecraft (Vanilla snapshot)
3. Spigot
4. Paper


**Shipped version:** 1.19.2~ynh2

## Disclaimers / important information

## Configuration

For server administration, use the Minecraft console or mcrcon (which is open on port 25575 and uses the password chosen during the install).

To use mcrcon, go to `/var/www/minecraft/mcrcon` and type:
```
./mcrcon -p YourPassword command
```
where `command` is a standard Minecraft command. You must use quotes if your command contains spaces.

You can find more info about the usage of mcrcon here: https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon

The **gamemode** and the **world seed** can be set in the config panel, in the webadmin.
Other settings can be set by modifying `/var/www/minecraft/server.properties`.

Team Game Manager. A Team Oriented Minecraft PVP plugin.

## Project Goals

1. **Advanced Game Engine with game logic implemented through modular programming.** 
Managers should offer hooks and data models to modules. 
Modules should be capable of communicating with one another.
The project should strive to make new game type development as straightforward as possible.

2. **Map.json Scripting Language.**
Maps need access to a baseline scripting service that allows for map-specific dynamic content.
As an example, a map should be able to provide different spawn points as the match time progresses.

3. This project is heavily influenced by [PGM](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/ProjectAres). Our goal with TGM is to shift more of the game logic to Java as opposed to map configuration files. This allows for the rapid development and modernization of gamemodes over time. 

Here's a basic example of what map configuration files look like:
```json
""spawns"": [
    {""teams"": [""spectators""], ""coords"": ""59, 48, 184.5, -180""},
    {""teams"": [""red""], ""coords"": ""149.5, 7, 184.5, 90""},
    {""teams"": [""blue""], ""coords"": ""-30.5, 7, 184.5, -90""}
],
""regions"": [
    {""id"": ""red-spawn-protection"", ""type"": ""cuboid"", ""min"": ""126, 0, 168"", ""max"": ""152, oo, 199""},
    {""id"": ""blue-spawn-protection"", ""type"": ""cuboid"", ""min"": ""-8, 0, 198"", ""max"": ""-34, oo, 167""},

    {""id"": ""build-height"", ""type"": ""cuboid"", ""min"": ""-oo, 40, -oo"", ""max"": ""oo, oo, oo""}
],
""filters"": [
    {
        ""type"": ""enter"", ""evaluate"": ""deny"", ""teams"": [""blue""],
        ""regions"": [""red-spawn-protection""], ""message"": ""&cYou may not enter this region.""
    },
    {
        ""type"": ""enter"", ""evaluate"": ""deny"", ""teams"": [""red""],
        ""regions"": [""blue-spawn-protection""], ""message"": ""&cYou may not enter this region.""
    },
    {
        ""type"": ""build"", ""evaluate"": ""deny"", ""teams"": [""red"", ""blue""],
        ""regions"": [""build-height""], ""message"": ""&cYou have reached the max build height.""
    }
]
```
  
  
## Local Server Setup
 
1. Start with the latest stable [Paper (PaperSpigot)](https://papermc.io/downloads) build. 

2. Compile the latest version of TGM or download it from our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.bennydoesstuff.me/job/TGM/).
 
3. Create a `Maps` folder in the root directory of your server and insert a supported TGM map. Make sure you also include a `rotation.json` file with the names of maps you would like to be present in the rotation.
    - You can download our Maps folder as a reference on the Maps repository located [here](https://github.com/WarzoneMC/Maps).
    - If you would like to load multiple map repositories or simply change the location, you can change the setting in the `plugins/TGM/config.yml` file.
 
4. Start the server. 
   - Additionally, if you would like stats to be saved, you need to set up the API [here](https://github.com/WarzoneMC/api) and enable the API feature in the `plugins/TGM/config.yml` file.

5. (Optional) Install WorldEdit for added telelport tool functionallity

## Compiling

1. Clone the repo to your computer.

2. Compile Spigot by downloading and running the BuildTools jar from [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools). Make sure you include the `--remapped` flag when compiling it, otherwise you might receive errors when later compiling the plugin.

3. Make sure you have Maven installed and run `mvn clean install` in the top-level folder to generate the required libraries. You can then download the jar from the `target` folder.

## Developer Tips

1. We use [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/). Make sure you have the Lombok plugin installed on your preferred IDE.

## Documentation

This plugin takes advantage of a ``map.json`` required by every map to configure the gamemode and to document the coordinates needed by the gamemode to function.  To learn more about the available gamemodes in the plugin, how to configure a map.json, and what features are currently offered through this file, we recommend checking out our Documentation repository located [here](https://github.com/Warzone/Docs). If you need any additional examples on how to format the JSON's, consider checking out our Maps repository as well located [here](https://github.com/Warzone/Maps).

**Paste, share & analyse your Minecraft logs**

## About
The project [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs) was created in 2017 by the Aternos team after more 
than 4 years of running free Minecraft servers and supporting users with 
their problems. One of the main issues was the impossibility to easily share 
the main source of errors: The Minecraft server log file. mclo.gs solves this 
problem and even goes one step further with providing syntax highlighting and 
suggestions based on the log content to simply solve common errors.

## Features
* Copy + paste log sharing
* Simple API for easy integration
* Syntax highlighting
* Line numbers
* Analysis and parsing using [codex](https://github.com/aternosorg/codex-minecraft)
* Different storage backends (mongodb, redis, filesystem)

## Development setup
* Install Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
* Install VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
* Clone repository: `git clone [URL]`
* `cd mclogs/vagrant`
* `vagrant up`
* Modify local `/etc/hosts` file: `10.7.7.18 mclogs.local api.mclogs.local`
* Open http://mclogs.local in browser and enjoy

If you wish to take over the project, I will gladly link your fork here. I would hate for this project to die. Simply drop me an email! I don't bite.
**I will not be answering any questions or provide any help regarding the setup of this web application**

I want the thank the minecraft community for providing a lot of support for the project. Especially to lolmewm for providing the original stats plugin which started the entire project and for his general support of the project.

However, due to a combination of leaving the minecraft community and others demanding support for a project that I developed for myself and graciously provided to the greater community under an open license, BlueStats will **not** be recieving any updates from myself.

# Blue-Stats-Minecraft
BlueStats is not your standard minecraft statistics panel. It is not made to support a single plugin, instead it is designed to support all of them. Through the use of plugins, BlueStats can be thought how to read the database layouts of bukkit/spigot plugins. Not only is it designed to display server statistics, it is designed to replace your server homepage to have a dynamically updating site with user statistics built right in!

BlueStats is expandable through the use of plugins and themes to suit your minecraft brand. While the included themes work out of the box, you are encouraged to create your own to advertise your server.

A live demo can be found here: https://stats.mysunland.org

Minecraft Tools for all Minecraft versions made in C#. It has almost 100 unique tools! Supports up to MC 1.16.4.

[UPDATE]
Due to some bugs that I can't solve right now, never download the source code directly, instead go to the releases page and from there ONLY download the zip files that have a date-time name format since they are the only ones updated at the moment.

[THE REST IS A VERY OLD README, NOW IT'S A LOT MORE ADVANCED, SOON I'LL UPDATE THIS README]

The new change log can be started by pressing Ctrl+L on the main window. And this repository includes a precompiled executable.

* EDIT: to save several hundreds of MB some of the bigger secret files were removed from the main application. So almost all features will still be fully working, but if you happen to want the missing secret files, then please download this big file from mediafire (please use some kind of pop-up blocker in your browser since mediafire is full of publicity), then extract it's contents in the same folder as the main executable in a way that the folder named ""Secrets"" inside the zip file ends up near your executable named ""Minecraft Tools.exe"", if done properly, when the secrets window is shown, then you should see that most of it's previously grayed buttons are now enabled, thisw means that all the files are now ready to work (please also add a folder named ""Secrets"" near the main executable if doesn't already exists and extract all the folders from the zip file inside it):

http://www.mediafire.com/file/m5zzza3yfdh1eij/Minecraft_Tools_Secrets_16_08_2019.zip

* EDIT: a file named ""A24938DB"" with 26.601 real Minecraft skins inside is missing from ""Minecraft-Tools-master\Minecraft Tools\bin\Debug\Secrets\Skins\"" because is over 25 MB (it's about 57 MB), so if you want to have it, now you can download it from here, but please add it manually to the path described above once you've downloaded the source code of this application and extracted it from it's zip file using the Secrets window (read the internal help for more info on how to show and enable the secret files by pressing F1):

Hello everyone my goal is to have an ""all-in-one"" free Minecraft tool, that could be used for anything Minecraft related. I have no intention to compete against others to see which one makes the best tool, but instead compete against myself to see how far I'll be able to develop it. I've never wanted any fame or money, I'm just looking for perfection in my creations, and to achieve this I knew I had to release it's source code to be able to help the Minecraft community as well, and since several people asked me to publish my app here, now you'll also be able to collaborate with your own ideas to improve it even more, so feel free to download it and play with it's code. Thanks a lot for your attention! :-)

Some of it's main features include (outdated, now it has a lot more unique and cool tools, so please try it out):

- Pixel art generator with the highest quality available
- NBT viewer and editor (editor not yet implemented)
- Auto-backup system when using ""write"" features like the NBT editor on the selected worlds and related files
- 2D world viewer with dozens of maps
- 3D structure generator based on painting simple 2D images also creates mazes and other cool structures
- Banner and shield designer with image exporter even with it's recipes
- Slime chunks finder based on text or numeric seeds
- World seed infinite calculator (literally!), I generated my own GetHash() based on as string, which supports infinite bits
- Painted structures exporter (WIP), like the 3D structure will use simple 2D images and will export a sequence in 2D
- Thumbnail generator and avergae color finder for any image, useful for new textures or resizing images
- Finder of differences between Minecraft .JAR versions, will find what files have changed after a new update to save time
- Redstone designer that will export to new Minecraft worlds, not yet implemented
- Real time Minecraft world clock, shows several hard to find info about the time and weather and it's also very fun
- Block info viewer, kind of a mini block wiki offline, currently unfinished
- Automatic skin downloader, if you find a server with skins, you might get thousands of them automatically without being kicked
- Note blocks tuner, in the future will record sound and tell you on which note (and maybe instrument?) it's tuned
- Villager tradings viewer, kind of a little help offline like a mini wiki
- Entities info viewer, like the villagers info about all the entities, like damage dealt on all difficulties
- Resource structure rebuilder, copies all the sounds, etc from Minecraft with their original names on your desktop
- Paintings viewer, contains the original Minecraft paintings and also all the info about them, even with effects and filters
- Enchantment names viewer, converts text to the Standard Galactic Alphabet and vice-versa also emulates the enchanting table
- Secrets, like all the Xbox 360 resource packs and skins for PC (converted by myself, and 100 % without errors), etc
- And a lot of other planned tools in the near future, so please stay tuned for more...

It also contains a bit of publicity in it's menu, with links to the free music albums made by myself (Júpiter Mauro Cámara),
and some friends of mine, David Maeso and Fratelli Stellari. Finally it also includes an internal wiki about the Hermitcraft server and it's members.

Anyone is more than welcome to collaborate in this project and make it more perfect and bigger. I'm opened to listen any suggestion, although some things are difficult to make, so maybe you're the one that can help to improve it or add new features to it.

Also feel free to use any part of it's code in your own project, but please remember to give credit to me as the original author.

Note: the application shows English it's language, but internally is programmed in Spanish, which is where I'm from.

Thanks a lot for all your help and have a great day! ;-)

In order to build ATLauncher, you will need any Java version 8 or above. Java 8 is recommended since we compile to Java
8 compatability regardless.

Everything else that's needed for the project is provided by Gradle, and accessed using the Gradle wrapper which can be
invoked by using `./gradlew`.

## Building

To build this project, simply run:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

This will build the application and output the resulting files for Windows, Linux and OSX in the `dist` directory.

## Running in test

If you want to run the launcher while developing with it, you can use your IDE (if you have one) to do that for you.

Alternatively you can run:

```sh
./gradlew run --args=""--debug --working-dir=testLauncher""
```

Setting the `--working-dir=testLauncher` argument is necessary as it will ensure that the launchers files are not
spewed in the root directory and are instead contained within a gitignored folder.

## Using an IDE

This project is mainly setup and developed to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development. You're free
to use any other IDE that you're accustomed to (if any), but by using VSCode, you get the benefit of predefined tasks
and launch commands as well as a list of extensions recommended for the project.

We also provide some base project files for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) so that if you use that,
you should get access to our base project files which contain correct launch tasks for testing the application as well
as tasks for running the UI/Unit tests.

## Checking for dependency updates

To check for dependency updates with gradle, simply run:

```sh
./gradlew dependencyUpdates
```

This will print a report to the console about any dependencies which have updates.

## Updating license headers in all files

If you add new files, or update the `LICENSEHEADER` file, you can add that to all source files by running:

```sh
./gradlew updateLicenses
```

To check that they're all correct, you can run the below command:

```sh
./gradlew checkLicenses
```

This is run during the CI process, and will fail if the license is missing or not up to date, so make sure that you add
this to all new files you create.

## Create Custom Themes

ATLauncher supports custom themes. The process is fairly straight forward, but may require a lot of trial and error.

First you must create a `MyThemeName.java` in the `src/main/java/com/atlauncher/themes/` directory. Your theme should
extend one of the base ATLauncher themes depending on what you need:

-   `Dark` is the default theme and is a dark theme. It's a good place to start with some defaults for new dark themes.
-   `Light` is a light theme. It's a good place to start with some defaults for new light themes.
-   `ATLauncherLaf` is a base class which every theme MUST at some point extend. It provides some defaults including our
    brand colours and some defaults. This shouldn't be extended from unless you need absolute power.

Once you've created your class (look at other themes in the directory for an idea on what you can do), you'll need to
create a properties file in the `src/main/resources/com/atlauncher/themes/` directory. This properties file is how you
setup and change UI elements. You should use the existing examples in that directory as examples.

Last step is to register the theme in the file `src/main/java/com/atlauncher/gui/tabs/settings/GeneralSettingsTab.java`.

Now you can open the launcher and then switch to your theme.

We use a library called [FlatLaf](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf) to provide theme support. There are some
good references listed below to see the default values for the themes and see what you can overwrite:

-   <https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf/blob/master/flatlaf-core/src/main/resources/com/formdev/flatlaf/FlatLaf.properties>
    -   This file contains all the base properties for all themes
-   <https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf/blob/master/flatlaf-core/src/main/resources/com/formdev/flatlaf/FlatLightLaf.properties>
    -   This file contains all the base properties for light themes
-   <https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf/blob/master/flatlaf-core/src/main/resources/com/formdev/flatlaf/FlatDarkLaf.properties>
    -   This file contains all the base properties for dark themes

### IntelliJ theme.json Support

You can also take IntelliJ `theme.json` files and convert them to themes for ATLauncher. From within the `theme.json`
file, take the `UI` object and plug that into [this site](https://tools.fromdev.com/json-to-property-converter.html) to
convert it from JSON to properties format.

There are also special rules you need to apply as we currently do not support these `theme.json` files out of the box,
so you need to manually apply the [transformations](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf/blob/master/flatlaf-core/src/main/java/com/formdev/flatlaf/IntelliJTheme.java)
in order for the theme to work exactly right.

For an example, see the `DraculaContrast` theme which uses this method.

### Tools To Help Theme Development

To help with theme development, with the launcher running (not in the release version, only in development), you can
press `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + X` to bring up a tool to highlight UI components to see their properties. You can also press
`Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Y` to bring up a list of all the default properties in the UIManager. These values can be modified
in your `.properties` file.

## Plugging In Your Data

To get started with the code and plug in your own data, you need to edit the
`/src/main/java/com/atlauncher/constants/Constants.java` file.

By using this source code you don't get permissions to use our CDN/files/assets/modpacks. See the License section at the
bottom for more.

Most of of them should be self explanatory, if not please stop by our [Discord](https://atl.pw/discord) and ask in the
`#development` channel if you need help understanding any of the values.

A couple values in the constants file are specific for ATLauncher and shouldn't be used in any forks. These are the
CurseForge Core api key and the Microsoft Login Client ID.

You can apply for a CurseForge Core key through
[this link](https://forms.monday.com/forms/dce5ccb7afda9a1c21dab1a1aa1d84eb) and a Microsoft Login Client ID through
[this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

## Versioning System

Starting with version 3.2.1.0 a new versioning system was put into place. It works off the following:

Reserved.Major.Minor.Revision.Stream

So for 3.2.1.0 the major number is 2 and minor number is 1 and revision number is 0. Reserved is used as a base, only
incremented on complete rewrites. The stream is optional.

Major should be incremented when large changes/features are made.

Minor should be incremented when small changes/features are made.

Revision should be incremented when there are no new features and only contains bug fixes for the previous minor.

Build is used for beta releases allowing you to have higher version numbers but force users to update when the real
release comes.

Stream is used to define if it's a ""Release"" or a ""Beta"". When not provided, it defaults to ""Release"".

### Updating The Version

The version can be updated in a single place in the `/src/main/resources/version` file.

The stream value doesn't need to be provided, but should only ever be ""Beta"". When a release is ready to go out, the
stream should be removed from the version so that everything will automatically release.

## Translating

ATLauncher is written for English speakers. All our translations are community run by those who take their time and
submit updates to the text in a different language.

If you wish to help translate ATLauncher, please visit our page on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/atlauncher) and
start translating.

### Updating the template file

Every push to master will automatically add any new strings that need translating via GitHub actions.

#### Manual Steps

If new strings are added to the launcher, the template file will need to be updated in order to take into account the
new strings.

In order to do this, run `./gradlew generatePots` which will scan the source files and create a
`build/gettext/translations.pot` file.

Note that out of the box, this will not generate in the correct format. You must run the `deduplicateTranslations` script in
the `scripts/deduplicateTranslations` folder which will use Docker to fix the `translations.pot` file.

This file can then be uploaded to Crowdin by ATLauncher staff to give access to the translators.

### Adding new languages from Crowdin

Running [this action](https://github.com/ATLauncher/ATLauncher/actions/workflows/download-translations.yml) will
download all approved translations strings and make a commit to master with then changed language files.

#### Manual Steps

Once a language has been translated enough to add support to the launcher (or update support) there's a few steps we
need to take.

First grab the built project from Crowdin, and then grab out the translation to add/update. For this example, let's take
German.

Pop this file in the `scripts/processTranslations/in` directory and then run the `scripts/processTranslations.bat` or
`scripts/processTranslations.sh` file to fix them up and output them into the `scripts/processTranslations/out`
directory.

Now take the converted files from the `scripts/processTranslations/out` directory and put them in the
`src\main\resources\assets\lang` directory.

Now open `src\main\java\com\atlauncher\data\Language.java` and in the static block at the top, add in the language:

```java
// add in the languages we have support for
static {
    locales.add(Locale.ENGLISH);
    locales.add(new Locale(""de"", ""DE""));
}
```

Now the launcher should have the option to change to the language/s.

A simple way to keep in terms of the license is by forking this repository and leaving it open source under the same

saddening. So please take a look at the license and respect what we're doing.

Also, while we cannot enforce this under the license, you cannot use our CDN/files/assets/modpacks on your own launcher.
Again we cannot enforce this under the license, but needless to say, we'd be very unhappy if you did that and really
would like to leave cease and desist letters as a last resort.

# What is this?
This is a minecraft maper viewer written entirely in HTML5, Javascript and WebGL.
# What does it do?
You can load region files from your minecraft save files and it'll load them and show you a 3 dimensional view of your map, as if you were flying through the map in game
# What it does not do?
It's not minecraft for the web browser.
# Other Info
* Only loads region files in the Anvil format (Minecraft 1.2).
* Some textures are not implemented, such as sand, sandstone, brick, etc.
* Texture IDs are not implemented.
* It's very slow (no web workers used, but may consider using them in the future).
* Some chunks may not be rendered on first load. Just move around and they should appear.

675,Wurst-Imperium/ForgeWurst,Java,"# ForgeWurst

Wurst Client for Minecraft Forge.

This repository only contains the source code and is not intended for end users. Go to https://forge.wurstclient.net/ for ready-to-use downloads and installation instructions.

## How To Use This Code In Eclipse

1. Clone this repository.

2. Go into the `ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2` folder and run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace.bat`, followed by `gradlew eclipse.bat`.

3. Repeat step 2 for all of the remaining versions (currently just 1.12.2). Please always use the .bat files, as some versions will not work if you run the Gradle commands directly.

3. In Eclipse, go to `Import... > Existing Projects into Workspace`. Select the folder where you saved this repository as the root directory.

4. Select all of the projects that Eclipse has found (currently just two), then click <kbd>Finish</kbd>. At this point `ForgeWurst MC 1.12.2` is already working, but `ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2` still shows some errors. That's because we have a shared source folder in the 1.12.2 project that the other versions (currently just 1.10.2) also need access to.

5. Right-click on the `ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2` project and select `New > Folder`. Click on <kbd>Advanced >></kbd> and select `Link to alternate location (Linked Folder)`.

6. Click on <kbd>Browse...</kbd> and navigate to `ForgeWurst\ForgeWurst MC 1.12.2\src\shared\java`. Change the ""Folder name:"" section from ""java"" to ""shared-src"", then click <kbd>Finish</kbd>.

7. The `shared-src` folder should now show up in Eclipse, under the `ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2` project. Right-click on this folder and select `Build Path > Use as Source Folder`.

8. Both projects should now be working without any errors. In the future, you will need to repeat steps 5-7 for all projects except the one that hosts the shared source folder.

## How To Compile The Project Into Runnable .JAR Files

After you have set up the code in Eclipse by following the above steps, the `gradlew build` script will only work for ForgeWurst MC 1.12.2. To make it work with the other versions (currently just 1.10.2), you will first need to create a directory junction from `ForgeWurst\ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2\src\shared` to `ForgeWurst\ForgeWurst MC 1.12.2\src\shared`.

1. Navigate to `ForgeWurst\ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2\src` and open the console. If you are using PowerShell, type `cmd` before continuing with step 2.

2. Run the following command: `mklink /J shared ""../../ForgeWurst MC 1.12.2/src/shared""`.

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-join%20chat-brightgreen.svg)](https://gitter.im/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol)

Adds FML/Forge support to [node-minecraft-protocol](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol) (requires 0.17+)

## Features

* Supports the `FML|HS` client handshake
* Adds automatic Forge mod detection to node-minecraft-protocol's auto-versioning

## Usage

Installable as a plugin for use with node-minecraft-protocol:

```javascript
var mc = require('minecraft-protocol');
var forgeHandshake = require('minecraft-protocol-forge').forgeHandshake;
var client = mc.createClient({
    host: host,
    port: port,
    username: username,
    password: password
});

forgeHandshake(client, {forgeMods: [
  { modid: 'mcp', version: '9.18' },
  { modid: 'FML', version: '8.0.99.99' },
  { modid: 'Forge', version: '11.15.0.1715' },
  { modid: 'IronChest', version: '6.0.121.768' }
]});
```

The `forgeMods` option is an array of modification identifiers and versions to present
to the server. Servers will kick the client if they do not have the required mods.

To automatically present the list of mods offered by the server, the `autoVersionForge`
plugin for node-minecraft-protocol's `autoVersion` (activated by `version: false`) can
be used:

```javascript
var mc = require('minecraft-protocol');
var autoVersionForge = require('minecraft-protocol-forge').autoVersionForge;
var client = mc.createClient({
    version: false,

autoVersionForge(client);
```

This will automatically install the `forgeHandshake` plugin, with the appropriate mods,
if the server advertises itself as Forge/FML. Useful for connecting to servers you don't
know if they are Forge or not, or what mods they are using.

## Example

    npm start

## Installation

`npm install minecraft-protocol-forge`

## Debugging

You can enable some protocol debugging output using `NODE_DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
NODE_DEBUG=""minecraft-protocol-forge"" node [...]
```

This is a Minecraft Bedrock addon port of the famous WorldEdit mod for Minecraft: Java Edition. The addon comes with custom commands to make building easier, and more fun! Not only are there commands, but also items to make it easier for anyone on any device to use this.
__Please note that this addon requires experimental features. To be on the safe side, make a backup of your world.__

## Installation
### Locally
First you must download the mcaddon file. You can find one in the [release section](https://github.com/SIsilicon/WorldEdit-BE/releases). After which, you open it with Minecraft and it will be imported into your game. Once there, choose a world you want to apply this addon to, and add the behaviour pack (the resource pack should apply automatically). The ""Holiday Creator Features"" and ""GameTest Framework"" experimental features must also be enabled.
![GameTest Framework and Holiday Creator Features](docs/Experimental_Features.jpg)
And that's it! Your world is ready for WorldEdit.

### Aternos server
To properly add this addon to the server, you first need to upload an already existing world with the required experimental features enabled (Do NOT add the addon to the world directly). You must then install the addon separately in the server's `packs` folder. Read more about how aternos handles addons and experimental features [here](https://support.aternos.org/hc/en-us/articles/360042095232-Installing-Addons-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-) and [here](https://support.aternos.org/hc/en-us/articles/4407553257873-Enabling-experimental-gameplay-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-).

## Features
WorldEdit currently has the following features.
- Clipboard manipulation (Cut, Copy, Paste)
- Masking blocks from certain actions
- Maniuplating region selections
- Navigation commands and the Navigation Wand
- Generating shapes
- Multiblock patterns
- Undo and Redo
- Brushes for painting/affecting blocks
- Manipulating biomes
- Exporting and imports structures

## Planned
These features will be added in the near future.
- More brushes and tools
- More selection shapes
- More selection operations
- Palletes
- Basically, Java Parity

## Documentation
The addon comes with a quick start on how to use WorldEdit in `Settings > How to Play` while you're in the world.
There's a more in-depth documentation over at the project's docs page: https://worldedit-be-docs.readthedocs.io

681,microsoft/minecraft-gametests,JavaScript,"# Project

This repo contains sample GameTest behavior files for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Minecraft supports GameTests - a combination of JavaScript + MCStructures - for validating facets of Minecraft behavior. You can use GameTests to validate facets of your creations, as well!

## Getting started with GameTest

To get started with GameTest Framework in Minecraft, see this [GameTest Framework Introduction](https://aka.ms/gametest) page.

A tutorial for creating your first GameTest is available [here](https://aka.ms/newgametest). The sample code for the tutorial is within this repo, at [/behavior_packs/StarterTestsTutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-gametests/tree/main/behavior_packs/StarterTestsTutorial).

## Behavior packs & tests

#### NOTE: The main branch is compatible with the latest released main version of Minecraft. The beta branch is generally compatible with the latest updated beta version of Minecraft.

## Using these behavior packs

To use these behavior packs with an installed Windows 10 version of Minecraft Bedrock Edition:

1. Copy the desired behavior packs into the `development_behavior_packs` (`%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_behavior_packs`) folder
2. Create a new world in Minecraft with the following options:

- Enable the GameTest Framework Experiment
- Set to Creative mode
- Add the desired Behavior packs

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. For the GameTests you'd like to submit for inclusion in this sample repo, please make sure:

- the GameTest(s) are small and self contained
- can run in a short amount of time, with clear pass/fail criteria
- are generally passing, or used to document an unexpected failure and are tagged as such (with the .tag function on .register)
- do not have any external dependencies (e.g., on extra behavior or resource packs)
- for JavaScript, that files are formatted consistent with the settings defined in prettierrc.json (mainly, two-space indentation)

### Contributing:
For those interested in contributing simply pull down the master branch, add your changes and make a PR! I'm not overly
stringent on formatting, just try and keep the same style that you see in the code, or when in doubt just ask!

This is a
gradle based project, so to make your life easier I recommend importing the project as such in your IDE. To build the
plugin, simple run `gradlew build` on the root folder and then the plugin jar should be found in `Core/build/libs` when
the build completes.

All core code that you will ikely need to edit will be located inside the `Core` module, but version compatibility code
can be found in the NMS Support folder and then the corresponding version module."
684,Arcensoth/mcdata,Shell,"# mcdata
Version-controlled history of Minecraft's generated data.

Since [Minecraft snapshot 18w01a](https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-18w01a) Mojang has exposed the game's internal data generators, allowing us to get a data-driven dump of commands, blocks, items, and all sorts of nice things.

This repository uses [mcgen](https://github.com/Arcensoth/mcgen) to invoke the server generators and process the output.

You can produce the raw data yourself by running the following command, replacing `{jar_path}` with the actual path to the server jar:

```bash
# Prior to 21w39a:
java -cp {jar_path} net.minecraft.data.Main --server --reports

# From 21w39a onward:
java -DbundlerMainClass=net.minecraft.data.Main -jar {jar_path} --server --reports
```

Server downloads can be found via Mojang's [version manifest](https://piston-meta.mojang.com/mc/game/version_manifest_v2.json).

## Disclaimer
*This repository is working under the assumption that, because they intentionally exposed their internal data generators, Mojang does not have anything against the resulting data existing somewhere on the internet for public consumption. If ever this assumption is contradicted, the repository will be promptly removed.*

An actual better grass and snow mod for Fabric.

## 📖 What's this mod?

Have you ever used the MCPatcher/OptiFine better grass feature?
I did, and I didn't like it at all.
The main issue is that it's too rough even at Fancy settings.
That's why I made my own mod to fix this issue and provide an alternative to one of the OptiFine features on the Fabric ecosystem!
Grass blocks will now connect, and the nearby grass blocks will be smoothed.

## ✅ Features:

- Connect grass blocks
- Connect mycelium blocks
- Connect podzol blocks
- Connect grass path blocks
- Connect crimson nylium blocks
- Connect warped nylium blocks
- Add snow layer to many non-full blocks when Better Snow is enabled
- Add moss layer to many non-full blocks when Better Snow is enabled
- Add an optional built-in resource pack to have snowy fences.
- API for resource pack creators and modders to add new block connection following the better grass rule or new alternate models for blocks following the better snow rule.
- And more!

## 📖 Usage

Using this mod is very simple!

Install it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu].

You will notice that some blocks like grass blocks will connect together, if you want to try other options or want to have the same look as OptiFine you can look into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu].

<!-- modrinth_exclude.start -->
### Build

Just do `./gradlew shadowRemapJar` and everything should build just fine!
<!-- modrinth_exclude.end -->

### For resource packs creators and developers

This is a Spigot Plugin, which lets you watch videos in vanilla Minecraft. This is done using Item Frames and some quick Maths. (actually the maths is kinda not quick). **Note, that this is not usable for real life application, but rather as a proof of concept.** It is also important to note, that this should not encourage anyone to watch or distribute pirated movies using Minecraft. 

## How it works

The process to display videos in the Client is kinda tedious, so read carefully. 

1. First of all we know, that Minecraft works with 20 ticks/s, so I figured I will stick to one frame per tick, meaning to a total of 20 fps. 
2. To read videos, I used ffmpeg at the beginning (well a library for it), but since this library is >200MB I ended up using Images only for dev. => this meant using ffmpeg (in the console) to split the video into its frames. (here it is important, that we make sure that the video only has 20fps)
3. Then we read those images one by one and ""render"" them. And with render I mean we first split the images into 128*128 chunks (for the Item Frames), after which we need to match the RGBA colors of the PNG to Minecraft Map Colors (MMC). The latter process of which takes a lot of processing power, which makes real time rendering not possible. Finally we also need to calculate the relative Positions of those Item Frames, so that the Video Frames are displayed correctly.
4. Last but not least we need to save the file, so that we can load it at a later point.
5. Displaying those rendered frames is done using Packets -> [Protocol](https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Map_Data) 
6. To now update them, we go through each Location, send a packet to destroy the frame that is currently there and then send a Packet for the new frame to show. (simplified). 
7. To provide Audio I created a little Discord Bot, which uses JDA (Java Discord API). 



## Performance

This is a really interesting section, since we have a few problems regarding it:

1. Rendering
2. Files
3. Networking



### Rendering

Rendering a video is really hard work for the computer. As much as I would have liked real time rendering (and displaying), it just does not work, because the function, which matches RGBA to MMC is on the lower end of the spectrum when talking about performance. I tried using a different algorithm (which also would not have made real time rendering possible), but this resulted in wrong colors, because there is a certain red shift we would need to calculate for the MMC. 

### Files

Because Real Time Rendering is not possible, I decided to save the files, since rendering is (as I mentioned several times) really hard work. This does not sound that bad, until you realize, the MMC types have a size of 1B. Now you have that for each Pixel. Meaning that if you have a video of 1920x1080, you would get >2Million Pixels => >2MB per Video Frame! If you now have a 1 minute Video with 20FPS and 1080p you would end up with almost 2,5GB. And then you also have 2B for the relative position. This relative position is only for each Item Frame though, so for a 1080p video you would end up with 120 Item Frames, each of those containing 128 Pixels.

### Networking

All those things above could be condoned, but THIS crushes everything. We know that each Item Frame contains 128x128 Pixels, and that each of those Pixels has a MMC, which has a size of 1B. This means, that each Item Frame has a size of over 16KB!! Since we have 120 Item Frames per Video Frame, we need to transmit ~2MB of Pixel Data. Since we want a Video and not a static image, we now need to do that 20 times a second, leading us to 40MB/s!!!! And this is only per Player. Meaning you would need a server with a good internet connection and then you need users, who all have at least 40MB/s of Download Speed. 

### Conclusion

The Networking part really crushed this whole Project, but it is still possible on localhost. It is probably also possible in your local Network. Also important to mention is, that because of all those Packets, you will time out after some time. The Server handles it with no problems, but the Client somehow cannot send any Packets to the Server anymore. 



## Usage

To use the Plugin you first of all either need to download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/0Adiber/MinecraftMovies/releases) or you clone the Repo and [build](https://github.com/0Adiber/MinecraftMovies#build) it yourself. You will also need a Spigot-1.16.2 Server

### Setup

Put the plugin in your plugins folder, reload the Server and then open  `plugins/MinecraftMovies/config.yml`. In this file you need to specify your Discord Bot Token (which you have to create of course). You will also need to make sure, that your Bot is on the Server (at least needs permissions to Join and Speak)

### Create a Canvas

Use `/cc` to create a Canvas and remember the `CID`!

![Create Canvas](/images/cc.png)

### Render Video

To render a video there are a few more steps needed.

1. Download FFMPEG 
2. Go to `<your server>/plugins/MinecraftMovies/movies/`, create a new folder `FOLDER` and paste in your video file `FILE`.
3. Use FFMPEG to get the video to 20FPS `ffmpeg -i FILE -filter:v fps=fps=20 out.mp4`
4. Then split the `FILE` intro separate images using `ffmpeg -i out.mp4 -qscale:v 1 %d.png`
5. Now get the audio of your video: `ffmpeg -i out.mp4 FOLDER.mp3` (it is important, that the name of the MP3 is `FOLDER`)
6. Cut and Paste the `FOLDER.mp3` into `plugins/MinecraftMovies/saves/audio` (create folder if not exists)
7. Now we can actually render the Video in MC by typing `/render CID folder FOLDER` => the progress can be seen in the Server Console

![Render](/images/rendr.png)

Note that this process will take some time depending on the length of the video and make sure you have enough RAM allocated to the server. 

### Verify

After the Render has finished you will get a notification in the console and in your Client. Before we can play a video, we need to do one last thing, which is verifying with Discord. This is done in two steps:

1. Use the `/verify` command in Minecraft to get a code `CODE`

   ![VerifyCmd](/images/verify.png)

2. Go to Discord, open the direct message for the Bot and type `m!verify CODE`

3. Now your MC UUID is linked with your Discord User ID (at the moment this is not being saved though, so you need to do that every time you restart the server)

### Playing

Finally we can play the Video. Before you do that, make sure you are in a Discord Channel on which the Bot is (if you don't, the video won't start). Now we simply execute `/start CID FOLDER`. And we hear the Bot joining the Channel and a Wall of Frames displaying in Minecraft. 

![video](/images/vid.png)

And there you have the Marvel Intro from [Captain America: The Winter Soldier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIBg2oUYcAQ). And it looks surprisingly good. (And the audio in discord is also clean)

## Build

Building the Plugin requires Maven. And the Spigot API as well as the Spigot Server file. 

### Aquire Spigot files

1. Download Spigot Build Tools [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/BuildTools.jar)
2. Execute `java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.16.2` => this will build Spigot (and other versions) and copy them into your local Maven repository. 

### Create .jar

All you need to do now is package the source code using maven. (I did this using IntelliJ). The command would be `mvn package` (if you have maven actually installed)

A fork of [mcpe_viz](https://github.com/Plethora777/mcpe_viz.git).

Bedrock Viz is a tool that parses Minecraft Bedrock Edition world files.  It creates overview images from the world files, and reports *lots* of details on your world.

It can also create a powerful Google Maps-like Web App for viewing your world.

Additional Features:

* Create a powerful Google Maps-like web app viewer for your world.
  * Browse through all 256 layers of your world (Overworld and Nether) from bedrock to build limit.
  * Examine the location and details of mobs and items in your world.
  * Visualize chunk boundaries -- consider it an extremely cumbersome F3/debug mode!
  * Find slime chunks -- well, probably... slime chunk finding code is currently a bit weird in MCPE, it appears to work, but please be sure to confirm slimes are spawning in a chunk before you do a ton of work :)
  * Explore the biomes of your world.
  * Shaded-relief elevation overlay -- get a sense of the topography of your world.
  * Measure distances in your world

* Create many types of images:
  * All layers of your world
  * Biomes in your world (very interesting!)
  * Block height in your world (kind of like a topographic map)

* Create movies of all layers from bedrock to build limit (*ffmpeg* required)

## Quick Start

For Windows users:

* [Download the zip file](https://github.com/bedrock-viz/bedrock-viz/releases/download/v0.1.8/bedrock-viz_v0.1.8_win_x64.zip) and unzip that file
* Inside you will find `bedrock-viz.exe`
* Run `bedrock-viz.exe` in your favorite terminal program (such as `Command Prompt` or `Power Shell`)

For macOS users(requires macOS 10.15 and above):
* Install via homeberw:
  ```
  brew tap bedrock-viz/homebrew-tap && brew install bedrock-viz
  ```

For Linux users:
* [Download the source](https://github.com/bedrock-viz/bedrock-viz/releases/download/v0.1.7/bedrock-viz_v0.1.8_linux.tar.gz) and compiling from source

**DO NOT RUN THIS ON YOUR ORIGINAL WORLD SAVES**

**MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR DATA AND RUN THIS AGAINST THAT COPY ONLY**

Use the app to select the MCPE world file, the output directory, output name, and mode.  Press ""Go!"".  Watch the progress of bedrock-viz.  If it completes successfully, you can click the ""Launch Web App"" button.  If there was a problem, you should look in the ""Progress"" window for details that might help you resolve the issue.

See below for Web App usage notes.


## Quick Start -- How to run it on Windows from the command-line

* Same as above to get the files.
* Open a command prompt and run it something like this:

```
bedrock-viz.exe --db path-to-your-world-file-dir/ --out out1 --html-most
```

Note: Replace ""path-to-your-world-file-dir/"" with the actual directory which contains your world files -- it wants the directory that has level.dat in it.

**DO NOT RUN THIS ON YOUR ORIGINAL MCPE DATA FILES; MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR DATA AND RUN THIS AGAINST THAT COPY ONLY!**

This will produce a bunch of image files and ""index.html"" in the directory `out1`. Open ""index.html"" in your browser.


## Web App

You can create a browser-based viewer for your world files.  It will allow you to pan, zoom and switch between the different images.  It's pretty spiffy!

To make a quick viewer (with all regular images, but without indvidual layers), do something like this:

```
> ./bedrock-viz --db ./mcpe/another1/ --out ./mcpe/output/out1 --html-most
```

To make a complete viewer (with all images and all layers), do something like this:

```
> ./bedrock-viz --db ./mcpe/another1/ --out ./mcpe/output/out1 --html-all
```

This will create a LOT of images -- individual images for each layer of the overworld and nether, as well as all the regular images.  It will also create ""./mcpe/output/out1.html"".  Load this file in your browser and you will have an Openlayers-based viewer for your world!  Openlayers (http://openlayers.org/) is a powerful javascript library for mapping.

Web App Usage Notes:
* Zoom in with double click or press the ""+"" button (upper left)
* Zoom out with shift-double click or press the ""-"" button (upper left)
* Move with click and drag
* Rotate with shift-alt click and drag
* Your mouse position is shown in the upper right in world coordinates and image coordinates
* You can go full-screen (button under mouse position window)
* Tool bar at the bottom of the screen:
  * Choose Overworld or Nether
  * Scroll through the layers from 0 (bedrock) to 255 (build limit)
  * Choose Overview, Biome etc
  * Show Mobs and Objects -- click on an entry and the map will be updated with labeled points.  You can toggle on as many different types as you like.  Click on the points or labels to get more info on the item.  Note that labels are not drawn when you are zoomed out.
  * Enable elevation overlay (shaded relief)
  * Enable chunk grid overlay


## Web App Notes

If you are loading the web app from a local file -- that is, not accessing it from a web server -- your browser may impose restrictions on image loading and access to image pixels which makes it very difficult for the web app to deliver the best experience.  Currently, Firefox appears to be the browser most willing to play nicely.  The web app will let you know if you are impacted by this issue.  For example, on Chrome, you will not see block information on mouse over, or be able to see the elevation overlay -- both of which are totally cool :)

If you are running Firefox or serving the files from a web server, you can make the web app load a little bit faster by adding the option ""--no-force-geojson"" to your command line.  This prevents bedrock-viz from using a workaround for the above issue.

## Using an NGINX Webserver in Docker to display your world
If you want to display your map locally through a webserver in Docker, these commands will set up an NGINX webserver with your data copied into a volume mounted to the /usr/share/nginx/html directory. The webserver is exposed on port 8080 and the web app can be viewed at http://localhost:8080.

**Be aware of what folder will be copied to avoid copying sensitive files/folders. It is recommended to always ouput to a new directory.**
```
docker volume create bedrock-viz-http
docker create --name bedrock-viz -p 8080:80 -v bedrock-viz-http:/usr/share/nginx/html -d nginx
# This cmd will copy the entire /path/to/output/folder recursively. Be careful!
docker cp /path/to/output/folder:/usr/share/nginx/html bedrock-viz
docker run bedrock-viz
```
To clean up your webserver and data when you are done:
```
docker rm bedrock-viz
docker volume rm bedrock-viz-http
```

## Usage

**MAKE A COPY OF YOUR DATA AND RUN THIS AGAINST THAT COPY ONLY!**

Here's an example invocation:

```
> ./bedrock-viz --grid --db ./mcpe/another1/ --out ./mcpe/output/out1
```

This will read the leveldb from the ""./mcpe/another1"" folder and name output files starting with ""./mcpe/output/out1"", and it will draw chunk boundaries on your output image.  This also dumps the *voluminous* output to ""out1.log"".  The log file has a *ton* of interesting information about your world.  ""grep"" is your friend.

Please note that --db expects the directory which contains ""level.dat"".

To view all command line options, run
```
""./bedrock-viz --help""
```

For extended usage instructions, see [USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md)

## How to backup your MCPE world files

On Android, [see this link](http://pocketbeta.minecraft.net/p/how-to-make-backup.html).

On iOS or Windows 10, [see this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/MCPE/comments/3h28ku/how_to_backuptransfer_worlds/)

Note that MCPE is sometimes weird about actually closing world files -- that is, you think that MCPE is closed and should be done with the world file, but a backup of it may not work correctly.  To be certain that you get a good backup, you should reboot and then do the backup *before* starting MCPE again.

### Automated backup to Dropbox using DropSync (Android)

On Android, you can use [DropSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync) to automatically backup your MCPE world to your dropbox account.  You configure this tool to backup any of your world files to dropbox.  As you play on your device, DropSync will copy the updated world files to Dropbox.  Very cool!  Install Dropbox's client (there's even one for [Linux](https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx)) on the machine you use for MCPE Viz.  It is recommended to copy the data from your local Dropbox folder to another folder to prevent Dropbox from syncing *from* your MCPE Viz machine.  Running MCPE Viz on the world files *does* change the world files.  This method has only been *lightly* tested, so be careful.

## Error messages

This program uses a lot of file handles and depending on your OS's defaults (OS X's are too low) you can have a failure that resembles the following:
```
  Generate full-size slices
    Writing all images in one pass
  ERROR: Failed to open output file (../worlds/output/images/kYQJAGOeAQA=.mcpe_viz_slice.full.overworld.247.png) errno=Too many open files(24)
  libpng error: No IDATs written into file
  ERROR: PngWriter setjmp triggered -- image might be too large (2672 x 1600)
  zsh: segmentation fault  ../bedrock-viz/build/bedrock-viz --db ../worlds/kYQJAGOeAQA= --out  --html-all
```

You can check your limits and temporarily set file descriptors with the following:
```
ulimit -a
ulimit -n 8192
```

A package to allow you to run a Minecraft server on your Synology NAS

History

I wanted to set up a private Minecraft server for my son.  I found work by patters at:

http://pcloadletter.co.uk/2012/01/11/minecraft-package-for-synology/

Unfortunately it hadn't been updated in about 2 years, but from the comments it was apparent that people were still
using it and manually updating the files.  Well, BLECH!  I decided to try to clean it up because, well, I'm a glutton
for punishment.

Craftbukkit was effectively killed off and replaced by Spigot, so I added it to the package, and I recently added Paper, a highly efficient Spigot fork, to the package.  Paper is probably the best Java minecraft server to run right now if you're running a low resource server like a NAS.

You can find more information on my blog at:

http://blog.heatdfw.com/p/synology-minecraft-server-setup.html

You can install the package from my repository at:
http://www.hildinger.us/sspks/index.php

I've started discussion threads at:

https://community.synology.com/enu/forum/10/post/131756
http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/server-support/server-administration/2460654-synology-nas-minecraft-server-install-package

Compatitibility, Java, etc.

Honestly, any Synology machine that has the power should be OK, and I'm not able to tell you if yours is one of them -- they have a bunch of machines with a wide range of power.
As of now, I'm using a RS814+ with DSM 5.2 (previously 5.1) and the Java VM published by Synology.  patters also has Java packages at:

http://packages.pcloadletter.co.uk/

I won't pretend to know what's right for you.

691,phonon/blender-minecraft-json,Python,"Blender Minecraft JSON Import/Export
=======================================
Import/export cuboid geometry between Blender and Minecraft .json model format. The Blender model must follow very specific restrictions for the exporter to work (read **Export Guide** below).

Supports import/export uvs. This addon can export solid material colors packed into an auto-generated image texture (alongside normal textures), so you can mix textures and solid face colors on Blender meshes.

Tested on Blender 2.83, 2.92.


Installation
---------------------------------------
1. `git clone` or copy this repository into your `scripts/addons` or custom scripts folder.
2. Enable in **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons** (search for *Minecraft JSON Import/Export*)


Export Guide 
---------------------------------------
- **Only exports cuboid objects** e.g. Object meshes must be rectangular prisms (8 vertices and 6 faces). The local mesh coordinates must be aligned to global XYZ axis. **Do not rotate the mesh vertices in edit mode.**
- **All cuboids must be separate objects.**
- **Apply rotations at the Object level (outside of mesh edit).** Only one axis can have a **net rotation** with 5 possible degree values: [-45, -22.5, 0, 22.5, 45]. What **net rotation** means is that the object can have any multiple of 90 deg rotations on any axis (because the object is still a cuboid), but only one axis can have a further rotation of values listed. Objects with invalid rotations will be rounded to their closest valid rotation. Examples of valid/invalid rotations:

|x   | y   | z  |       |
|----|---- |----|------ |
|0   |22.5 |0   | valid |
|90  |270  |45  | valid |
|90  |270  |135 | valid |
|45  |135  |0   | invalid (two net rotations) |
|30  |0    |0   | invalid (value not allowed) |

- **Apply all scale to objects before exporting.** Use `ctrl + A` to bring up Apply menu then hit `Apply > Scale`. (Also found in `Object > Apply > Scale` tab in viewport)
- **Recalculate normals if textures are on wrong faces.** Applying negative scales can sometimes flip face normals inside, which causes incorrect auto-generated texture colors. Recalculate normals on all meshes to fix (`Select All` > `Edit Mode` > `Select All` > `ctrl + shift + N` to recalculate and **uncheck inside**).

Example `.blend` files and generated `.json` models are in **examples** folder.


Export Options
---------------------------------------
|  Option  |  Default   | Description  |
|----------|------------|------------- |
| Selection Only | False | If True, export only selected objects|
| Recenter Coordinates | True | Recenters Blender origin `(0,0,0)` to Minecraft origin `(8,8,8)`|
| Rescale to Max | True | Rescale exported model so the largest axis fits the 48x48x48 Minecraft model volume.
| Recenter Model to Origin | True | Recenter model so its center is at the origin.
| Texture Subfolder | ""item"" | Subfolder for model texture path: `assets/minecraft/textures/[subfolder]` |
| Texture Name | | Name of texture generated `[name].png` (blank defaults to `.json` filename) |
| Export UVs | True | Exports face UVs |
| Generate Color Texture | True | Auto-textures solid material colors and generates a `.png` image texture exported alongside model (overwrites UVs). By default will get colors from all materials in the Blender file. |
| Only Use Exported Object Colors | False | When exporting auto-generated color texture, only use materials colors on exported objects (instead of all materials in file). |
| Minify .json | False | Enable options to reduce .json file size |
| Decimal Precision | 8 | Number of digits after decimal point in output .json (-1 to disable) |
| Export Bones | False | Export model in chunks by associated bones (experimental) |
| Export Animations | False | Export bone animations into a separate .json file (see docs, experimental) |


Import Options
---------------------------------------
|  Option  |  Default   | Description  |
|----------|------------|------------- |
| Import UVs | True | Import face UVs |
| Translate by (-8, -8, -8) | False | Fixed `(-8,-8,-8)` translation to convert from Minecraft `[-16,32]` space |
| Recenter to Origin | True | Centers model on Blender world origin (overrides translate option) |


Minecraft Geometry Restrictions Overview
---------------------------------------
Detailed overview: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Model
- Uses a Y-up coordinate system (Blender uses Z-up, exporter handles the conversion).
- Coordinates must be from [-16, 32]
- Single axis rotations with 5 possible values: [-45, -22.5, 0, 22.5, 45]
- Minecraft UV axis is top-left (0, 0) to bottom-right (16, 16) while Blender is bottom-left (0, 0) to top-right (1, 1)  
- Each face UVs specified as in format [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] where each value in range [0, 16]

Let's face it, the font used in Minecraft is superior to anything that exists on your paltry computer. The elegant pixels, the unique spacing, and the almost unreadable punctuation all add to its pixelated charm. Why not add that font to your computer or phone and enjoy that Minecraft-y goodness wherever you are?

This project is an attempt to distill those beautiful pixels into a font capable of running on your local device in any application that supports custom fonts. The font has been carefully recreated pixel-by-pixel, with great care given to the spacing and strokes to ensure that the font looks good in any application.

***Notice: This project is not affiliated with Minecraft or Mojang in any way and is exclusively a fan project. This font emulates the typeface of the font used in the Minecraft UI, but it does not include any assets or font files from the original game.***

## About this font

This is an OpenType font containing 195 glyphs carefully designed to look exactly like the characters in Minecraft. The font contains all the visible UTF-8 characters between U+0000 to U+00FF, which includes most Latin glyphs you'd use on a daily basis. I've also added a few extra glyphs like `☺` which are commonly used in the game.

What makes this different from other attempts at emulating the Minecraft bitmap font is that it takes into careful consideration how converting from a bitmap font to an OpenType font can affect metrics such as kerning, intended weight, and line height. Through a lot of experimenting, I've selected bounding metrics that best match the original look when rendered as a modern font.

Regular Weight             |  **Bold Weight**
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
| ![](images/glyphset.png) | ![](images/glyphset-bold.png) |

I've also added a bold version of each character that was designed with the same algorithm that Minecraft uses for bolding glyphs. Instead of just increasing the stroke weight like with a normal font, each character becomes thicker by shifting the pixels one pixel to the right and printing them overtop the original design. The end result is completely game-accurate and only mostly unreadable!

If you like this font but think that it would look better monospaced and with unnecessary ligatures, check out [Minecraft Mono](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Mono)!

## How to install

### Windows

Download the most recent `Minecraft.otf` and `Minecraft-Bold.otf` files from the [Releases](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font/releases) page. Right click on the downloaded font files and select **Install**. You might need administrative access to install fonts, depending on your machine.

### Mac

Download the most recent `Minecraft.otf` and `Minecraft-Bold.otf` files from the [Releases](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font/releases) page. Double click on the downloaded font files and select **Install Font** in the window that appears. More help available [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749).

## How to use

After following the installation instructions up above, simply select the ""Minecraft"" font in any application that supports custom fonts. You might need to restart the application or your computer for the font to appear.

## FAQ

### How were these characters generated?

The font was originally drafted by hand using [bitfontmaker2](https://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/). The set was then exported using their built in bitmap to TTF converter, and from there the resultant .ttf files were cleaned up and updated in [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/). Every subsequent character addition should be done using FontForge, though bitfontmaker2 is still a good tool for drafting up designs.

### Why doesn't this font contain more characters?

Each of these glyphs had to be copied over by hand as well as their bold equivalents, which takes time. The font contains most of the common latin characters you might use, with a goal of containing all of the visible UTF-8 characters between U+0000 to U+00FF. If you have a specific glyph that you would like added to the font, you are free to create an issue, though I make no promises that I will have the time to add it. In the future, someone smarter than me might make a script to directly convert the bitmap fonts stored as sprite sheets in Minecraft into modern vector fonts.

### Is there a monospaced version?

Absolutely, check out [Minecraft Mono](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Mono) for a monospaced version with updated glyphs and ligatures.

=============

For debugging it is often useful to record a player's actions and replay them
one or more times later.  This makes it possible to simulate multiplayer games
without having real people logging in.

To record a session:

$ ./chunkymonkey --record player.log ~/.minecraft/saves/World1

To replay a session:

$ ./chunkymonkey --replay player.log ~/.minecraft/saves/World1 &
$ java -jar Minecraft.jar  # start the first player (real human)
$ nc localhost 25565       # start the second player (replay from log file)

The recorded player will start when the second client connects to the server.
Use netcat or a similar tool to start an otherwise idle TCP connection to the
server.

On Minecraft Bedrock Edition, players on Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PS4/PS5 are limited to playing on 'Featured Servers' approved by Mojang/Microsoft. These players are not able to join servers via an IP/address. This is an issue for me and others, as the server community on Java edition was one of the major parts that made Minecraft what it was, and what also made what the servers that are now considered 'Mojang Server Partners' what they are today. I wanted to fix this, so I made a solution that anyone can setup easily.

BedrockConnect is an easy to use solution for Minecraft Bedrock Edition players on Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PS4/PS5 to join any server IP, while also having access to a serverlist that allows you to manage a list of servers. It doesn't require any downloads, just a few changes to settings.

Here's the final result in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz-XYXAxd8Q

Here's tutorials to get it setup yourself. It takes only a few minutes to get setup:

# FAQ

**How does it work?** In Minecraft Bedrock Edition, players on any version can join the available 'Featured Servers'. By using a DNS server, we can make the domains that are used to join these servers, and make them direct to the BedrockConnect serverlist server, rather than their actual servers.

The BedrockConnect serverlist server, is a specially made Minecraft server that serves the purpose of joining Minecraft servers. Yes, you join Minecraft servers, from a Minecraft server. The server can transfer you to the server you want, and you can store servers as well, just like a regular serverlist.

**What is a DNS server?** A DNS server is what devices uses to know what domain names go with what IP address. Your device sends the DNS server a domain name and asks what IP is associated with it, and the DNS server sends an IP back for the device to connect to. Commonly used ones include Google or Cloudflare DNS. Anyone can technically create a DNS server, and have it associate whatever IP they want to a domain. In this case, we make the 'Featured Server' domains direct to our own server.

**I don't trust your DNS server...** The public BedrockConnect DNS server only redirects the domains of the ""Featured Servers"" in Minecraft to the BedrockConnect serverlist. (Full list of records under the ""Using your own DNS server"" section) It's understandable though why some might not want to use a random DNS server.  If you fear a MITM attack, you can also verify any domains you fear the DNS server are overriding by pinging them in command line or another tool. If you still don't feel comfortable using the BedrockConnect DNS server, you can also make your own. Look under 'Using your own DNS server' further down this page for more on that.

**Some featured server aren't redirecting to the serverlist** If some featured servers are redirecting to the BedrockConnect serverlist, and some aren't, this can be an issue with the DNS cache on the device/game console not updating. Nothing can really be done except wait when on the game console for the cache to clear, as there isn't a manual way to do it on these devices.

Another possible issue is that some of the featured servers such the Hive, use DNSSEC, which is used to protect itself from being overidden by DNS servers such as BedrockConnect. This is still being tested, and seems to work on some people's consoles and not on others.

# Publicly available BedrockConnect instances

There are multiple BedrockConnect serverlist servers available that can be used, giving you multiple options to connect to. Currently, they do NOT share the same player database, so if you have added a server to your list on any of the given servers and connect to a different one, you will need to save that data again.

# Hosting your own serverlist server

If you want a full tutorial on how to host your own BedrockConnect server with a DNS server, watch the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW5X7-qnvLk

Or, if you're on Linux: https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/wiki/Setting-up-on-Linux

The instructions below will show how to run the barebone JAR.


**Requirements:**
- Java 8 or higher

Download the latest release of the BedrockConnect serverlist software here: https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/releases

Run the jar with the following command
```
java -jar BedrockConnect-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar nodb=true
```
(```nodb=true``` allows the software to run without a database. If you want to use a database, remove this argument)

The following arguments can be placed in the startup command to ajust settings:

| Argument  | Description | Default Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| mysql_host  | MySQL Host  | localhost |
| mysql_db | MySQL Database Name  | bedrock-connect |
| mysql_user | MySQL Username  | root |
| mysql_pass | MySQL Password  |  |
| server_limit | How many servers a new player can have in their serverlist  | 100 |
| port | Port of the server (Should only be changed for debugging on PC. Port needs to be on 19132 for the bypass to work on game consoles) | 19132 |
| bindip | IP that the BedrockConnect server will bind to | 0.0.0.0 |
| nodb | If true, use JSON files for data instead of MySQL | false |
| generatedns | If true, generate a DNS zone file using user input (Only needed if you're using the mod0Umleitung DNS software) | false |
| kick_inactive | If true, players will be kicked after 10 minutes of inactivity with the serverlist UI | true |
| custom_servers| Sets the path to a custom server file, for specifying your servers in the list for all players. See [custom servers](#defining-your-own-custom-servers). |  |
| user_servers | If true, players can add and remove servers on the serverlist. If false, the options are hidden. | true |
| featured_servers | If true, the featured servers will be displayed in the serverlist.  If false, the servers are hidden. | true |
| whitelist | Specify file containing list of whitelisted players. (Should be a text file with the player names specified on seperate lines) | |
| fetch_featured_ips | If true, dynamically grab the featured server IPs from the domain names. If false, a file ```featured_server_ips.json``` will be generated, containing the hard-coded featured server IPs, and to allow changing them if needed.  | true |
| language | Specify a file containing language customizations. See [guide for changing wording](#change-wording-of-serverlist) | |

MySQL example:
```
java -jar BedrockConnect-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar mysql_pass=test123 server_limit=10
```

# Defining your own custom servers

When hosting your own serverlist server, you add your own custom servers to the top of the serverlist for all players. To get started, create a JSON file and follow this format:
```json
[
	{
		""name"": ""My Custom Server 1"",
		""iconUrl"": ""https://i.imgur.com/3BmFZRE.png"",
		""address"": ""mc1.example.com"",
		""port"": 19132
	},
	{
		""name"": ""My Custom Server 2"",
		""iconUrl"": ""https://i.imgur.com/3BmFZRE.png"",
		""address"": ""mc2.example.com"",
		""port"": 19132
	}
]
```

You can also specify groups, such as the following format:
```json
[
        {
		""name"": ""My Server Group"",
		""iconUrl"": ""https://i.imgur.com/3BmFZRE.png"",
		""content"": [
			{
				""name"": ""Server in Group 1"",
				""iconUrl"": ""https://i.imgur.com/3BmFZRE.png"",
				""address"": ""mc1.example.com"",
				""port"": 19132
			},
		]
	},
	{
		""name"": ""My Custom Server 1"",
		""iconUrl"": ""https://i.imgur.com/3BmFZRE.png"",
		""address"": ""mc1.example.com"",
		""port"": 19132
	},
	{
		""name"": ""My Custom Server 2"",
		""iconUrl"": ""https://i.imgur.com/3BmFZRE.png"",
		""address"": ""mc2.example.com"",
		""port"": 19132
	}
]
```


Then, add this argument to your startup script: `custom_servers=[path to json file]`

The icon URL is not required, if omitted it will show the default icon.

# Change wording of serverlist

For cases where you want to change the wording/language of your BedrockConnect server, you can do this by creating a JSON file in the same directory as the BedrockConnect JAR. The contents of this file should contain the parts of the wording you want to overwrite. 

You can find all the options that be overwritten here: https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/blob/master/serverlist-server/src/main/resources/language.json

Example custom language file:
```json
{
	""main"": {
		""heading"": ""My Cool ServerList"",
		""connectBtn"" : ""Hop in a server!""
	},
	""disconnect"": {
		""exit"": ""Goodbye!""
	}
}
```

Once finished, you include it in your server by adding the following arguement to your startup command: ```language=my_lang.json``` (Replace ""my_lang"" with the name of your file"")

# Using your own DNS server

In the case where you want to use your own DNS server instead of the one I supplied, this is what zones you'll need to set your DNS to in order for BedrockConnect to work:

| Domain  | IP |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| geo.hivebedrock.network  | 104.238.130.180  |
| hivebedrock.network  | 104.238.130.180  |
| mco.mineplex.com | 104.238.130.180  | 
| play.inpvp.net | 104.238.130.180  |
| mco.lbsg.net | 104.238.130.180  |
| mco.cubecraft.net | 104.238.130.180  |
| play.galaxite.net | 104.238.130.180 |
| play.pixelparadise.gg | 104.238.130.180 |

*104.238.130.180 is the IP to the BedrockConnect serverlist server. If you are hosting your own BedrockConnect serverlist server as well, obviously use that IP instead*

Here's a script to setup BIND (DNS server software) on Linux: https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/blob/master/scripts/install-bind.sh

Current version: 1.3.1

Minecraft with real money!  

Ah, economy plugins... Without them, we would have no in game currency! But what if this in game currency... was also out-of-game currency?  

*Enter Satoshis!*
Coupled with the Bitcoin P2P digital currency, you can trade in game with real money!

The design is simple:  
1) Player starts with no money  
2) The player can add money to their account by sending Bitcoin to a certain address.  
3) The player can withdraw money from their account to any Bitcoin address.  
4) Trade takes place as usual, as the plugin links into vault. Any shop/purchase plugin supporting vault is supported here!  
5) Tax system allows for a ""Sales Tax"" on each money transfer. The settings for whether the buyer or the seller is held responsible for tax, and for tax rates, are available in the config.  

Commands:  

/money - List current amount of Bitcoin in your minecraft account.  
/transact <player> <amount> - Transfer's money from your account to the selected player's account.  
/deposit - Get a Bitcoin address to send a deposit to. The next transaction to that address will fund your account.  
/withdraw <address> [amount] - Transfers money from your account to your Bitcoin wallet. Must have at least the amount specified in the config. If the amount is left off, it will transfer all of your funds.  
/admin info - Print basic debugging and economy info.  
/admin reset - Delete and re-download the block chain.  
/syscheck - Verify that the current Bitcoin holdings tally with the balances of all in-game accounts.  
/credit <player> <amount> - Add the specified amount to the given player's balance

700,jrbudda/Vivecraft_110,Java,"Vivecraft for Minecraft 1.10.2
=========

This readme is intended for developers. For downloads and gameplay instructions please see the [official website](http://www.vivecraft.org/)


Using this Repository
========
 
 Vivecraft uses patches to avoid distributing Minecraft code. The build scripts are in Python 2.X.
 
 - Fork, checkout or download the repo using your Git method of choice.
 - Install Java JDK 1.8. The Java JRE will NOT work.
 - Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK directory
 - Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to your PATH environment variable
 - Install Python 2.7.x (NOT 3.x). Be sure to tick the 'add python to your PATH' option during install. [Download from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - Open a command prompt and navigate to the repo directory
 - Run install.bat
 
The install process (install.py) does a number of things:
 - It downloads MCP (Minecraft coder's pack) and extracts it to the \mcp9xx\ directory.
 - It downloads a ton of dependencies.
 - It merges Optifine into vanilla minecraft jar.
 - It decompiles and deobfuscates the combined minecraft/optifine into \mcp9xx\src\.minecraft_orig_nofix\
 - It applies any patches found in \mcppatches\ and copies the result to\mcp9xx\src\.minecraft_orig\
 - It applies all the patches found in \patches\ and copies the result to \mcp9xx\src\minecraft\. 
 - It copies all code files found in \src\ to \mcp9xx\src\minecraft\. 
 - It copies all files found in \assets\ to \mcp9xx\src\assets\.
 This directory is now the full 'Vivecraft' codebase.
 
If you use Eclipse you can open the workspace found in \mcp9xx\eclipse. You will have to correct the library path for the vanilla jar and realms jar, and also add libraries for JRift, json, asm, and launchwrapper, all of these can be found in the root /lib folder. To run the game from eclipse you also have to attach natives to the lwjgl jar (from lib/natives).

Make all changes to the game in the \mcp9xx\src\minecraft directory.

To update code to Github:
========
 - run getchanges.bat. This compares mcp9xx\src\minecraft to mcp9xx\src\minecraft_orig. patches are generated for modified files and copied to \patches\. Whole new files are copied to \src\.
 - Push to Github.
 
To build an installer:
========
 - run build.bat. This runs getchanges, build, and then create_install. Basically it takes the new files and patches and creates a jar. And then it uses the code and jsons found in \installer\ to make an installer.exe.

To update changes from github
========
  - After pulling changes from github run applychanges.bat. This backs up mcp9xx\src\minecraft to mcp9xx\src\minecraft_bak, and starts over by applying all patches in \patches\ to mcp9xx\src\minecraft_orig, and copies the result o mcp9xx\src\minecraft
  
Caveats - Maintaining Forge Compatibility
========
When Vivecraft is run with Forge, any public method can be called by any mod, and any vanilla class is up for grabs for ASM modification. To this end, please follow these guidelines in writing Vivecraft code:
 - Do not rename any vanilla methods, fields, or classes
 - Do not change the type or signatures of any vanilla members.
 - Keep modification to vanilla methods minimal, move code to your own methods, preferrably in your own files.

Additionally, vivecraft does not use bytecode manipulation at runtime to modify the vanilla classes (mostly), it replaces them wholesale in much the same way as optifine. It only replaces files that have been modified by the user, and it replaces them after Forge and Optifine have made their modifications to them. This means that any vanilla class you modify will NOT have any of Forge's code changes made to it at runtime. To fix this, the class must have all Forge's method calls added via reflection in Vivecraft. Optifine uses this method extensively and Vivecraft expands it. 

Before making ANY changes to a vanilla class file you should check to see:
  - Is the class already modified by Vivecraft? You can tell if there is a .patch file for it on github. If so: feel free to make any other changes.
  - Is the class already modified by Optifine? You can tell because there will usually be calls to Reflector.java. If Optifine has already made the Reflection calls, continue with your edits.
  - Is the class modfied by Forge? - Check Forge's github patches to see, Forge modifies many base classes but not all. If the class is not modified by Forge, feel free to edit it.
  - If the class is modified by Forge, and neither Vivecraft, nor Optifine have added the Reflection calls, you will have to do so along with your own changes. See Reflector.java for numerous examples.

Item bingo in Minecraft

![Item Bingo](https://i.imgur.com/7qXBAQK.png)

## What is minecraft bingo?
Minecraft Bingo is a gamemode in Minecraft in which teams battle in order to collect items on their bingo card.
The first team to reach a completed row, column or diagonal wins the game.
Collecting items is simply done through the vanilla game experience of minecraft.

## Usage
Players that have OP on the server have access to all commands. 
Before being able to start the game, a player needs to create teams with the /team command. 
Other settings can be configured as explained in the commands section below. 
As soon as the game is started, teams are scattered across the map (players within teams are grouped together). 
The teams work together to gather the items on their bingo card. 
If a team successfully completed the card, the game ends. 
When, however, the time limit is reached, a winner is decided based on the number of items collected by each of the teams. 
The team with the highest number of items wins, or the game ends in a tie.
Note that the bingo card can be right-clicked in order to view which items need to be gathered.

## Install
The plugin can be downloaded from one of the [releases](https://github.com/Extremelyd1/minecraft-bingo/releases) or compiled yourself using Spigot.
The plugin requires either a [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) or [Paper](https://papermc.io/) server running version 1.19. 
Move the `.txt` files and the `images/images.zip` in the `item_data` folder to `<server>/plugins/MinecraftBingo/item_data`. 
Then unzip the `images/images.zip` archive.
The first time you run the plugin a config file will be generated in `<server>/plugins/MinecraftBingo`, in which you can edit some configuration settings.

## Commands
#### Team manage command
- `/team [random|add|remove]`
  - `/team random <number of teams> [-e] [players...]` Create a set number of teams dividing the players randomly over them. If given a list of player names, it will only create teams with those players (or exclude those player if the flag `-e` is given).
  - `/team add <player name> <team name>` Add a player to a given team  
  Possible team names are: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Pink, Aqua, Orange, Gray
  - `/team remove <player name>` Remove a player from a given team

#### Game start/end commands
- `/start` Start the game
- `/end` End the game

#### Configuration commands  
- `/pvp` Enable/disable PvP
- `/maintenance` Enable maintenance mode (this will disallow all non-OP players from joining)
- `/wincondition <full|lines|lockout> [number]` Change the wincondition to either a full card, a number of lines (rows, columns or diagonals) to complete in order to win or lockout. 
  In case of 'lines' or 'lockout' you can specify a number to indicate how many lines needed to be completed, or after how many collections an item locks.
  (alias: `/wincon`)
- `/itemdistribution <S> <A> <B> <C> <D>` Change the item distribution scales, the number of S, A, B, C, and D tier items that appear on the bingo card. 
  These numbers must add up to 25. (aliases: `/itemdist`, `/distribution`, `/dist`)
- `/timer <enable|disable|length>` Enable/disable the timer or set the length of the timer (the length can be specified in hours/minutes/seconds, such as `/timer 10m` or `/timer 1h20m30s`)

#### Miscellaneous commands
- `/bingo` Check the items on the card
- `/card` Receive a new bingo card (if somehow lost)
- `/reroll` Re-roll the items on the bingo card
- `/coordinates [message]` Sends your current coordinates to your team, optionally with a message (aliases: `/coord`, `/coords`)
- `/all [message]` Allows players to talk to all players in the game (aliases: `/a`, `/g`, `/global`)
- `/teamchat [message]` Allows players to talk to their team members (alias: `/tc`)
- `/channel <team|global>` Allows players to switch the default chat channel that chat messages will be sent to (alias `/c`)
- `/join [team name]` Allows players to join a team by the given name

## World generation
The plugin offers the ability to pre-generate worlds to reduce chunk generation lag during gameplay.
This feature can be used both on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and on [Paper](https://papermc.io/), but will be significantly faster on Paper.
The following command can be used to manage this:
- `/generate <start world number> <number of worlds>` Start pre-generating the given number of worlds from the given index and storing them in zip format
- `/generate stop` Stop pre-generating worlds  

This command only works if the config value `pregeneration-mode` is enabled.
The config file also include two parameters that can tweak/boost the chunk generation based on the processing power of your machine.
The `ticks-per-cycle` parameter denotes the time between chunk generation cycles and `chunks-per-cycle` denotes how many chunks it should generate in a single cycle.
A lower `ticks-per-cycle` and higher `chunks-per-cycle` will require more RAM and processing speed.
Note that using this feature and increasing these parameters drastically may crash your server.

#### Snapshot support
TyphoonCore is able to load [TyphoonDep protocol-map modules](https://github.com/TyphoonMC/TyphoonDep/tree/master/protocol-map) to add a partial snapshots support.

All json files are loaded from the ""modules"" folder in the same directory as the TyphoonLimbo binary.

You can generate a protocol-map module with the [fetcher](https://github.com/TyphoonMC/TyphoonDep/tree/master/protocol-map/fetcher). Just pick the ""page"" link of your wanted version on [wiki.vg](http://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers) as argument of the fecther and the magic will happen.

### How to use
```shell
go get github.com/TyphoonMC/TyphoonCore
```

#### Example
```go
package main

import (
	""fmt""
	t ""github.com/TyphoonMC/TyphoonCore""
)

func main() {
	core := t.Init()
	core.SetBrand(""exampleserver"")

	core.On(func(e *t.PlayerJoinEvent) {
		msg := t.ChatMessage(""Welcome "")
		msg.SetExtra([]t.IChatComponent{
			t.ChatMessage(e.Player.GetName()),
			t.ChatMessage("" !""),
		})
		e.Player.SendMessage(msg)
	})

	core.Start()
}
```

703,Elikill58/Negativity,Java,"# Negativity

A Minecraft AntiCheat for **Spigot** (1.7.10 to 1.19) and **Sponge** ([more informations](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki#im-on-sponge-and-wtf-)) (*also works on fork of Spigot*).
It is also compatible with **Bungeecord** and **Velocity**.

You need to put the plugin on Spigot/Sponge even if you put it on your proxy.

## Informations

If you need help, you can: Contact me via Discord private messages (`Elikill58#0743`) or in my server ([join it here](https://discord.gg/KHRVTX2)).

Suggestions and bug reports can also be filled in [this repository issue tracker](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/issues).

A premium version is available. See [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/86874/) for download. You can read all differencies [here](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki/V1-and-V2-:-Description,-differencies-and-explainations).

## How to install ?

A complete wiki explain [how to install](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki/Installation) it on all platform (Spigot, Sponge, Bungeecord, Velocity)

## I want to test it before download !

You can check it on **play.negativity.fr** (server in 1.13.2, you can connect with 1.13.2 to 1.19). Warn: it can be offline.

## What are the detected cheat ?

We made a wiki for all [detected cheat](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki/Cheat) which explain what every hack does.

## How detection works ? What do you check ?

If they are enabled, I'm checking a lot of things : movement, action, packet ...

Else, I'm doing anything. So, if you don't need detection, disable it and you will keep resources.

## And for bad connection ? TPS drop ?

By default, if the player have a **ping higher than 200 ms**, it will not create alert.

Also by default, if the server is **less than 19 TPS**, alert will be disabled

704,benjick/Minecraft-Autobackup,Shell,"Minecraft Server AutoBackup for Linux
by Justin Smith
forked by Max Malm

Since you need to run you server in a screen, start it like this (or similar)

Vanilla:
screen -S minecraft java -Xmx2048M -Xms2048M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui

Bukkit:
screen -S minecraft java -Xmx2048M -Xms2048M -jar craftbukkit.jar nogui

Features

* Autobackup using the systems built in crontab and tar archiver.
* Autosaves before backup.
* Will notify you in game when a backup is progress and is completed. (Can be disabled with NOTIFY variable)
* Auto installs the cronjob required (this can be enabled/disabled by a setting)
* Will delete backups older than the specified amount of days
* If you change the update interval it will auto update the cronjob for you. (Each time you change it you must execute the script manually and it will update the cronjob with the new interval)
* SCP to remote location

Config Settings

<s> = String which must always be within quotes. eg. ""Hi There""
<n> = Number, should always and only ever be a number (Which shouldn't be within quotes like a string is)
<c> = Command, This executes a system command and the output is to be saved in the variable. (I don't advise anyone to edit these kind of variables unless you know what you are doing.)

* STAMP=""<c>"" - This is just the datetime stamp used when name the backup files. I wouldn't advise changing it but you can if you want. (the backups use the following format: ""$WORLD.$STAMP.tar.gz"" where $WORLD is the level-name value in your server.properties.)
* SCREENNAME=""<s>"" - This is required by autosave so it knows where to send the save-all command. (requires screen, and for the server to be started as a screen session.)
* AUTOSAVE=<n> - This is whether autosave is to be enabled or not. For it to work you must have 'screen' installed and must run the server in a screen session.
* NOTIFY=<n> - Enable/Disable in-game notifications.
* BACKUPDIR=""<s>"" - This is the name of the backup dir that will be created for you in your server directory.
* PROPFILE=""<s>"" - This is the name of your servers properties file that contains the variable ""level-name"", which is needed to know which world is to be backed up.
* CRONJOB=<n> - This is the toggle for the CronJob manager i did. Enabled it will auto install and update the cronjob needed for it to run every so often. Disabled, being able to disable it is so that if your host doesn't allow users to use crontab, you won't keep getting stupid messages saying that you can't. Also if the host provides a control panel where you can add cronjobs, then make sure this is disabled ( set to 0 ) and add it manually.
* MAILTO=""<s>"" - Set this to your email address if you want to be sent notifications whenever there is an error with the script.
* UPDATEMINS=<n> - This is how often (in minutes) you want the script to do backups. Hourly = 60, Daily = 1440.
* OLDBACKUPS=<n> - This will tell the script how old the backups must be before removal. Default is 3 days.
* LOGIT=<n> - This will Enable/Disable the scripts logging. Enabled it will tell what it is doing step by step. Disabled it will do quiet execution. (Enabling this is recommended when debugging)
* SCP=<n> - 1 enables SCP to remote host, 0 disables it. You will need to set up key-based auth between the hosts (see http://www.hostingrails.com/HowTo-SSH-SCP-without-a-password). Please note that files on the remote server will not be deleted according to OLDBACKUPS=<n>.
* SCPUSERNAME=""<s>"" - Username to use for remote host.
* SCPHOST=""<s>"" - Hostname to use for remote host.
* SCPPORT=""<s>"" - Post to use for remote host.
* SCPPATH=""<s>"" - Path to dir where the backups should be placed. The SCPUSERNAME must have write access and this dir must be created manually."
705,UnknownShadow200/ClassiCube,C,"ClassiCube is a custom Minecraft Classic and ClassiCube client written in C that works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, Haiku, and in a web browser.<br>
**It is not affiliated with (or supported by) Mojang AB, Minecraft, or Microsoft in any way.**

* Lightweight, minimal memory usage compared to original Minecraft Classic
* Much better performance than original Minecraft Classic
* Works with effectively all graphics cards that support OpenGL or Direct3D 9

#### What ClassiCube isn't
* It does not work with Minecraft Java or Bedrock edition servers
* It does not have a survival mode (nor will such a mode be added)
* It does not reimplement Minecraft Classic versions before 0.30

#### System requirements

* macOS: 10.5 or later (can be compiled to work with 10.3/10.4 though)
* Linux: libcurl and libopenal
* Android: 2.3 or later

**Note:** When running from within VirtualBox, disable Mouse Integration, otherwise the camera will not work properly

#### Instructions
Initially, you will need to run ClassiCube.exe to download the required assets from minecraft.net. 
Just click 'OK' to the dialog menu that appears when you start the launcher.

**Singleplayer**
Run ClassiCube.exe, then click Singleplayer at the main menu.

**Multiplayer**
Run ClassiCube.exe. You can connect to LAN/locally hosted servers, ~~minecraft.net servers,~~ and classicube.net servers through the launcher.

###### *Stuck with OpenGL 1.1 due to old graphics hardware?*
If you're on Windows, you should first try using the MESA software renderer from [here](http://download.qt.io/development_releases/prebuilt/llvmpipe/windows/). Typically though, this occurs because you have not installed GPU drivers.

Otherwise, you will have to [compile the game yourself](#using-visual-studio-command-line). Don't forget to add `-DCC_BUILD_GL11` to the compilation command line so that the compiled game supports OpenGL 1.1.

## Compiling - Windows

##### Using Visual Studio
Open ClassiCube.sln *(File -> Open -> Project/Solution)* and compile it *(Build -> Build Solution)*.

If you get a ```The Windows SDK version 5.1 was not found``` compilation error, [see here for how to fix](doc/compile-fixes.md#visual-studio-unsupported-platform-toolset)

##### Using Visual Studio (command line)
1. Use 'Developer Tools for Visual Studio' from Start Menu
2. Navigate to directory with game's source code
3. Enter `cl.exe *.c /link user32.lib gdi32.lib crypt32.lib ws2_32.lib wininet.lib winmm.lib dbghelp.lib shell32.lib comdlg32.lib /out:ClassiCube.exe`

##### Using MinGW-w64
I am assuming you used the installer from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/
1. Install MinGW-W64
2. Use either *Run Terminal* from Start Menu or run *mingw-w64.bat* in the installation folder
3. Navigate to directory with game's source code
4. Enter `gcc *.c -o ClassiCube.exe -mwindows -lws2_32 -lwininet -lwinmm -limagehlp -lcrypt32`

##### Using MinGW
I am assuming you used the installer from http://www.mingw.org/
1. Install MinGW. You need mingw32-base-bin and msys-base-bin packages.
2. Run *msys.bat* in the *C:\MinGW\msys\1.0* folder.
3. Navigate to directory with game's source code
4. Enter `gcc *.c -o ClassiCube.exe -mwindows -lws2_32 -lwininet -lwinmm -limagehlp -lcrypt32`

##### Using TCC
I am assuming you used `tcc-0.9.27-win64-bin.zip` from https://bellard.org/tcc/
1. Extract the .zip file
2. In `ExtMath.C`, change `fabsf` to `fabs` and `sqrtf` to `sqrtf`
3. In TCC's `include/math.h`, remove the inline definition for `fabs` at around line 217
4. In TCC's `lib/kernel32.def`, add missing `RtlCaptureContext`
5. Add missing include files from `winapi-full-for-0.9.27.zip` as required
6. ???

Easy, isn't it?

## 🐟 Docker
You can now run Obsidian using Docker! As of right now, no image is available on DockerHub yet, but it will be sometime soon.

For now, to run Obsidian on Docker you will have to follow the following steps:
1. Clone Obsidian `git clone https://github.com/ObsidianMC/Obsidian.git`
2. Go to Obsidian's cloned directory `cd Obsidian`
3. Build the docker image `docker build . -t obsidian`
4. Run the container `docker run -d -p YOUR_HOST_PORT:25565 -v YOUR_SERVERFILES_PATH:/files --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME obsidian`
5. Obsidian will pregenerate a config file. Fill it out in `YOUR_SERVERFILES_PATH/config.json`
6. Start Obsidian's container again. `docker restart YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME`

### Docker Compose
There's also docker-compose support.
1. Clone Obsidian `git clone https://github.com/ObsidianMC/Obsidian.git`
2. Go to Obsidian's cloned directory `cd Obsidian`
3. Run `docker-compose up -V` to generate the `config.json`
4. Edit your `docker-compose.yml` file, along with `files/config.json`
5. `docker-compose up -Vd` to have the server run! The world, plugin and other server related files will be created in the `files` directory.

707,Ninjabrain1/Ninjabrain-Bot,Java,"# Ninjabrain Bot
An accurate stronghold calculator for Minecraft speedrunning. Achieves better results than regular calculators by accounting for user error and stronghold generation mechanics. See [triangulation.pdf](https://github.com/Ninjabrain1/Ninjabrain-Bot/blob/main/triangulation.pdf) for an explanation of the underlying mathematics.

![NinjabrainBot](https://i.imgur.com/oLJo3Cn.png)

## Getting started

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Ninjabrain1/Ninjabrain-Bot/releases/latest) and run the jar. To use the calculator, throw an ender eye, look at it, and press F3+C, and repeat for as many eyes as you like. The calculator will give you a certainty percentage of how confident it is that the predicted location is correct. If you want the certainty improved you should also change the standard deviation in the settings (see the FAQ down below for how to do this). 

If you are used to perfect travel and want the same accuracy you need to set hotkeys for ""+0.01/-0.01 to last angle"" in the advanced options, and calibrate your standard deviation (can also be done in the advanced options).

## Video guide

[Full tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx8i7e5lu7g)  by Four

## Features
* Most accurate known triangulation algorithm
    * Accounts for user error and all known stronghold generation mechanics
    * The certainty value describes how much the prediction should be trusted
* Subpixel adjustment
* Evaluation of blind coords (press F3+C in the nether)
* Fossil divine
    * Look at the fossil start and press F3+I to get the divine coords
    * Works with blind coord evaluation
    * Ender eye throws can be combined with divine for increased precision
* OBS overlay (auto hides in OBS when it's not showing anything)
* Lots of quality of life features

## History

Ninjabrain bot was first created in November 2020, in the era of Throwpro. The bot was created because the calculators at the time were too inaccurate, especially for calculated travel which was just beeing pioneered at the time. The two most common alternatives, Throwpro and FastStronghold, used models that were too simple and were not accurate at long distances. However, back then Ninjabrain bot only existed in a more primitive form, as a twitch chat bot. The first example of it being used in a real run can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/zK96gjkLTGc?t=880).

## FAQ

#### Is this legal to use in speedruns?
Yes, as of the calculator unban 2021-12-09 it is legal for runs submitted on speedrun.com.

#### The calculator said it was 100% certain but still missed the stronghold, what went wrong?
You most likely moved when you were throwing one of the eyes. It takes way longer than most people think for the player to fully come to a stop, even when your coordinates in F3 are completely stationary you still have to wait a while before throwing the eye (because of weird client-server desync). If you want to come to a stop quickly I recommend pushing yourself into a corner between two blocks, this also seems to prevent the aforementioned client-server desync. 

#### Can I do subpixel adjustment, like in perfect travel, with the bot?
Yes. Under advanced options in the settings you can set hotkeys for ""+0.01 to last angle"" and ""-0.01 to last angle"". Pressing those hotkeys will manually change the angle of the last F3+C you did. So for example, if your resolution is 1920x1027 and your eye has a wide middle eye-slit, you would press the ""+0.01 to last angle""-hotkey to adjust the angle. See the [perfect travel document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTMOIiS-Hl6_giEB0IQ5ki7UV-gvUXnNmoxhYoSgEAA/edit#heading=h.agb0mdup7ims) for more details.

#### What does the ""Display stronghold location"" setting mean?
It is just a setting that says how the stronghold location should be presented, it does not impact the accuracy of the calculator in any way. 
* **(4, 4)** will show you the coordinates of the starter staircase
* **(8, 8)** will show you the coordinates of (8, 8) in the stronghold chunk (the center of the chunk)
* **Chunk** will show you the chunk coordinates of the stronghold

#### What is ""Standard deviation"" in the settings?
Simply put, the standard deviation describes how accuretely you measure ender eye angles. The better you are at measuring ender eyes the lower the standard deviation should be. Setting the standard deviation to a small value means that the bot will trust your readings more, but setting the standard deviation too low means that the bot will be overconfident in its results. To find out your optimal standard deviation you can use the ""Calibrate standard deviation"" funciton available in the settings. Each players own standard deviation depends on a lot of factors such as FOV, resolution, mouse sensitivity, and experience measuring ender eyes, but the value should typically be in the range
* 0.050 - 0.200, if you're measuring eyes in quake pro
* 0.020 - 0.040, if you're measuring eyes in 30 FOV
* 0.005 - 0.010, if you're measuring eyes in 30 FOV and use subpixel adjustment

#### What is ""Show angle errors"" in the settings?
Angle errors tell you how wrongly you measured each ender eye (assuming that the predicted stronghold location is correct). This can be used to practice your ender eye measuring accuracy by trying to get as low errors as possible. It can also be used as a sanity check in runs, if the angle errors are abnormally large you may have measured something wrong, or moved while you were throwing one of the eyes.

#### What is ""Use advanced stronghold statistics"" in the settings?
""Advanced stronghold statistics"" will use the existence of other strongholds and the fact that the eye points towards the closest one to make a better prediction. This improves the accuracy and it should be turned on for 99.9% of users. 

#### What is ""Show direction to stronghold"" in the settings?
With this setting enabled the bot will tell you the direction you need to go to get to the stronghold. If you press F3+C while looking down the bot will tell you what direction the stronghold is from your current position, which is useful if you have gone off angle while traveling. This will also update the distance to the stronghold, and can be done in both the overworld and the nether (in the nether you don't have to look down, however). The stronghold direction is presented as
both a raw angle, as well as a relative angle (meaning how much leftward or rightward you have to turn to be on the right angle).

#### What is the ""Lock calculator"" hotkey in the settings?
Pressing this hotkey will toggle ""Locked mode"", with this mode enabled:
- Hotkeys for Reset, Undo, and subpixel adjustment will be disabled, so that you do not change the result by accident.
- If ""Auto reset when idle for 15 minutes"" is enabled, the calculator will not auto reset.
- Pressing F3+C will not count as another eye throw, but will rather update the distance and direction to the
stronghold from your current location (keep in mind that in order to see the direction to the stronghold you have to enable ""Show direction to stronghold"" in the settings).

*Survival Mode As It Should've Been*

### About

TerraFirmaCraft (TFC) is a total conversion mod that overhauls and reinvents survival mode. The goal of the mod is to create a believable, challenging survival experience, in a brand new immersive setting. It completely overhauls Minecraft world generation - from adding plate tectonics, to flowing rivers, to mountain ranges, to varied and diverse forests, flora, and fauna. Below is a list of some of the features of this mod:

- The underground has been completely reimagined, with layers of different types of rock, and massive sparse ore deposits of several different types.
- A fully fledged technology tree, from pottery and pit kilns, to charcoal production, producing iron with a bloomery, steel making and more.
- Seasons, weather, and a realistic climate and calendar model cause the player to need to stockpile food for winter to survive.
- The world is alive, with many different plants, wild crops, wild fruits, animals - both passive and predators - to find
- The player must manage their food's expiration, nutrition, and thirst using our detailed food and cooking mechanics.

In order to understand all of these new features, TerraFirmaCraft comes with a detailed in-game Field Guide, which is available from the moment you spawn in, and will guide you through the art of surviving in this brand-new world.

# XAHK
Auto Key Clicker for Minecraft under request from [Xisumavoid](https://www.youtube.com/c/XisumavoidMC) that allows you to use your computer at the same time. Developed for use with vanilla Minecraft and works with all versions. Originally developed by [monpjc](https://github.com/monpjc).

- [Features](#features)
- [Installation and Usage](#installation-and-usage)
- [YouTube Video](#youtube-video)
- [Platform Support](#platform-support)
- [License](#license)
- [Links](#links)


## Features
Allows running the Minecraft game client and interacting with the world while the user is away from their computer. XAHK will send a stream of keyboard and mouse inputs to a target game window as if the user was playing the game. It features many different modes of AFK farming, including:
- AFK Fishing
- AFK Concrete Convertion
- AFK Mob Grinding
- and more!

The biggest feature is that you can use other apps on your comptuer while XAHK is running, all thanks to the power of AHK!


## Installation and Usage
1. Download the latest release of the XAHK executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/histefanhere/XAHK/releases)
2. Run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions; the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/-wKW0OovGK4?t=280) by [xisumavoid](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU9pX8hKcrx06XfOB-VQLdw) also contains some additional instructions.


## YouTube Video
Xisumavoid made a video about a (now outdated) fish farm design, and featured the original auto clicker in the video:

[![YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-wKW0OovGK4/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/-wKW0OovGK4?t=280 ""Click to play on YouTube"")


## Platform Support
Although Minecraft runs on multiple platforms, this software requires AutoHotkey which supports *Windows only*.

Linux players may find an alternative by using a [shell script](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/bu4gka/linux_autoclicker_bash_script_useful_for_afk/).

Mac players can use MacOS's built-in accessibiltiy features and a full-size keyboard with a numeric keypad:
1. Open System Preferences
2. Go to Accessibility → Pointer Control → Alternate Control Methods and enable ""Mouse Keys""
3. In Minecraft, position your avatar for the activity (fishing, for example) and press ⌃5️⃣  (control+5, on the numpad) to send a ""right click""
4. Now tap 0️⃣  (on the numpad) to simulate ""hold right click""; note that you cannot switch applications as with XAHK


## License
The script is licensed under the terms of the GPL Open Source license and is available for free. View the [LICENSE](https://github.com/histefanhere/XAHK/blob/master/LICENSE) document for more details.

## About bridge.

bridge. is a powerful **add-on editor** designed to speed up your development process. It provides a rich editing experience for all files inside behavior and resource packs (JavaScript, JSON and functions) and provides a **powerful work environment**.
Unleash the full power of add-ons with bridge. plugins and make use of rich auto-completions provided as you navigate through a file. **Creating Minecraft add-ons was never more convenient!**

## Why _you_ should use bridge.

Most importantly, JSON editors like bridge. guarantee that you cannot write invalid JSON.
Additionally, ""bridge."" has a few more specific features which other editors do not offer:

-   bridge. interacts seamlessly with Minecraft and loads behavior packs and the corresponding resource pack from the com.mojang folder automatically
-   You cannot make general file structure mistakes because rich auto-completions guide you through the file
-   You do not need to study vanilla files and/or the incorrect documentation to find out which arguments a component has
-   Support for plugins: From custom components to searching files - bridge. plugins can do almost anything
-   Developing is generally significantly faster

## Feature Overview

#### General

-   Create new behavior packs and resource packs with an automatically generated manifest.json
-   Create new behavior pack and resource pack files through a clear interface
-   Package your behavior pack with only one click

#### Editor

-   Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo and all other features you would expect
-   Powerful shortcuts to reorder and navigate through a JSON file
-   JSON displays as a tree structure with collapsible/expandable elements
-   Easily restructure JSON files by dragging elements
-   Beautiful syntax highlighting for all behavior pack files
-   Snippets to quickly import common JSON patterns
-   Error/Mistake detection and auto-fixes for some of them
-   bridge. file structure predictions for users who want to be even faster writing add-ons

#### Auto-Completions

-   Rich auto-completions for entities, loot tables, trades, spawn rules, biomes, items, blocks, recipes, features, feature rules, animations and animation controllers
-   Handcrafted: We don't trust the Minecraft documentation and you shouldn't either. That's why we wrote all suggestions by hand
-   Context sensitive: bridge. proposes different data depending on what you wrote before. Adding e.g. a new item results in the corresponding identifier being proposed whenever an item identifier is a valid value throughout your behavior and resource pack files.
-   Ability to switch between auto-completions for multiple Minecraft versions seamlessly: We always support the latest stable release and the latest beta

#### Debug Log Explorer

-   A perfect tool for browsing content errors
-   Filter by tags or search for specific logs
-   Open affected files with only one click

#### Documentation

-   Easy access to the Minecraft add-on documentation
-   Shortcut to lookup specific components in your file
-   And more features to come...!

#### Settings

-   Tabs vs. Spaces: You get to choose how we generate your files
-   Light & Dark Theme with corresponding syntax highlighter
-   Set a default project to be opened automatically when you open bridge.
-   Choose between auto-completions for multiple Minecraft versions
-   Collection of options to customize your developing experience

#### JavaScript Plugins

-   Create new menus, windows and notifications
-   Add new file types
-   Hook into a variety of different events
-   Develop your own custom add-on syntax
-   [Library](https://github.com/solvedDev/bridge-plugins) with existing plugins to download from within bridge.

## Quick Start ##

* You may need to migrate your account to a Microsoft Account in order to update the launcher to install 1.17.1.

* Use the Minecraft launcher to use the Minecraft Java Edition

![image_22](images/image_22.png)

* Visit the [Releases Section](https://github.com/tgraupmann/MinecraftChromaMod/releases) to run the installers.

* Use the Minecraft Forge Universal Installer for client and server

* Use the mod installer that matches the Minecraft Forge version

* To run a local Minecraft server modify the `%APPDATA%\.minecraft\eula.txt` to accept.

```
eula=true
```

* To run Minecraft as a dedicated server and use Chroma on the clients, install the [server mod](https://github.com/tgraupmann/MinecraftChromaModServer/releases) on the server.

The client mod with Chroma will be allowed because the `modid` matches on server and client.

* To run a dedicated server, run the following in the `command-prompt`.

```
CD %appdata%\.minecraft
CALL java -Xmx4096M -jar libraries\net\minecraft\server\1.17.1\server-1.17.1.jar nogui
```

* Or put a batch file in your `.minecraft` folder to start the server.

**run_minecraft_server.cmd**
```
CALL java -Xmx4096M -jar libraries\net\minecraft\server\1.17.1\server-1.17.1.jar nogui
```

* The server will not be able to run the client mod. So you'll want to uninstall the client mod on the server and install the server mod on the server.

* Connect to Minecraft dedicated servers using port: `25565`.

## Setup and Build ###

This section is only needed to build a new mod installer or to make changes to the mod.

* Install [JDK 16 or better](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

* You can also use [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk16). Use `Latest release jdk-16.2+7` or better.

![image_9](images/image_9.png)

* The installer can set the JAVA_HOME for you.

![image_23](images/image_23.png)

* Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the 64-bit version of the JDK. Gradle will report out of memory with the 32-bit JDK version which can be fixed in the `gradle.properties` file if you have to.

The path will vary depending on the JAVA version that you install.

```
JAVA_HOME
C:\Program Files\Eclipse Foundation\jdk-16.0.2.7-hotspot\
```

![image_8](images/image_8.png)

* Install the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/)

* Install the latest MinecraftForge `server` and `client` using the [Windows Installer](http://files.minecraftforge.net/)

**Above: Install the Server and Client**

* Make sure you do both for the Minecraft Forge handshake to work.

* That means double-click `forge-1.17.1-37.0.108-installer.jar` and use the UI to install both.

![image_10](images/image_10.png)

![image_11](images/image_11.png)

**Get the mod**

* Download the Minecraft Forge [MDK](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/)

![image_14](images/image_14.png)

* Extract the MDK to a folder like:
```C:\Public\forge-1.17.1-37.0.108-mdk```

![image_15](images/image_15.png)

* Make sure the path isn't too long to avoid compile errors.

**Check that the MDK can build and run**

* Use Start->Run, enter `cmd`, and press `OK`.

```cmd```

![image_12](images/image_12.png)

* CD to the extracted folder Ie.

```
CD ""C:\Public\forge-1.17.1-37.0.108-mdk""
```

![image_16](images/image_16.png)

**Generate Eclipse Project**

```
gradlew genEclipseRuns
```

![image_17](images/image_17.png)

**Start the mod (on the command-line)**

```
gradlew runClient
```

![image_18](images/image_18.png)

## Manually Merge Changes

* With a properly setup developer environment that can compile MCF mods, now we need to make sure the Chroma Mod has the latest updates.

* Compare the `MDK` changes with the `MinecraftChromaMod`

* Unfortunately, every minor .x release will have class name and package namespace changes that need manually merged.

![image_20](images/image_20.png)

![image_21](images/image_21.png)

* Likely there will also be minor build changes that can be copied over.

* Use [Winmerge](https://winmerge.org/) or your favorite diff tool to manually merge in those changes.

![image_19](images/image_19.png)

* With all the changes merged, you can continue to build the Chroma mod.

**Now repeat the steps to run the Chroma MOD sample**

* Open a command-prompt and navigate to the project checkout folder for *this* repository. Wherever you cloned - https://github.com/tgraupmann/MinecraftChromaMod

* Use Start->Run, enter `cmd`, and press `OK`.

```cmd```

![image_12](images/image_12.png)

* CD to the checkout folder Ie.

```
CD ""C:\Public\MinecraftChromaMod""
```

![image_13](images/image_13.png)

**Generate Eclipse Project**

```
gradlew genEclipseRuns
```

**Launch Eclipse**

**Use the `File->Import` menu item**

![image_1](images/image_1.png)

**Select `Gradle\Existing Gradle Project` and click `Next`**

![image_2](images/image_2.png)

**Browse to the `MinecraftChromaMod` folder and click `Finish`**

![image_3](images/image_3.png)

**If the import is successful, the project shouldn't have any compile errors.**

![image_4](images/image_4.png)

**Use the `Run` toolbar drop down**

![image_5](images/image_5.png)

**Select `Run Configurations...`**

![image_6](images/image_6.png)

**Start the mod (from Eclipse)**

* Select the `Java Application` -&gt; `runClient` and click `Run`

![image_7](images/image_7.png)

**Start the mod (on the command-line)**

```
gradlew runClient
```

**Build the `build\libs\modid-1.0.jar`**

```
gradlew build
```

**Build the installer with InnoSetup**

719,DimensionalDevelopment/Rift,Java,
720,awesome-release/docker-minecraft-server,Shell,"## Verified to work in Release
This project is based on [https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server)

No modifications were necessary for this project to run in Release. However, in the Release Application Template it is necessary to adjust a few things. 

First, create an ELB to expose port 25565 with a simple hostname under the minecraft service. The minecraft service section of your Application Template should look like this:

```
services:
- name: minecraft
  image: itzg/minecraft-server
  ports:
  - port: '25565'
    type: node_port
    target_port: '25565'
    loadbalancer: true
  hostname: minecraft-${env_id}-lb-${domain}
```
This will expose port 25565 directly via an ELB to the Internet.

You should also increase the memory available for this container in Release by editing the resources section of your Applicaiton Template. In this example I've used 3Gb.

```
resources:
  cpu:
    limits: 1000m
    requests: 100m
  memory:
    limits: 3Gi
    requests: 100Mi
  replicas: 1
```
For more information on editing a Release Application Template, please refer to the documentation: [Release Application Template Documentation](https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template).

This docker image provides a Minecraft Server that will automatically download the latest stable
version at startup. You can also run/upgrade to any specific version or the
latest snapshot. See the _Versions_ section below for more information.

To simply use the latest stable version, run

    docker run -d -p 25565:25565 --name mc -e EULA=TRUE itzg/minecraft-server

where the standard server port, 25565, will be exposed on your host machine.

If you want to serve up multiple Minecraft servers or just use an alternate port,
change the host-side port mapping such as

    docker run -p 25566:25565 ...

will serve your Minecraft server on your host's port 25566 since the `-p` syntax is
`host-port`:`container-port`.

Speaking of multiple servers, it's handy to give your containers explicit names using `--name`, such as

    docker run -d -p 25565:25565 --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

With that you can easily view the logs, stop, or re-start the container:

    docker logs -f mc
        ( Ctrl-C to exit logs action )

    docker stop mc

    docker start mc
*Be sure to always include `-e EULA=TRUE` in your commands, as Mojang/Microsoft requires EULA acceptance.*

## Looking for a Bedrock Dedicated Server

For Minecraft clients running on consoles, mobile, or native Windows, you'll need to
use this image instead:

[itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server)

## Interacting with the server

[RCON](http://wiki.vg/RCON) is enabled by default, so you can `exec` into the container to
access the Minecraft server console:

```
docker exec -i mc rcon-cli
```

Note: The `-i` is required for interactive use of rcon-cli.

To run a simple, one-shot command, such as stopping a Minecraft server, pass the command as
arguments to `rcon-cli`, such as:

```
docker exec mc rcon-cli stop
```

_The `-i` is not needed in this case._

In order to attach and interact with the Minecraft server, add `-it` when starting the container, such as

    docker run -d -it -p 25565:25565 --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

With that you can attach and interact at any time using

    docker attach mc

and then Control-p Control-q to **detach**.

For remote access, configure your Docker daemon to use a `tcp` socket (such as `-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375`)
and attach from another machine:

    docker -H $HOST:2375 attach mc

Unless you're on a home/private LAN, you should [enable TLS access](https://docs.docker.com/articles/https/).

## EULA Support

Mojang now requires accepting the [Minecraft EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula). To accept add

        -e EULA=TRUE

such as

        docker run -d -it -e EULA=TRUE -p 25565:25565 --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

## Timezone Configuration

You can configure the timezone to match yours by setting the `TZ` environment variable:

        -e TZ=Europe/London

such as:

        docker run -d -it -e TZ=Europe/London -p 25565:25565 --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

Or mounting `/etc/timezone` as readonly (not supported on Windows):

        -v /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro

such as:

        docker run -d -it -v /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro -p 25565:25565 --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

## Attaching data directory to host filesystem

In order to readily access the Minecraft data, use the `-v` argument
to map a directory on your host machine to the container's `/data` directory, such as:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ...

When attached in this way you can stop the server, edit the configuration under your attached `/path/on/host`
and start the server again with `docker start CONTAINERID` to pick up the new configuration.

## Versions

To use a different Minecraft version, pass the `VERSION` environment variable, which can have the value

- LATEST (the default)
- SNAPSHOT
- or a specific version, such as ""1.7.9""

For example, to use the latest snapshot:

    docker run -d -e VERSION=SNAPSHOT ...

or a specific version:

    docker run -d -e VERSION=1.7.9 ...

When using ""LATEST"" or ""SNAPSHOT"" an upgrade can be performed by simply restarting the container.
During the next startup, if a newer version is available from the respective release channel, then
the new server jar file is downloaded and used. _NOTE: over time you might see older versions of
the server jar remain in the `/data` directory. It is safe to remove those._

## Running Minecraft server on different Java version

To use a different version of Java, please use a docker tag to run your Minecraft server.

| Tag name       | Description                                 | Linux        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| latest         | **Default**. Uses Java version 8 update 212 | Alpine Linux |
| adopt14        | Uses Java version 14 latest update          | Alpine Linux |
| adopt13        | Uses Java version 13 latest update          | Alpine Linux |
| adopt11        | Uses Java version 11 latest update          | Alpine Linux |
| openj9         | Uses Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM                     | Alpine Linux |
| openj9-nightly | Uses Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM testing builds      | Alpine Linux |
| multiarch      | Uses Java version 8 latest update           | Debian Linux |

For example, to use a Java version 13:

    docker run --name mc itzg/minecraft-server:adopt13

Keep in mind that some versions of Minecraft server can't work on the newest versions of Java. Also, FORGE doesn't support openj9 JVM implementation.

## Healthcheck

This image contains [mc-monitor](https://github.com/itzg/mc-monitor) and uses
its `status` command to continually check on the container's. That can be observed
from the `STATUS` column of `docker ps`

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS                                 NAMES
b418af073764        mc                  ""/start""            43 seconds ago      Up 41 seconds (healthy)   0.0.0.0:25565->25565/tcp, 25575/tcp   mc
```

You can also query the container's health in a script friendly way:

```
> docker container inspect -f ""{{.State.Health.Status}}"" mc
healthy
```

Some orchestration systems, such as Portainer, don't allow for disabling the default `HEALTHCHECK` declared by this image. In those cases you can approximate the disabling of healthchecks by setting the environment variable `DISABLE_HEALTHCHECK` to `true`.

## Autopause (experimental)

### Description

> EXPERIMENTAL: this feature only works with default bridge networking using official Docker distributions. Host networking and container management software, such as Portainer, and NAS solutions do not seem to provide compatible networking.

There are various bug reports on [Mojang](https://bugs.mojang.com) about high CPU usage of servers with newer versions, even with few or no clients connected (e.g. [this one](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149018), in fact the functionality is based on [this comment in the thread](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149018?focusedCommentId=593606&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-593606)).

An autopause functionality has been added to this image to monitor whether clients are connected to the server. If for a specified time no client is connected, the Java process is stopped. When knocking on the server port (e.g. by the ingame Multiplayer server overview), the process is resumed. The experience for the client does not change.

Of course, even loaded chunks are not ticked when the process is stopped.

From the server's point of view, the pausing causes a single tick to take as long as the process is stopped, so the server watchdog might intervene after the process is continued, possibly forcing a container restart. To prevent this, ensure that the `max-tick-time` in the `server.properties` file is set correctly.

On startup the `server.properties` file is checked and, if applicable, a warning is printed to the terminal. When the server is created (no data available in the persistent directory), the properties file is created with the Watchdog disabled.

A starting, example compose file has been provided in [examples/docker-compose-autopause.yml](examples/docker-compose-autopause.yml).

### Enabling Autopause

Enable the Autopause functionality by setting:

```
-e ENABLE_AUTOPAUSE=TRUE
```

There are 4 more environment variables that define the behaviour:
* `AUTOPAUSE_TIMEOUT_EST`, default `3600` (seconds)
describes the time between the last client disconnect and the pausing of the process (read as timeout established)
* `AUTOPAUSE_TIMEOUT_INIT`, default `600` (seconds)
describes the time between server start and the pausing of the process, when no client connects inbetween (read as timeout initialized)
* `AUTOPAUSE_TIMEOUT_KN`, default `120` (seconds)
describes the time between knocking of the port (e.g. by the main menu ping) and the pausing of the process, when no client connects inbetween (read as timeout knocked)
* `AUTOPAUSE_PERIOD`, default `10` (seconds)
describes period of the daemonized state machine, that handles the pausing of the process (resuming is done independently)

## Deployment Templates and Examples

### Helm Charts

- [stable/minecraft](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/stable/minecraft) ([chart source](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/minecraft))
- [mcsh/server-deployment](https://github.com/mcserverhosting-net/charts)

### Examples

The [examples directory](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/tree/master/examples) also provides examples of deploying the [itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server/) Docker image.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS) Deployment

If you're looking for a simple way to deploy this to the Amazon Web Services Cloud, check out the [Minecraft Server Deployment (CloudFormation) repository](https://github.com/vatertime/minecraft-spot-pricing). This repository contains a CloudFormation template that will get you up and running in AWS in a matter of minutes. Optionally it uses Spot Pricing so the server is very cheap, and you can easily turn it off when not in use.

## Running a Forge Server

Enable Forge server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=FORGE` to your command-line.
By default the container will run the `RECOMMENDED` version of [Forge server](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/)
but you can also choose to run a specific version with `-e FORGEVERSION=10.13.4.1448`.

    $ docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=FORGE -e FORGEVERSION=10.13.4.1448 \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

To use a pre-downloaded Forge installer, place it in the attached `/data` directory and
specify the name of the installer file with `FORGE_INSTALLER`, such as:

    $ docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e FORGE_INSTALLER=forge-1.11.2-13.20.0.2228-installer.jar ...

To download a Forge installer from a custom location, such as your own file repository, specify
the URL with `FORGE_INSTALLER_URL`, such as:

    $ docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e FORGE_INSTALLER_URL=http://HOST/forge-1.11.2-13.20.0.2228-installer.jar ...

In both of the cases above, there is no need for the `VERSION` or `FORGEVERSION` variables.

In order to add mods, you have two options.

### Using the /data volume

This is the easiest way if you are using a persistent `/data` mount.

To do this, you will need to attach the container's `/data` directory
(see ""Attaching data directory to host filesystem”).
Then, you can add mods to the `/path/on/host/mods` folder you chose. From the example above,
the `/path/on/host` folder contents look like:

```
/path/on/host
├── mods
│   └── ... INSTALL MODS HERE ...
├── config
│   └── ... CONFIGURE MODS HERE ...
├── ops.json
├── server.properties
├── whitelist.json
├── worlds
│   └── ... PLACE MAPS IN THEIR OWN FOLDERS HERE ...
└── ...
```

Providing a presistent `/data` mount is a good idea, both to persist the game world and to allow for the manual configuration which is sometimes needed.

For instance, imagine a scenario when the initial launch has completed, but you now want to change the worldmap for your server.  

Assuming you have a shared directory to your container, you can then (after first launch) drag and drop your premade maps or worlds into the `\worlds\` directory.  **Note:** each world should be placed in its own folder under the `\worlds\` directory.  

Once your maps are in the proper path, you can then specify which map the server uses by changing the `level-name` value in `server.properties` to match the name of your map.

If you add mods or make changes to `server.properties` while the container is running, you'll need to restart it to pick those
up:

    docker stop mc
    docker start mc

### Using separate mounts

This is the easiest way if you are using an ephemeral `/data` filesystem,
or downloading a world with the `WORLD` option.

There are two additional volumes that can be mounted; `/mods` and `/config`.
Any files in either of these filesystems will be copied over to the main
`/data` filesystem before starting Minecraft. If you want old mods to be removed as the `/mods` content is updated, then add `-e REMOVE_OLD_MODS=TRUE`.

This works well if you want to have a common set of modules in a separate
location, but still have multiple worlds with different server requirements
in either persistent volumes or a downloadable archive.



### Replacing variables inside configs

Sometimes you have mods or plugins that require configuration information that is only available at runtime.
For example if you need to configure a plugin to connect to a database,
you don't want to include this information in your Git repository or Docker image.
Or maybe you have some runtime information like the server name that needs to be set
in your config files after the container starts.

For those cases there is the option to replace defined variables inside your configs
with environment variables defined at container runtime.

If you set the enviroment variable `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES` to `TRUE` the startup script
will go thru all files inside your `/data` volume and replace variables that match your
defined environment variables. Variables that you want to replace need to be wrapped
inside `${YOUR_VARIABLE}` curly brackets and prefixed with a dollar sign. This is the regular
syntax for enviromment variables inside strings or config files.

Optionally you can also define a prefix to only match predefined environment variables.

`ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX=""CFG_""` <-- this is the default prefix

If you want use file for value (like when use secrets) you can add suffix `_FILE` to your variable name (in  run command).

There are some limitations to what characters you can use.

| Type  | Allowed Characters  |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| Name  | `0-9a-zA-Z_-`       |
| Value | `0-9a-zA-Z_-:/=?.+` |

Variables will be replaced in files with the following extensions:
`.yml`, `.yaml`, `.txt`, `.cfg`, `.conf`, `.properties`.

Specific files can be excluded by listing their name (without path) in the variable `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDES`.

Paths can be excluded by listing them in the variable `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDE_PATHS`. Path
excludes are recursive. Here is an example:
```
REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDE_PATHS=""/data/plugins/Essentials/userdata /data/plugins/MyPlugin""
```

Here is a full example where we want to replace values inside a `database.yml`.

```yml

---
database:
  host: ${CFG_DB_HOST}
  name: ${CFG_DB_NAME}
  password: ${CFG_DB_PASSWORD}
```

This is how your `docker-compose.yml` file could look like:

```yml
version: ""3""
# Other docker-compose examples in /examples

services:
  minecraft:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    ports:
      - ""25565:25565""
    volumes:
      - ""mc:/data""
    environment:
      EULA: ""TRUE""
      ENABLE_RCON: ""true""
      RCON_PASSWORD: ""testing""
      RCON_PORT: 28016
      # enable env variable replacement
      REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES: ""TRUE""
      # define an optional prefix for your env variables you want to replace
      ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX: ""CFG_""
      # and here are the actual variables
      CFG_DB_HOST: ""http://localhost:3306""
      CFG_DB_NAME: ""minecraft""
      CFG_DB_PASSWORD_FILE: ""/run/secrets/db_password""
    restart: always
  rcon:
    image: itzg/rcon
    ports:
      - ""4326:4326""
      - ""4327:4327""
    volumes:
      - ""rcon:/opt/rcon-web-admin/db""

volumes:
  mc:
  rcon:

secrets:
  db_password:
    file: ./db_password
```

The content of `db_password`:

    ug23u3bg39o-ogADSs
    
## Running a Bukkit/Spigot server

Enable Bukkit/Spigot server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=BUKKIT` or `-e TYPE=SPIGOT` to your command-line.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=SPIGOT \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If you are hosting your own copy of Bukkit/Spigot you can override the download URLs with:

- -e BUKKIT_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>
- -e SPIGOT_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>

You can build spigot from source by adding `-e BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=true`

If you have attached a host directory to the `/data` volume, then you can install plugins within the `plugins` subdirectory. You can also [attach a `/plugins` volume](#deploying-plugins-from-attached-volume). If you add plugins while the container is running, you'll need to restart it to pick those up.

## Running a Paper server

Enable Paper server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=PAPER` to your command-line.

By default the container will run the latest build of [Paper server](https://papermc.io/downloads)
but you can also choose to run a specific build with `-e PAPERBUILD=205`.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=PAPER \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If you are hosting your own copy of Paper you can override the download URL with:

- -e PAPER_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>

An example compose file is provided at
[examples/docker-compose-paper.yml](examples/docker-compose-paper.yml).

If you have attached a host directory to the `/data` volume, then you can install plugins via the `plugins` subdirectory. You can also [attach a `/plugins` volume](#deploying-plugins-from-attached-volume). If you add plugins while the container is running, you'll need to restart it to pick those up.

## Running a Tuinity server

A [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity) server, which is a fork of Paper aimed at improving server performance at high playercounts.

    -e TYPE=TUINITY

> **NOTE** only `VERSION=LATEST` is supported

## Running a Magma server

A [Magma](https://magmafoundation.org/) server, which is a combination of Forge and PaperMC, can be used with

    -e TYPE=MAGMA

> **NOTE** there are limited base versions supported, so you will also need to  set `VERSION`, such as ""1.12.2""


## Running a Mohist server

A [Mohist](https://github.com/Mohist-Community/Mohist) server can be used with

    -e TYPE=MOHIST

> **NOTE** there are limited base versions supported, so you will also need to  set `VERSION`, such as ""1.12.2""


## Running a Catserver type server

A [Catserver](http://catserver.moe/) type server can be used with

    -e TYPE=CATSERVER

> **NOTE** Catserver only provides a single release stream, so `VERSION` is ignored

## Running a server with a Feed the Beast modpack

> **NOTE** requires `itzg/minecraft-server:multiarch` image

[Feed the Beast application](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/) modpacks are supported by using `-e TYPE=FTBA` (**note** the ""A"" at the end of the type). This server type will automatically take care of downloading and installing the modpack and appropriate version of Forge, so the `VERSION` does not need to be specified.

### Environment Variables:
- `FTB_MODPACK_ID`: **required**, the numerical ID of the modpack to install. The ID can be located by [finding the modpack](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpack) and using the ""ID"" displayed next to the name
- `FTB_MODPACK_VERSION_ID`: optional, the numerical Id of the version to install. If not specified, the latest version will be installed. The ""Version ID"" can be obtained by drilling into the Versions tab and clicking a specific version.

### Upgrading

If a specific `FTB_MODPACK_VERSION_ID` was not specified, simply restart the container to pick up the newest modpack version. If using a specific version ID, recreate the container with the new version ID.

### Example

The following example runs the latest version of [FTB Presents Direwolf20 1.12](https://ftb.neptunepowered.org/pack/ftb-presents-direwolf20-1-12/):

```
docker run -d --name mc-ftb -e EULA=TRUE \
  -e TYPE=FTBA -e FTB_MODPACK_ID=31 \
  -p 25565:25565 \
  itzg/minecraft-server:multiarch
```

> Normally you will also add `-v` volume for `/data` since the mods and config are installed there along with world data.

## Running a server with a CurseForge modpack

Enable this server mode by adding `-e TYPE=CURSEFORGE` to your command-line,
but note the following additional steps needed...

You need to specify a modpack to run, using the `CF_SERVER_MOD` environment
variable. A CurseForge server modpack is available together with its respective
client modpack at <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks> .

Now you can add a `-e CF_SERVER_MOD=name_of_modpack.zip` to your command-line.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -e TYPE=CURSEFORGE \
        -e CF_SERVER_MOD=SkyFactory_4_Server_4.1.0.zip \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If you want to keep the pre-download modpacks separate from your data directory,
then you can attach another volume at a path of your choosing and reference that.
The following example uses `/modpacks` as the container path as the pre-download area:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -v /path/to/modpacks:/modpacks \
        -e TYPE=CURSEFORGE \
        -e CF_SERVER_MOD=/modpacks/SkyFactory_4_Server_4.1.0.zip \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

#### Buggy start scripts

Some modpacks have buggy or overly complex start scripts. You can avoid using the bundled start script and use this image's standard server-starting logic by adding `-e USE_MODPACK_START_SCRIPT=false`.

### Fixing ""unable to launch forgemodloader""

If your server's modpack fails to load with an error [like this](https://support.feed-the-beast.com/t/cant-start-crashlanding-server-unable-to-launch-forgemodloader/6028/2):

    unable to launch forgemodloader

then you apply a workaround by adding this to the run invocation:

    -e FTB_LEGACYJAVAFIXER=true

## Running a SpongeVanilla server

Enable SpongeVanilla server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA` to your command-line.
By default the container will run the latest `STABLE` version.
If you want to run a specific version, you can add `-e SPONGEVERSION=1.11.2-6.1.0-BETA-19` to your command-line.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

You can also choose to use the `EXPERIMENTAL` branch.
Just change it with `SPONGEBRANCH`, such as:

    $ docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA -e SPONGEBRANCH=EXPERIMENTAL ...

## Running a Fabric Server

Enable [Fabric server](http://fabricmc.net/use/) mode by adding a `-e TYPE=FABRIC` to your command-line. By default, the container will run the latest version, but you can also choose to run a specific version with `VERSION`.

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
    -e TYPE=FABRIC \
    -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server
```

A specific installer version can be requested using `FABRIC_INSTALLER_VERSION`. 

To use a pre-downloaded Fabric installer, place it in a directory attached into the container, such as the `/data` volume and specify the name of the installer file with `FABRIC_INSTALLER`, such as:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
    -e FABRIC_INSTALLER=fabric-installer-0.5.0.32.jar ...
```

To download a Fabric installer from a custom location, such as your own file repository, specify the URL with `FABRIC_INSTALLER_URL`, such as:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
    -e FABRIC_INSTALLER_URL=http://HOST/fabric-installer-0.5.0.32.jar ...
```

In order to add mods, you have two options:

### Using the /data volume

This is the easiest way if you are using a persistent `/data` mount.

To do this, you will need to attach the container's `/data` directory
(see ""Attaching data directory to host filesystem”).
Then, you can add mods to the `/path/on/host/mods` folder you chose. From the example above,
the `/path/on/host` folder contents look like:

```
/path/on/host
├── mods
│   └── ... INSTALL MODS HERE ...
├── config
│   └── ... CONFIGURE MODS HERE ...
├── ops.json
├── server.properties
├── whitelist.json
└── ...
```

If you add mods while the container is running, you'll need to restart it to pick those
up:

    docker stop mc
    docker start mc

### Using separate mounts

This is the easiest way if you are using an ephemeral `/data` filesystem,
or downloading a world with the `WORLD` option.

There are two additional volumes that can be mounted; `/mods` and `/config`.
Any files in either of these filesystems will be copied over to the main
`/data` filesystem before starting Minecraft.

This works well if you want to have a common set of modules in a separate
location, but still have multiple worlds with different server requirements
in either persistent volumes or a downloadable archive.

## Deploying plugins from attached volume

There is one additional volume that can be mounted; `/plugins`. Any files in this filesystem will be copied over to the main `/data/plugins` filesystem before starting Minecraft. Set `PLUGINS_SYNC_UPDATE=false` if you want files from `/plugins` to take precedence over newer files in `/data/plugins`.

This works well if you want to have a common set of plugins in a separate location, but still have multiple worlds with different server requirements in either persistent volumes or a downloadable archive.

## Running with a custom server JAR

If you would like to run a custom server JAR, set `-e TYPE=CUSTOM` and pass the custom server
JAR via `CUSTOM_SERVER`. It can either be a URL or a container path to an existing JAR file.

If it is a URL, it will only be downloaded into the `/data` directory if it wasn't already. As
such, if you need to upgrade or re-download the JAR, then you will need to stop the container,
remove the file from the container's `/data` directory, and start again.

## Force re-download of the server file

For VANILLA, FORGE, BUKKIT, SPIGOT, PAPER, CURSEFORGE, SPONGEVANILLA server types, set
`$FORCE_REDOWNLOAD` to some value (e.g. 'true) to force a re-download of the server file for
the particular server type. by adding a `-e FORCE_REDOWNLOAD=true` to your command-line.

For example, with PaperSpigot, it would look something like this:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
    -e TYPE=PAPER -e FORCE_REDOWNLOAD=true \
    -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server
```

## Using Docker Compose

Rather than type the server options below, the port mappings above, etc
every time you want to create new Minecraft server, you can now use
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Start with a
`docker-compose.yml` file like the following:

```
minecraft-server:
  ports:
    - ""25565:25565""

  environment:
    EULA: ""TRUE""

  image: itzg/minecraft-server

  container_name: mc

  tty: true
  stdin_open: true
  restart: always
```

and in the same directory as that file run

    docker-compose up -d

Now, go play...or adjust the `environment` section to configure
this server instance.

## Server configuration

By default the server configuration will be created and set based on the following
environment variables, but only the first time the server is started. If the
`server.properties` file already exists, the values in them will not be changed.

If you would like to override the server configuration each time the container
starts up, you can set the OVERRIDE_SERVER_PROPERTIES environment variable like:

    docker run -d -e OVERRIDE_SERVER_PROPERTIES=true ...

This will reset any manual configuration of the `server.properties` file, so if
you want to make any persistent configuration changes you will need to make sure
you have properly set the proper environment variables in your docker run command (described below).

### Server name

The server name (e.g. for bungeecord) can be set like:

    docker run -d -e SERVER_NAME=MyServer ...

### Server port

> **WARNING:** only change this value if you know what you're doing. It is only needed when using host networking and it is rare that host networking should be used. Use `-p` port mappings instead.

If you must, the server port can be set like:

    docker run -d -e SERVER_PORT=25566 ...

**however**, be sure to change your port mapping accordingly and be prepared for some features to break.

### Difficulty

The difficulty level (default: `easy`) can be set like:

    docker run -d -e DIFFICULTY=hard ...

Valid values are: `peaceful`, `easy`, `normal`, and `hard`, and an
error message will be output in the logs if it's not one of these
values.

### Whitelist Players

To whitelist players for your Minecraft server, pass the Minecraft usernames separated by commas via the `WHITELIST` environment variable, such as

    docker run -d -e WHITELIST=user1,user2 ...

If the `WHITELIST` environment variable is not used, any user can join your Minecraft server if it's publicly accessible.

### Op/Administrator Players

To add more ""op"" (aka adminstrator) users to your Minecraft server, pass the Minecraft usernames separated by commas via the `OPS` environment variable, such as

    docker run -d -e OPS=user1,user2 ...

### Server icon

A server icon can be configured using the `ICON` variable. The image will be automatically
downloaded, scaled, and converted from any other image format:

    docker run -d -e ICON=http://..../some/image.png ...

### Rcon

To use rcon use the `ENABLE_RCON` and `RCON_PASSORD` variables.
By default rcon port will be `25575` but can easily be changed with the `RCON_PORT` variable.

    docker run -d -e ENABLE_RCON=true -e RCON_PASSWORD=testing

### Query

Enabling this will enable the gamespy query protocol.
By default the query port will be `25565` (UDP) but can easily be changed with the `QUERY_PORT` variable.

    docker run -d -e ENABLE_QUERY=true

### Max players

By default max players is 20, you can increase this with the `MAX_PLAYERS` variable.

    docker run -d -e MAX_PLAYERS=50

### Max world size

This sets the maximum possible size in blocks, expressed as a radius, that the world border can obtain.

    docker run -d -e MAX_WORLD_SIZE=10000

### Allow Nether

Allows players to travel to the Nether.

    docker run -d -e ALLOW_NETHER=true

### Announce Player Achievements

Allows server to announce when a player gets an achievement.

    docker run -d -e ANNOUNCE_PLAYER_ACHIEVEMENTS=true

### Enable Command Block

Enables command blocks

     docker run -d -e ENABLE_COMMAND_BLOCK=true

### Force Gamemode

Force players to join in the default game mode.

- false - Players will join in the gamemode they left in.
- true - Players will always join in the default gamemode.

  `docker run -d -e FORCE_GAMEMODE=false`

### Generate Structures

Defines whether structures (such as villages) will be generated.

- false - Structures will not be generated in new chunks.
- true - Structures will be generated in new chunks.

  `docker run -d -e GENERATE_STRUCTURES=true`

### Hardcore

If set to true, players will be set to spectator mode if they die.

    docker run -d -e HARDCORE=false

### Snooper

If set to false, the server will not send data to snoop.minecraft.net server.

    docker run -d -e SNOOPER_ENABLED=false

### Max Build Height

The maximum height in which building is allowed.
Terrain may still naturally generate above a low height limit.

    docker run -d -e MAX_BUILD_HEIGHT=256

### Max Tick Time

The maximum number of milliseconds a single tick may take before the server watchdog stops the server with the message, A single server tick took 60.00 seconds (should be max 0.05); Considering it to be crashed, server will forcibly shutdown. Once this criteria is met, it calls System.exit(1).
Setting this to -1 will disable watchdog entirely

    docker run -d -e MAX_TICK_TIME=60000

### Spawn Animals

Determines if animals will be able to spawn.

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_ANIMALS=true

### Spawn Monsters

Determines if monsters will be spawned.

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_MONSTERS=true

### Spawn NPCs

Determines if villagers will be spawned.

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_NPCS=true

### Set spawn protection

Sets the area that non-ops can not edit (0 to disable)

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_PROTECTION=0

### View Distance

Sets the amount of world data the server sends the client, measured in chunks in each direction of the player (radius, not diameter).
It determines the server-side viewing distance.

    docker run -d -e VIEW_DISTANCE=10

### Level Seed

If you want to create the Minecraft level with a specific seed, use `SEED`, such as

    docker run -d -e SEED=1785852800490497919 ...

### Game Mode

By default, Minecraft servers are configured to run in Survival mode. You can
change the mode using `MODE` where you can either provide the [standard
numerical values](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Game_mode#Game_modes) or the
shortcut values:

- creative
- survival
- adventure
- spectator (only for Minecraft 1.8 or later)

For example:

    docker run -d -e MODE=creative ...

### Message of the Day

The message of the day, shown below each server entry in the UI, can be changed with the `MOTD` environment variable, such as

    docker run -d -e 'MOTD=My Server' ...

If you leave it off, a default is computed from the server type and version, such as

    A Paper Minecraft Server powered by Docker

when `TYPE` is `PAPER`. That way you can easily differentiate between several servers you may have started.

_The example shows how to specify a server message of the day that contains spaces by putting quotes
around the whole thing._

### PVP Mode

By default, servers are created with player-vs-player (PVP) mode enabled. You can disable this with the `PVP`
environment variable set to `false`, such as

    docker run -d -e PVP=false ...

### Level Type and Generator Settings

By default, a standard world is generated with hills, valleys, water, etc. A different level type can
be configured by setting `LEVEL_TYPE` to an expected type, such as

- DEFAULT
- FLAT
- LARGEBIOMES
- AMPLIFIED
- CUSTOMIZED
- BUFFET

Descriptions are available at the [gamepedia](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties).

When using a level type of `FLAT`, `CUSTOMIZED`, and `BUFFET`, you can further configure the world generator
by passing [custom generator settings](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Superflat).
**Since generator settings usually have ;'s in them, surround the -e value with a single quote, like below.**

For example (just the `-e` bits):

    -e LEVEL_TYPE=flat -e 'GENERATOR_SETTINGS=3;minecraft:bedrock,3*minecraft:stone,52*minecraft:sandstone;2;'

### Custom Server Resource Pack

You can set a link to a custom resource pack and set it's checksum using the `RESOURCE_PACK` and `RESOURCE_PACK_SHA1` options respectively, the default is blank:

    docker run -d -e 'RESOURCE_PACK=http\://link.com/to/pack.zip?\=1' -e 'RESOURCE_PACK_SHA1=d5db29cd03a2ed055086cef9c31c252b4587d6d0'

**NOTE:** `:` and `=` must be escaped using `\`. The checksum plain-text hexadecimal.

### World Save Name

You can either switch between world saves or run multiple containers with different saves by using the `LEVEL` option,
where the default is ""world"":

    docker run -d -e LEVEL=bonus ...

**NOTE:** if running multiple containers be sure to either specify a different `-v` host directory for each
`LEVEL` in use or don't use `-v` and the container's filesystem will keep things encapsulated.

### Downloadable world

Instead of mounting the `/data` volume, you can instead specify the URL of a ZIP file containing an archived world. It will be searched for a file `level.dat` and the containing subdirectory moved to the directory named by `$LEVEL`. This means that most of the archived Minecraft worlds downloadable from the Internet will already be in the correct format.

    docker run -d -e WORLD=http://www.example.com/worlds/MySave.zip ...

**NOTE:** This URL must be accessible from inside the container. Therefore,
you should use an IP address or a globally resolvable FQDN, or else the
name of a linked container.

**NOTE:** If the archive contains more than one `level.dat`, then the one to select can be picked with `WORLD_INDEX`, which defaults to 1.

### Cloning world from a container path

The `WORLD` option can also be used to reference a directory or zip file that will be used as a source to clone or unzip the world directory.

For example, the following would initially clone the world's content
from `/worlds/basic`. Also notice in the example that you can use a
read-only volume attachment to ensure the clone source remains pristine.

```
docker run ... -v $HOME/worlds:/worlds:ro -e WORLD=/worlds/basic
```

### Overwrite world on start
The world will only be downloaded or copied if it doesn't exist already. Set `FORCE_WORLD_COPY=TRUE` to force overwrite the world on every server start.

### Downloadable mod/plugin pack for Forge, Bukkit, and Spigot Servers

Like the `WORLD` option above, you can specify the URL of a ""mod pack""
to download and install into `mods` for Forge or `plugins` for Bukkit/Spigot.
To use this option pass the environment variable `MODPACK`, such as

    docker run -d -e MODPACK=http://www.example.com/mods/modpack.zip ...

**NOTE:** The referenced URL must be a zip file with one or more jar files at the
top level of the zip archive. Make sure the jars are compatible with the
particular `TYPE` of server you are running.

You may also download individual mods using the `MODS` environment variable and supplying the URL
to the jar files. Multiple mods/plugins should be comma separated.

    docker run -d -e MODS=https://www.example.com/mods/mod1.jar,https://www.example.com/mods/mod2.jar ...

### Remove old mods/plugins

When the option above is specified (`MODPACK`) you can also instruct script to
delete old mods/plugins prior to installing new ones. This behaviour is desirable
in case you want to upgrade mods/plugins from downloaded zip file.
To use this option pass the environment variable `REMOVE_OLD_MODS=""TRUE""`, such as

    docker run -d -e REMOVE_OLD_MODS=""TRUE"" -e MODPACK=http://www.example.com/mods/modpack.zip ...

**WARNING:** All content of the `mods` or `plugins` directory will be deleted
before unpacking new content from the MODPACK or MODS.

### Online mode

By default, server checks connecting players against Minecraft's account database. If you want to create an offline server or your server is not connected to the internet, you can disable the server to try connecting to minecraft.net to authenticate players with environment variable `ONLINE_MODE`, like this

    docker run -d -e ONLINE_MODE=FALSE ...

### Allow flight

Allows users to use flight on your server while in Survival mode, if they have a mod that provides flight installed.

    -e ALLOW_FLIGHT=TRUE|FALSE

### Other server property mappings

| Environment Variable              | Server Property                   |

| ENFORCE_WHITELIST                 | enforce-whitelist                 |

## Miscellaneous Options

### Running as alternate user/group ID

By default, the container will switch to user ID 1000 and group ID 1000;
however, you can override those values by setting `UID` and/or `GID` as environmental entries, during the `docker run` command.

    -e UID=1234
    -e GID=1234

The container will also skip user switching if the `--user`/`-u` argument
is passed to `docker run`.

### Memory Limit

By default, the image declares a Java initial and maximum memory limit of 1 GB. There are several
ways to adjust the memory settings:

- `MEMORY`, ""1G"" by default, can be used to adjust both initial (`Xms`) and max (`Xmx`)
  memory settings of the JVM
- `INIT_MEMORY`, independently sets the initial heap size
- `MAX_MEMORY`, independently sets the max heap size

The values of all three are passed directly to the JVM and support format/units as
`<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K]`. For example:

    -e MEMORY=2G

### JVM Options

General JVM options can be passed to the Minecraft Server invocation by passing a `JVM_OPTS`
environment variable. Options like `-X` that need to proceed general JVM options can be passed
via a `JVM_XX_OPTS` environment variable.

For some cases, if e.g. after removing mods, it could be necessary to startup minecraft with an additional `-D` parameter like `-Dfml.queryResult=confirm`. To address this you can use the environment variable `JVM_DD_OPTS`, which builds the params from a given list of values separated by space, but without the `-D` prefix. To make things running under systems (e.g. Plesk), which doesn't allow `=` inside values, a `:` (colon) could be used instead. The upper example would look like this:
`JVM_DD_OPTS=fml.queryResult:confirm`, and will be converted to `-Dfml.queryResult=confirm`.

### Enable Remote JMX for Profiling

To enable remote JMX, such as for profiling with VisualVM or JMC, add the environment variable `ENABLE_JMX=true` and add a port forwarding of TCP port 7091, such as:

    -e ENABLE_JMX=true -p 7091:7091

### Enable Aikar's Flags

[Aikar has does some research](https://mcflags.emc.gs/) into finding the optimal JVM flags for GC tuning, which becomes more important as more users are connected concurrently. The set of flags documented there can be added using

    -e USE_AIKAR_FLAGS=true

When `MEMORY` is greater than or equal to 12G, then the Aikar flags will be adjusted according to the article.

Large page support can also be enabled by adding

    -e USE_LARGE_PAGES=true

### HTTP Proxy

You may configure the use of an HTTP/HTTPS proxy by passing the proxy's URL via the `PROXY`
environment variable. In [the example compose file](examples/docker-compose-proxied.yml) it references
a companion squid proxy by setting the equivalent of

    -e PROXY=proxy:3128

### Using ""noconsole"" option

Some older versions (pre-1.14) of Spigot required `--noconsole` to be passed when detaching stdin, which can be done by setting `-e CONSOLE=FALSE`.

### Explicitly disable GUI

Some older servers get confused and think that the GUI interface is enabled. You can explicitly
disable that by passing `-e GUI=FALSE`.

### Stop Duration

When the container is signalled to stop, the Minecraft process wrapper will attempt to send a ""stop"" command via RCON or console and waits for the process to gracefully finish. By defaul it waits 60 seconds, but that duration can be configured by setting the environment variable `STOP_DURATION` to the number of seconds.

## Running on RaspberryPi

To run this image on a RaspberryPi 3 B+, 4, or newer, use the image tag

    itzg/minecraft-server:multiarch

> NOTE: you may need to lower the memory allocation, such as `-e MEMORY=750m`

Development status
--------
This was an old high school/first year uni project and won't be update much anymore. Of course, if something is desparately broken I (or perhaps you!) may be able to fix that.

However, I have ported the core parts of the program to C# - see the [c-sharp-branch](https://github.com/navhaxs/minecraft-server-dashboard/tree/c-sharp-branch) of this repo if you're interested. The goal of the C# branch is to have better code quality (e.g. MVVM) and support for localisation (translation).

Thanks to all the users and support over the years!

## Why use JSPrismarine?

*   Written in TypeScript which means that it's easy to use and develop plugins for. You can in theory develop plugins in any language that transpile into JavaScript (such as TypeScript, Kotlin, CoffeeScript, asm.js and many more).
*   Open source with the permissive [MPL2](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/blob/master/LICENSE) license.
*   Under active development.

## Getting started

Prebuilt binaries will be provided once a stable release is out, these will not require a node environment. For now however, you can either follow the steps bellow or download the [latest nightly](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+workflow%3A%22Build+artifacts%22) (which may or may not work).

*   Linux/MacOS/Unix based OS or Windows (requires WSL)
    -   You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v14+ and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) v7+.
    -   Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine.git`.
    -   Go in the cloned repository `cd JSPrismarine`
    -   Install dependencies `npm install`.
    -   Before running production build you have to build it `npm run build`
    -   You're done, you can run it using `npm run start` (or `npm run dev` for development)

## FAQ

*   Can I contribute?
    -   Sure, make sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file first.
*   Is JSPrismarine for `Minecraft: Bedrock Edition` or `Minecraft: Java Edition`?
    -   JSPrismarine is made for `Minecraft: Bedrock Edition`, there may however be plugin(s) available to provide a `Minecraft: Java Edition` implementation..
*   What devices devices can a player join JSPrismarine with?
    -   By default PC/Windows, Android, iOS. However with some tricks you can also join with Xbox One, Switch and the PS4.
*   Which OSes can run JSPrismarine?
    -   Any platform supporting Node.js v14 or later.
*   Does it support plugins?
    -   Yes but JSPrismarine is in fast development-mode which means that currently SEMVER isn't strictly followed. We do however try to provide a deprecation warning two weeks ahead of removing an API function.
*   If my question isn't listed here where should I sak?
    -   You can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fGkHZhu), ask on the [forums](https://prismarine.dev) or in case of a development-related question issue an open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/HerryYT/JSPrismarine/issues/new).
*   Why can't I join a JSPrismarine instance hosted on my Windows PC?
    -   To join an instance of JSPrismarine hosted on the same Windows machine you need to enable Loopback by doing the following:
        -   Open Windows PowerShell as administrator
        -   Run this command: `CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n=""Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe""`
        -   Open Minecraft and add a server with the ip `127.0.0.1`

# Mineralogy
## MMD's Minecraft Mineralogy Mod
This mod replaces the generic ""stone"" in Minecraft with real-world rock types.

## Texture Packs
There are three levels of texture resolution available. The default textures are low-resolution (16x16 pixels, same as Minecraft), but I recommend trying the high-resolution (64x64 pixels) textures via the high-res texture pack (available on the Release page).

## Q&A
Q: Why make this mod?
A: Minecraft is a game that involves a lot of mining, yet it takes very little inspiration from actual geology. We made this mod to give Minecraft more of a geology vibe. After all, there's no mineral called ""stone"" in the geology textbook.

Q: Where's the cobblestone?!
A: Many of the stone types can be used as cobblestone or as stone in crafting recipes. If you want ""Stone"", smelt gravel. If you want ""Cobblestone"", craft two blocks of rock with 2 blocks of gravel.

Q: There's too much lag when generating new chunks!
A: Yes, that can happen. Mineralogy puts a lot more computation into world generation, so you don't want to run the server (or play single-player) on a computer with a slow CPU. We tried to improve performance as much as possible, but there's no getting around the fact that the stone type needs to be calculated for every single underground block in the game.

Q: Why do the ores look funny?
A: We re-textured the ores to better match the appearance of the new rock types. You can change them back by making your own texture pack from the default Minecraft resources.

## Notes to Other Modders
This mod replaces the WorldProvider for the Overworld in Minecraft. There can only be one provider per dimension, so this mod is therefore incompatible with other mods that also replace the same WorldProvider.

The stone types are all registered with the OreDictionary as Stone and/or Cobblestone. If you use OreDictionary crafting recipes (ShapelessOreRecipe or ShapedOreRecipe), then there shouldn't be any trouble. However, if you manually specify the Stone or Cobblestone blocks in a standard crafting recipe object, then users of the Mineralogy mod will have to craft Cobblestone (2 gravel + 2 rock blocks) to use your recipe.

## Using the C Renderer

The C renderer is likely to be faster than the Python renderer. To use the C renderer, it must be compiled first. To complile, run the command: `python3 setup.py build` in the root of the repository. Then run the game as normal and go into settings to switch the renderers.

Please report any bugs in the C renderer, or differences between the Python renderer and the C renderer in issues.

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests or issues for bug reports/fixes or new feature ideas! Help us make the game more fun :D

Block and chest/container inventory tracking tool for fabric that can be configured to use MySQL or SQLite with a fast and responsive web UI.
[Join the DeltaLogger discord](https://discord.gg/UxHnDWr)

## Archival

Support for DeltaLogger will be dropped in 1.17 and above. Please see the discord for the replacement

## Setup

DeltaLogger supports two types of database: MySQL and SQLite
Place the mod jar in the mods folder of your server directory and launch your fabric server once to make it generate a `config/deltalogger.properties`, or make a file called `deltalogger.properties` in the `config` folder of your server directory. Put the following as the file content:

```properties
# DeltaLogger configuration

# Whether you want to use an SQLite database. Put false for MySQL.
use_sqlite=true

# Port to use for the web app. Navigate to http://serverhostname:port to see web app
webapp_port=

# Server domain url or hostname. Used for giving links to the web app
webapp_host=

##! MYSQL ONLY BELOW. If you are using SQLite these are safe to ignore. !##

# Name of the MySQL database to use. If you do not have one, then do
# ""CREATE DATABASE yourdbname"" from a MySQL client first.
database=

# MySQL port
port=
# MySQL host/url
host=
# MySQL username
username=
# MySQL password
password=

# MySQL SSL configuration. You can leave this as false but the database
# connection will not be encrypted. If you are using MySQL across the open internet
# then you should strongly consider properly enabling SSL
useSSL=false
requireSSL=false
```
By default, SQLite is enabled. This means that your logs will be saved to a database found in `world/deltalogger.sqlite`. If you want to use MySQL, fill out the additional properties with the relevant information to access your database and set `use_sqlite` to `false`.

This mod also requires the fabric api mod, which you can find [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

## In Game Commands

- `/dl inspect` Whack a block or container to see recent interactions with the target.
- `/dl inspect <pos>` Shows database records for the block position provided.
- `/dl search <filters>` Builds a database query with the parameters specified
- `/dl rollback <radius> <time> [filters]` Runs a rollback with the terms specified
- `/dl resetpass` get a temporary password for the web interface

### Rollback time arguments

You can use any one of the following to specify your times, but you can only use one

`<years>y <days>d <hours>h <minutes>m <seconds>s`

## Support

Support can be obtained on the discord found [here](https://discord.gg/UxHnDWr)

## Download

You can find precompiled builds of DeltaLogger on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deltalogger) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/deltalogger)

## License

Licensed under AGPL with additional linking permission. See LICENSE file.

## Issues

If you find a bug, please open an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/fabricservertools/DeltaLogger/issues). Please ask on the discord if you have a support issue which is not a bug

### Known Issues

We are aware of these issues, so please do not open any issues regarding these as they will be ignored, whether these will be fixed is at our discretion, so please do not beg to have one of these fixed as it is unlikely that we will do so.

#### Dynmap Incompatibility

**Issue:** Deltalogger does not work with Dynmap 3.1-beta7

**Workaround:** Use 3.1-beta6 until the issue is resolved.

#### Bits and Chisels

**Issue:** Bits and Chisels is incompatible with Deltalogger

**Workaround:** Currently none

### Issue resolving

Issues which are not valid will be closed as invalid. We will fix remaining issues once we decide the time is right. Generally, major issues will be fixed first.

## Build

You will need a JDK installed. We suggest AdoptOpenJDK 8, which you can download [from their website](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot). From there, just download the code, open a terminal in the location of the code and run the following command:

Windows:
`gradlew.bat build`

Linux/macOS
`./gradlew build`

The mod jars are then found in `build/libs`. For almost all uses, you want the jar without `-dev` or `-sources` on the end

## Contribute

Feel free to fork and open a pull request with features you add. We do suggest asking on the discord about a feature before spending loads on time on it! Ping `@yitzy` if you want to have access to the development channel

![](https://i.imgur.com/jUOKFUl.gif)

* Adds hunger/saturation/exhaustion info to the debug overlay (F3)
* Syncs the value of saturation and exhaustion to the client.

---

### Building AppleSkin
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a command line and execute ```gradlew build```

Note: To give the build a version number, use ```gradlew build -Pversion=<version>``` instead (example: ```gradlew build -Pversion=1.0.0```).

---

### For Mod Developers

> Note: These instructions are Forge-specific. For Fabric, see the instructions in the relevant `-fabric` branch.

If followed, the directions below will make it so that your mod's Maven dependencies won't include AppleSkin at all, and your mod will load fine with or without AppleSkin installed.

To compile against the AppleSkin API, include the following in your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
	maven { url ""https://maven.ryanliptak.com/"" }
}
```

and add this to your `dependencies` block:

```groovy
compileOnly fg.deobf(""squeek.appleskin:appleskin-forge:<version>:api"")
```

where `<version>` is replaced by the appropriate version found here:

https://maven.ryanliptak.com/squeek/appleskin/appleskin-forge

Once you're compiling against the AppleSkin API, you can create an event handler and only register it when `appleskin` is loaded. Here's an example implementation:

In your `@Mod` annotated class:

```java
private void clientInit(final FMLClientSetupEvent event) {
    if (ModList.get().isLoaded(""appleskin"")) {
        MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.register(new AppleSkinEventHandler());
    }
}
```

and the `AppleSkinEventHandler` class:

```java
public class AppleSkinEventHandler
{
	@SubscribeEvent
	public void onPreTooltipEvent(TooltipOverlayEvent.Pre event) {
		// hide the tooltip for regular apples
		if (event.itemStack.getItem() == Items.APPLE) {
			event.setCanceled(true);
		}
	}
}
```

(see the `squeek.appleskin.api.event` package for all the possible events that can be registered)

---

Note: if you want to test with the full AppleSkin mod in your development environment, you can also add the following to your `dependencies`:

```groovy
runtimeOnly fg.deobf(""squeek.appleskin:appleskin-forge:<version>"")
```

while replacing `<version>` as mentioned above."

736,saada2006/MinecraftShaderProgramming,GLSL,"# Minecraft Shader Programming

This repository contains information and tutorials on how to write custom shaders for Minecraft using the Optifine mod. The tutorials start at the ""Tutorial 0 - Introduction"" folder and then the ""Tutorial N - ABCD"" folders contain information on how to add a certain effect to your shader. The ""Tutorial 0 - Introduction"" folder is not a shader pack, but the other tutorial folders are. For these tutorials the only requirement is a basic knowledge of graphics programming (you need to know everything up to the concept of rendering to a texture), although I plan to add another tutorial that explains all the basics in detail.

I originally created this project because when I was learning how to write Minecraft shaders, there was little to no information I could find on how to write them. These set of tutorials aims to get rid of that issue for those who want to learn how to write a Minecraft shader.

If you want to contribute your own tutorial, create a pull request. One of my end goals with this project is the turn this into a community effort.

## How to download

First make sure you have Optifine installed and find your `shaderpacks` folder.

If you have `git` installed, first move every shader in your `shaderpacks` folder to a temporary directory, so you can clone this repository into your `shaderpacks` folder and move everything back in.

If you do not have `git` installed, download this repo and move it's files into your `shaderpacks` folder.

737,codyphobe/minecraft,PHP,"# Minecraft Class

This class was developed to provide a set of functions to integrate Minecraft within your projects.
Under no circumstances are you permitted to use this for malicious purposes.

#### Example Usage

```php
require 'class.minecraft.php';
if ($minecraft->signin('username', 'password')) {
    foreach($minecraft->account as $field => $value) {
        echo $field . '->' . $value . '<br>';
    }
} else {
    echo $minecraft->getLastError();
}
```

---

#### Login

```php
$minecraft->signin('username', 'password', 'version');
```

This function is used to login to your Minecraft account, taking 3 parameters:
username (or email since Mojang account migration), password and the version of the minecraft launcher (optional)
which is currently **12** by defaults. This returns **true** if the user was successfully authenticated and **false**
otherwise. An array is also set upon successful login which contains the following...

* **current_version**: The current version of the games resources.
* **correct_username**: A correctly formatted username.
* **session_token**: The current session used to login to the Minecraft client.
* **premium_account**: If the account specified is of premium status.
* **player_skin**: The url to the users custom skin, if applicable.
* **request_timestamp**: the timestamp for the request which is formatted as **DDMMYYYYHHMMSS** in local server time.

If the authentication fail, you can use the ```getLastError()``` method to see why.

---

#### Is Premium

```php
$minecraft->isPremium('username');
```

This function determines if the user specified has a premium account or not.
It takes a single parameter of **username** (optional if already used successfully the signin method)
and returns **true** if a premium account was detected and **false** otherwise.

---

#### Get Skin Url

```php
$minecraft->getSkinUrl('username');
```

This function firstly checks the user specified has a premium account,
then returns an url to the skin file for that user if a custom skin was found.
It takes a single parameter which is the **username** of the user you which to
get the skin file of (optional if already used successfully the signin method).

---

#### Keep Alive

```php
$minecraft->keepAlive('session', 'username');
```

This function is used to keep the user's current session alive,
this command needs to be sent to the Minecraft servers every 600
ticks (60 seconds) otherwise the user is signed out. It takes 2 parameters,
the **username** and **session** returned from signing into the account
(optionals if already used successfully the signin method),
this can be obtained with the code above...

---

#### Account

```php
$minecraft->account['session_token'];
```

This variable is **false** if you didn't sign in correctly.

---

#### Render Skin

```php
$minecraft->renderSkin($render_type, $size, $username);
```

This function renders the specified player's skin. It takes 3 parameters, the first being the **username** of the player who's skin you wish to render,
the **render_type** which can either be **head** OR **body** and the **size**
you would like the rendered image to be.
Please note when rendering the full body, the image width is half the size of the image height.
You can include this function directly inside a **img** tag by using the following
example...

```html
<img src=""data:image/png;base64,<?= base64_encode($minecraft->renderSkin('head', 64, 'nblackburn')) ?>"">
```

If you want to call a php script which generate rendered skin, you can also use it like that :

```php
<?php

require 'class.minecraft.php';

header('Content-Type: image/png');
$mc = new Minecraft();
// parameters can be passed by GET e.g.
echo $mc->renderSkin('head', 64, 'nblackburn');
```

So in your html file, you can just like it like an ordinary image.

```html
<img src=""path/to/your/script.php"">
```

---

#### Get Username

```php
$minecraft->getUsername();
```

This function return the username of the last successfully signed in user.

If no user has been successfully signed in, this function will throw an **exception**.

# Minecraft 文言文資源包

![logo](https://mcwiki-1301161188.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/github/minecraft-lzh/logo1.png)

## 作用

這個資源包為Minecraft新增了一個語言：文言文。

## 使用

請在[release頁面](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/minecraft-lzh/releases)選擇版本下載，像其他資源包一樣復制到你對應的 `.minecraft/resourcepacks/` 目錄中（[MCBBS上的教程](https://www.mcbbs.net/thread-880869-1-1.html)）（MultiMC、HMCL或其他分離版本的啟動器請自行查找）。資源包新建了一個語言，安裝啟用後在語言設置中選擇“**文言（華夏）**”即可體驗。

### 版本差異

* 無後綴：未翻譯的部分使用英文。
* `_compatible` ：兼容版本（避免 Mod 漢化失效）。未翻譯的部分使用繁體中文。
* `_leaveblank` ：留空版本。未翻譯的部分留空。
* `_legacy` ：舊版本。用於1.12.2及以下。

請根據需求選擇下載。在目前仍處於早期階段的情況下，我們推薦您使用兼容版本。

### 自行打包

我們提供了一個自動構建腳本（正式打包也使用）。

請確保您已安裝Python 3.6+和Git。如果沒有，請前往[Python官網](https://www.python.org)和[Git官網](https://www.git-scm.com)下載。

1. 下載源碼：

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/minecraft-lzh.git
```

2. 進入文件夾：

``` bash
cd minecraft-lzh
```

3. 運行Python命令：

``` bash
python preset_build.py
```

在 `builds` 文件夾中會出現 `lzh.zip` 、 `lzh_compatible.zip` 、 `lzh_leaveblank.zip` 和 `lzh_legacy.zip` 四個資源包，名稱和作用如上所述。

如果只需要常規的資源包，運行：

``` bash
python build.py normal
```

如果只需要加載兼容版本的資源包，運行：

``` bash
python build.py compat
```

更詳細的用法請運行：

``` bash
python build.py -h
```

740,lucko/minecraft-command-permissions-fabric,Java,"# Minecraft Command Permissions Fabric

A mod to add permission checks for built-in Minecraft commands.

* Download from the [releases](https://github.com/lucko/minecraft-command-permissions-fabric/releases) tab.
* You also need to have a permissions mod installed. (e.g. [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net))

## Details

Permissions for built-in Minecraft commands are added in the format `minecraft.command.<command>`.   
(e.g. `minecraft.command.ban` for the /ban command)

The permission checks are performed using [fabric-permissions-api](https://github.com/lucko/fabric-permissions-api), which acts as an interface between permission *checking* mods (like this one) and permission *provider* mods.

If you're using LuckPerms, you can grant these permissions using the permission set command.   
e.g. `/lp group admin permission set minecraft.command.ban true`

Any permission provider mod that supports fabric-permissions-api is also supported.

ChestShop is an awesome plugin for managing your server's economy. 
By using chests and signs, you can effectively create your own market!

ChestShop also makes admininstators' lives easier. 
Simply drag-and-drop the .jar to your ""plugins"" folder and you're done! 

If you need any help - just ask. There is a ticket system, in which you can report bugs, suggest improvements and more.
Don't be fooled though - you might think that your ticket disappeared, however that's not the case.   
You should configure the system to show **""All tickets""**, instead of only **""All open""** - you can do that by clicking on the ""Filters"".


Building
--------------------------------

#### Installing

To build ChestShop, you'll need a Maven installation.
* [Maven download](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* Launch `mvn clean install` -- that's it!

#### Installing external dependencies

To install external dependencies, place your .jar into the main folder and launch the `install_dependency_to_repo.sh` script - it'll guide you through the process.

<h1 align=""center"">ambrosial</h1>

Ambrosial is a launcher for Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition modifications.

## Features
- [x] Server stored modifications
- `Ensures you are always up to date by retrieving the latest modifications from the server.`
- [x] Fast & reliable
- `Ambrosial requires very little power & network usage, downloads and injections are almost instant.`
- [x] Download caching
- `Any download made is stored for next usage, minimizing bandwidth and allowing for offline use.`
- [x] Safe & open source
- `Ambrosial is trusted by thousands of users and has the source code available for download.`
- [x] Ease of use
- `Download and launch new modifications in a single click, no extra work needed.`
- [x] Large range of modifications
- `Ambrosial has a wide collection of modifications, your favourites & more will be included.`

## Download & installation
Ambrosial is portable and very easy to install. Simply [click here](https://github.com/disepi/ambrosial/releases) and download the **latest** `Ambrosial.exe` listed at the top. Once you have downloaded the executable, open it and installation is done. Don't get confused with the source code download - you will not need to download it if you do not wish to modify it.

## Troubleshooting
If you have any problem running Ambrosial or any included modification, try these listed fixes:
#### Installing Visual C++ Redistributable
- Some included modifications requires this redist to operate. If you do not already have it installed, it can be found [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
#### Installing .NET Framework Redistributable
- Ambrosial requires .NET Framework in order to open. The download for it can be found [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net472-web-installer).

`If you require any other help, please open an issue.`

## Building from source
### Building the executable
- Ambrosial runs on .NET Framework 4.7.2, you will need to install the SDK for it before proceeding. Visual Studio 2022/2019 can be used for building Ambrosial.
- Once opened in Visual Studio, you will need to install multiple NuGET packages using the manager. The list of required packages are as listed:

  - [x] DiscordRichPresence
  - [x] Costura.Fody
  - [x] Newtonsoft.JSON
  - [x] Guna.UI2.WinForms
- Use the Build Solution option in Visual Studio to compile the executable. It is advised to compile on Release mode.

### Creating client collection for serialization/deserialization
- The developer form has tools to obtain the current encrypted collection string, decrypt string to obtain the raw JSON and encrypt string to encrypt raw JSON. If you know what you are doing, it is simple to edit the collection string. If you wish to change the web endpoint which it collects the string from, look at the `requestEnd` string property in `setupClients()` located inside the `.\Ambrosial\AmbrosialC.cs` file.

Check the wiki on github for details.<br/>
Please leave feedback!<br/><br/>

<span style=""font-size: 20px;color:red"">
    I do not allow anybody to publish compiled source (.jar) on their websites.<br/>
    Please download NovaGuilds' binary files only from bukkit.org, github and novaguilds.pl<br/>
    The safest way is to compile it yourself!<br/>
    You are free to redistribute modified versions of source code to others, but you must not distribute compiled versions of the plugin using the name NovaGuilds.

<h2><b>How to compile NovaGuilds on your own?</b></h2>
First of all, you'll need to download the source. Download the zip from github and unpack, or (and this is a better idea)
Then you need Maven to build the project. Download it from public repositories (your machine probably runs Linux).
'cd' into plugin's directory and build it.
My project uses CraftBukkit <i>1.7.10-R0.1</i> Please build it on your own, because redistributing is against its license. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarcinWieczorek/NovaGuilds.git
cd NovaGuilds/
mvn clean install
```

McEx is a Minecraft server written in Elixir and Rust. All the networking and logic is implemented in Elixir, while the low level chunk data handling is done in Rust.

It is written with distribution in mind. It will take advantage of all cores on the machine by default. In the future it should be possible to offload the computationally heavy parts (like chunk generation, chunk servers, even anticheat) to other machines, while keeping the core parts that require more swift communication on a single machine.

##### Features:
* Joining (compression, encryption, packet handling)
* Player movement
* World (chunk loading, world generation)
* World interaction (only block destruction for now)

##### Built on:
* [Rustler](https://github.com/hansihe/Rustler) - For making interaction between the Elixir and Rust code easy.
* [voxel_worldgen](https://github.com/hansihe/voxel_worldgen) - World generation.
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Safe systems-level programming language. Chunk code is written in rust.
* [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) - Ruby-like language on top of Erlang/OTP. Networking, logic, etc is written in Elixir.
* [Erlang/OTP](https://www.erlang.org/) - The platform it all runs on.

##### Installation:
```sh
# install elixir and other dependencies

## Installation
You can [download](https://github.com/Jystro/Minecraft-info-bot/archive/master.zip) the bot files locally and host it on your own or [add the official one](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=728958101499150397&permissions=125952&scope=bot)
### Git and Node
These steps are the same for both git and downloading a .zip archive
1. Download the repository using git with `git clone https://github.com/Jystro/Minecraft-info-bot` or by [downloading a zip file](https://github.com/Jystro/Minecraft-info-bot/archive/master.zip) and unzipping it
2. Open a terminal in the directory of the package.json file
3. Run the command `bash node.sh`. The code will now create two files
4. You can set the env variable DISCORD_TOKEN to your token or write it after the = character in the `.env` file. You can get a token [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
5. Run `bash node.sh` again
### Docker
If you have Docker installed on your machine, another option is to use a Dockerfile

There are two available options for Dockerfiles, the first being `Dockerfile.lightweight` and the second one `Dockerfile.standalone`. To install either of them, remove the extention and set the DISCORD_TOKEN environmental variable. Dockerfile.standalone requires an additional BOT_VERSION variable

* Dockerfile.lightweight: lighter, requires the repository to be locally installed. Approximate size: 65.38 MB
* Dockerfile.standalone: doesn't require any additional file. Approximate size: 79 MB

To create a lightweight container called ""minecraft-info-bot"", edit `Dockerfile.lightweight` and add your token after the `DISCORD_TOKEN` variable. Execute `docker.sh` using bash and wait for the container to be up and running

**Important**: Data will **not** be persisted if you don't use a volume or a bind mount, check docker.sh for an example of bind mount

If you need help with the bot, join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sBMGYXh)

752,lucaazalim/minecraft-server-ping,Java,"MCServerPing
===================

MCServerPing is a quick and easy Java API for grabbing Minecraft server information. It allows you to access information sent to the client to display on the server list. Currently, information available is:

 * String and Text Component based MOTD 
 * Favicon
 * Server and protocol versions
 * Player counts and samples
 
Some additional features:

 * Provides a simple built-in SRV resolver
 * Allows you to retrieve Text Component based MOTD
 * Much more

Please leave the copyright notice intact in source if you copy source into your code rather than build path.

If you require compatibility with the previous packets, use the [alpha tag](https://github.com/jamietech/MinecraftServerPing/releases/tag/alpha).

The latest version of MCServerPing is based heavily upon the work of [zh32](https://gist.github.com/zh32/7190955).

## Configuration
Configuration is provided through the `MinecraftPingOptions` class. This class provides the following configuration options:

 * `String` hostname *(hostname of the server to query, **required**)*
 * `int` port *(port of the server to query, **optional** default `25565`)*
 * `int` timeout *(socket timeout in ms, **optional** default `2000`)*
 * `String` charset *(charset for MOTD byte->string, **optional** default `UTF-8`)*
 * `int` protocolVersion *(protocol version to ping the server with, **optional** default `4`)*

## Example

MinecraftServerPing is very easy to use and implement into any project. Simply clone the repo, compile the code and add it to your build path. Coding with it is as simple as this too:

```java

MCPingOptions options = MCPingOptions.builder()
  .hostname(""example.com"")
  .port(25565)
  .build();

MCPingResponse data = MCPing.getPing(options);      
System.out.println(data.getDescription().getStrippedText() + ""  --  "" + data.getPlayers().getOnline() + ""/"" + data.getPlayers().getMax());

```

An example class is available [here](https://github.com/lucaazalim/MCServerPing/blob/master/src/main/java/br/com/azalim/mcserverping/examples/MCPingExample.java).

## FAQ
__Q__: Response attribute `hostname`  returns the server motd on full_stat.

__A__: Correct. That is according to the definition in https://wiki.vg/Query#Full_stat .
The response from the server uses the keyword `hostname` for the MOTD data.
```javascript
{ type: 0,
  sessionId: 1,
  hostname: 'A Vanilla Minecraft Server powered by Docker',
  gametype: 'SMP',
  game_id: 'MINECRAFT',
  version: '1.15.2',

755,FoxInFlame/MinecraftColorCodes,JavaScript,"# MinecraftColorCodes
Minecraft has it's own Color Code system, in which they use § characters.
This JS library I made will translate all color codes into HTML, so you can insert it in your website.

##Installation
Download this as a zip, and open the zip.
Place MinecraftColorCodes.js in the directory you want.
In the webpage you have the string want to translate, link the JS file in your ``` head ``` tag.
Like so:
```
<head>
<script src=""MinecraftColorCodes.js""></script>
</head>
```
You can also link the JS file at the bottom of the webpage, right before the ```body``` tag. 

Now you can use it!

##Usage
Example:
```
<script>
var yourMOTD = ""§d§lnerd.nu§8: §6§oCreative Rev 28"";
var newMOTD = yourMOTD.replaceColorCodes();
console.log(newMOTD);
<script>
```
Simple enough. Get your string, attach the function at the end (Don't forget the brackets, they are essential) and voila! You can then do whatever you like with it!


##Extras
You might want to get your server's MOTD, but you don't know how to access the server from your website?
Use this code! (jQuery needed)
```
$(document).ready(function(){
  $.getJSON('https://mcapi.us/server/status?ip=c.nerd.nu', function(obj){
    if(obj.online === true){
      motdHTML = obj.motd.replaceColorCodes();
      console.log(motdHTML);
    } else {
      console.log(""Server is offline..."");
    }
  });
})
```
https://mcapi.us provides JSON responses from the server provided in the URL. By using this, you can parse the JSON, and get your desired information! Visit http://mcapi.us for more information on the JSON format.


##Bugs / ToDo

- #1 §k does not work. (FIXED IN VERSION 3.0)
- #2 Having multiple formatting codes does not work. (FIXED IN VERSION 2.0)
- #3 The spaces disappear, and the output is a whole big chunk of letters. (FIXED IN VERSION 3.5)
- #4 Color Codes should reset previous occuring formatting codes, yet they seem to keep the formatting. (FIXED IN VERSION 3.7)

If you find one, please submit an issue ticket or a pull request.

- Add Class support (DROPPED!)
- Add Support for custom class, like first match, second match, etc... (DROPPED!)
- Put everything in a huge String.prototype function. (DONE!)
- Fix Bugs (DONE FOR ALL LISTED)

##Updates
v1.0 - Created this file, added replacements for color codes

v1.1 - Added formatting replacements (e.g. §l)

v1.2 - Added support for multiple occurence of one color code in a string

v1.3 - Added support for New Line, and Spaces because spaces were buggy. The ```\n``` character translates into ```<br>```, and the spaces translate into Unicode spaces (```&#32;```).

v2.0 - A complete recode. Now fixed Bug #2, 'Having multiple formatting codes does not work'. New line and spaces was removed.

v3.0 - Added §k, §r, and \n support. Now also requires the output element ID.

v3.1 - Finally! Support for class names too!

v3.5 - Fixed Bug #3, 'Spaces dissappear', by adding a CSS property to the output element.'

v3.7 - Fixed Bug #4, put everything in a huge ```String.prototype``` function, so now you can't input your output element ID/Class. I mean come on, what if you just wanted to output to the console? I also changed a few tweaks here and there.

##Legal
You can modify this file in any way, but if you want, create a pull request so I can have a look. Also, try not sell this file/work for a price. I mean come on, if you really want money, go get a proper job. Thirdly and lastly, you can not give away this file/work without giving credit to me, and possibly giving the URL to this Github page. Due to the informality of this piece of text, you could ignore this if you want to.

  - [Features](#features)
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Examples](#examples)
    - [Creating a proxy](#creating-a-proxy)
    - [Moving players from a server to another](#moving-players-from-a-server-to-another)
  - [Documentation](#documentation)

## Features

- Connect to proxy
- Forward players to servers
- Change server
- Basic plugin support, see `./src/Plugins/ChatCommands.js` for an example

## Installation

`npm install basic-minecraft-proxy`

## Examples

See also `./examples/` for other examples

### Creating a proxy

This example shows how to create a new proxy and how to the options are passed.

```js
const McProxy = require('minecraft-proxy');

let localServerOptions = {
  'port': '25578',
  'version': '1.12.1',
  'online-mode': false,
  'motd': 'nodejs minecraft proxy'
}

let serverList = {
  hub: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 25565,
    isDefault: true,
    isFallback: true
  },
  minigames: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 25566
  }
}

// if you leave proxyOptions empty yo may as well not pass it in the arguments, I wrote it anyway to point out that it exist
let proxyOptions = {}

/*
  Use the ""/server <serverName>"" command in chat to move between servers.
  <serverName> is the name that you chose for the server inside the serverList
  This command is implemented by /src/Plugins/ChatCommands.js and it can be disabled by setting enablePlugin: false inside proxyOptions
*/
let proxy = McProxy.createProxy(localServerOptions, serverList, proxyOptions);

proxy.on('error', console.error);

proxy.on('listening', () => {
  console.info('Listening!');
});
```

### Moving players from a server to another

In this example every player will be moved from the `hub` server (default) to the `minigames` server 30 seconds after having logged in.

```js
proxy.on('login', (player) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    proxy.setRemoteServer(player.id, ""minigames"");
  }, 30 * 1000);
});
```

Setting Up Environment
=====
You need A webserver such as Apache or Nginx, and PHP 5.6 or PHP 7.
Apache is preferred incase .htaccess is needed.

Check out repo, copy config.ini to config.dev.ini and edit to your needs.

You'll also need [NodeJS v6.9 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
You also need [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

Run `yarn` after checking out project to install node dependencies. (This replaces `npm install`)

To compile static resources and monitor them for changes, simply run `gulp` and control + c to abort watching.
Gulp will monitor all files for changes and recompile the css/js for you.

An initial debug data file is included in the project that will automatically load for dev environments.

You may create config.dev.ini to override config options like so:

>trusted_ip=""10.0.1.100""    
>dev_id=ae6cfe033ca541f39a0fc52c3b51b2e1


Timings File Format
======
The Timings v2 file format is not designed for public use. It is highly condensed and meant to be specially known how to parse it.

While the overall structure of the file is now done, we are still planning future additions to the data dump.

We ask that instead of trying to parse this file for your needs, to instead PR the change to this project instead so
everyone can benefit from it.

This file format is proprietary and may change without notice. 

License
======
Minecraft Timings (c) Daniel Ennis (Aikar) 2014-present.

I'd really prefer if clones did not start up for no good reason.

Remember: [when to fork](http://jamesdixon.wordpress.com/forking-protocol-why-when-and-how-to-fork-an-open-source-project/).

I'm totally open to any reasonable improvement. So if you think it can be better, talk to me on Spigot or Esper IRC and PR :)

If I disappear from Minecraft, then please keep this tool alive!

762,rackspace-orchestration-templates/minecraft,Python,"Description
===========

#### Production


Instructions
===========

#### Getting Started
Review the settings for your server to make sure they are in line with the
game you wish to run. For example, you can set whether or not to allow pvp.
The configuration file is in /home/minecraft/. The server can be restarted
by restarting the ""minecraft-server"" service.

#### Lock it down
This deployment will create a Cloud Server with Minecraft. Once the
server is online, you should set a white-list in your
[server.properties](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties)
file. This will lock down your server to only players you specify.

#### Logging in via SSH
The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
as well as [Windows using
PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).


Requirements
============
* A Heat provider that supports the following:
  * OS::Heat::SoftwareConfig
  * OS::Heat::SoftwareDeployment
  * OS::Nova::KeyPair
  * OS::Nova::Server
* An OpenStack username, password, and tenant id.
* [python-heatclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-heatclient)
`>= v0.2.8`:

```bash
pip install python-heatclient
```

We recommend installing the client within a [Python virtual
environment](http://www.virtualenv.org/).

Parameters
==========
Parameters can be replaced with your own values when standing up a stack. Use
the `-P` flag to specify a custom parameter.

* `minecraft_difficulty`: Difficulty level for Minecraft.  0 - Peaceful, 1 - Easy, 2 - Normal, 3 - Hard (Default: 2)
* `minecraft_monsters`: Enable or disable spawning of hostile mobs (Default: True)
* `minecraft_hardcore`: Enable or disable Hardcore mode.  In Hardcore mode, users will be banned from the server upon death (Default: False)
* `minecraft_animals`: Enable or disable spawning of passive mobs (Default: True)
* `minecraft_npcs`: Enable or disable spawning of villagers (Default: True)
* `minecraft_motd`: Message to be displayed in the server list (Default: A Minecraft Server)
* `minecraft_max_players`: Maximum number of players able to connect at any given time (Default: 20)
* `minecraft_online`: Online mode requires clients to have a valid Minecraft account. (Default: True)
* `server_flavor`: Flavor of Cloud Server to use for Minecraft (Default: 4 GB General Purpose v1)

Outputs
=======
Once a stack comes online, use `heat output-list` to see all available outputs.
Use `heat output-show <OUTPUT NAME>` to get the value of a specific output.

* `minecraft_public_ip`: Server Public IP 
* `ssh_private_key`: SSH Private Key 

For multi-line values, the response will come in an escaped form. To get rid of
the escapes, use `echo -e '<STRING>' > file.txt`. For vim users, a substitution
can be done within a file using `%s/\\n/\r/g`.

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/MrGraversen/minecraft-rcon.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#MrGraversen/minecraft-rcon)

A MineCraft RCON client in Java.

## About
The client is made to eventually automate some administrative actions of a MineCraft server. Every MineCraft command is exposed over RCON, and made available using this client.

Some of the RCON commands are fairly complex in structure; this client will provide convenience methods and builders to help developers construct the correct commands to get the job done.

The entire RCON command libarary is *not* implemeneted, but will be updated along the way. Feel free to PR and contribute with implementations of missing commands.

This project will also provide some convenience code for working with the MineCraft target selectors (e.g. `@a` and so on), the 16 colors of the game, different labels (time of day, game rules, etc.) and other constants.

Using the convenience methods will synchronously access the RCON stack, but it is also possible to send raw, asynchronous RCON messages.

**Warning:** There's a long-standing issue with MineCraft RCON which, for some reason, causes RCON commands to execute from a not-thread-safe queue (whereas the normal MineCraft action queue execute from a thread-safe queue) (https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-72390). Sometimes when executing many commands rapidly, e.g. giving a player *many* items, the game server will throw a `java.util.ConcurrentModificationException`, which sometimes casues it to crash entirely.  
I have, however, only seen this happening when I was really pushing it.

### What is RCON?
Originally invented by Valve for the Source Engine, it's a TCP/IP protocol for remote administration of game servers. The MineCraft RCON protocol is more-or-less an implementation of the Source Engine RCON protocol. It was introduced in beta update 1.9.

## Install

You may use JitPack to install this from the GitHub releases.  
Add the following to your `pom.xml` if using Maven (click the little JitPack badge for other build systems):

```
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>jitpack.io</id>
		<url>https://jitpack.io</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
```

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>io.github.MrGraversen</groupId>
	<artifactId>minecraft-rcon</artifactId>
	<version>0.0.16</version>
</dependency>
```

## Minecraft Configuration

To configure Minecraft RCON, you need to add/modify the following properties in your Minecraft server's `server.properties` file:

```
enable-rcon=true
rcon.password=abc123
rcon.port=<1-65535> (default: 25575)
broadcast-rcon-to-ops=false
```

Once done, RCON is available using this client.

## Example 1

The example is also available in the `io.graversen.minecraft.rcon.examples.Example1.java` class.

```java
// Define a simple MinecraftRconService
// Assuming Minecraft server is running on localhost and password set to ""test""
// If no port is specified, the default Minecraft RCON port will be used
final MinecraftRconService minecraftRconService = new MinecraftRconService(
	RconDetails.localhost(""test""),
	ConnectOptions.defaults()
);

// Let's go!
minecraftRconService.connectBlocking(Duration.ofSeconds(3));

// After connecting, we can (crudely) fetch the underlying Minecraft RCON provider
final MinecraftRcon minecraftRcon = minecraftRconService.minecraftRcon().orElseThrow(IllegalStateException::new);

// Build a TellRaw command - first half of the desired message
final TellRawCommand tellRawCommand1 = new TellRawCommandBuilder()
	.targeting(Selectors.ALL_PLAYERS)
	.withText(""It's dangerous to go alone - "")
	.withColor(Colors.GRAY)
	.italic()
	.build();


// Build another TellRaw command - other half of the message
final TellRawCommand tellRawCommand2 = new TellRawCommandBuilder()
	.targeting(Selectors.ALL_PLAYERS)
	.withText(""Take this!"")
	.withColor(Colors.DARK_AQUA)
	.italic()
	.build();

// We are able to transparently stitch together multiple 'tellraw' commands,
// combining their styles and texts into a composite viewing
final TellRawCompositeCommand tellRawCompositeCommand = new TellRawCompositeCommand(List.of(tellRawCommand1, tellRawCommand2));

// Let's also add a nice title to the players' screens
final TitleCommand titleCommand = new TitleCommandBuilder()
	.targeting(Selectors.ALL_PLAYERS)
	.atPosition(TitlePositions.TITLE)
	.withColor(Colors.GREEN)
	.withText(""Welcome!"")
	.build();

// We'll give everyone a diamond sword - it's dangerous without
final GiveCommand giveCommand = new GiveCommand(
	Selectors.ALL_PLAYERS.getSelectorString(), new MinecraftItem(""diamond_sword""), 1
);

// Fire away!
minecraftRcon.sendAsync(tellRawCompositeCommand, titleCommand, giveCommand);

// Just for fun, let's also change some other things

// Set time of day to noon and clear weather - nice and sunny
final TimeCommand timeCommand = new TimeCommand(TimeLabels.NOON);
final WeatherCommand weatherCommand = new WeatherCommand(Weathers.CLEAR, Duration.ofHours(1).toSeconds());
minecraftRcon.sendAsync(timeCommand, weatherCommand);

// The players hate it when their creations are blown up by Creepers, lets' help them
final ICommand disableMobGriefing = GameRulesCommands.setGameRule(GameRules.MOB_GRIEFING, false);
minecraftRcon.sendAsync(disableMobGriefing);
```

A bunch of miscellaneous patches for Minecraft. RandomPatches does **not** require Fabric API!

Also check out [RandomTweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/randomtweaks)!

**When reporting issues or suggesting enhancements, please use the**
**[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/TheRandomLabs/RandomPatches/issues), and make sure**
**you are on the latest version of the mod for your Minecraft version—it's easier to keep track**
**of things this way. Avoid commenting them on the CurseForge project page or sending them to me**
**in a direct message. Thank you!**

## Sponsor

I've partnered with Apex Hosting! In my experience, their servers are lag-free, easy to manage,
and of high quality. Check them out here:

## Aims

RandomPatches aims to be a highly configurable collection of bug fixes and quality of life
improvements for Minecraft, and additionally to allow several hardcoded settings to be configured.

When installed on a client, RandomPatches should be completely compatible with servers without the
mod, and when installed on a server, it should be completely compatible with clients without the
mod. As a result, clients can connect to a server with a different version of the mod to the one on
the server. Furthermore, RandomPatches contains no features that require the mod to be installed
both on the client and the server.

By default, RandomPatches aims to be as non-invasive as possible—there are no breaking changes to
game mechanics or conspicuous GUI additions. Indeed, with the default settings, the mod should be
virtually unnoticeable when one is not specifically looking for it. In addition, RandomPatches
should automatically disable any of its features that are implemented by another mod in order to
preserve compatibility wherever possible.

### How is RandomPatches different from RandomTweaks?

RandomPatches aims to not add or significantly modify any game mechanics. For instance,
auto-third person is a new minor game mechanic, so it belongs in RandomTweaks.
The distinction is blurrier for certain features—in these instances, features that require mixins
in the Forge version, such as removing the glowing effect from potions, and bug fixes, such as
the cauldron translucency fix, are put in RandomPatches.

## Features

Features without a specified side are server-sided.

### Connection timeouts

In vanilla Minecraft, the connection timeouts are hardcoded, and often not long enough for
slower computers or heavier modded instances. To counter this, RandomPatches allows several
connection timeouts to be configured:

* The connection read timeout
  * Both client and server-sided
  * Raised to 120 seconds from the vanilla value of 30 seconds by default
* The login timeout
  * How long the server waits for a player to log in
  * Raised to 2400 ticks (120 seconds) from the vanilla value of 600 ticks (30 seconds) by default
* The KeepAlive timeout
  * How long the server waits for a player to return a KeepAlive packet before disconnecting them
  * Raised to 120 seconds from the vanilla value of 30 seconds by default

In addition, RandomPatches allows the interval at which KeepAlive packets are sent to clients
to be configured, although it is recommended that this be left at the vanilla value of 15 seconds.
</details>

### Packet size limits

RandomPatches allows several packet size limits to be configured, which by default are raised from
the vanilla limits:

* Maximum compressed packet size
  * This option is both client and server-sided.
  * Setting this to a higher value than the vanilla limit can fix
  [MC-185901](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-185901), which may cause players to be disconnected.
* Maximum NBT compound tag packet size
  * This option is both client and server-sided.
  * Setting this to a higher value than the vanilla limit may prevent players from being
  disconnected.
* Maximum client custom payload packet size
  * Setting this to a higher value than the vanilla limit may prevent the client from being
  disconnected.

This feature makes [XL Packets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xl-packets-fabric)
redundant, but the maximum compressed packet size and maximum NBT compound tag packet size cannot
be configured when XL Packets is installed.

This feature is made redundant by [Krypton](https://github.com/astei/krypton), a network
optimization mod. Check it out if you want!

### Player speed limits

In vanilla Minecraft, the player speed limits are hardcoded, and set to values that are often
not high enough in certain cases. As a result, rubber banding occurs, and
`[Player] moved too quickly!` is spammed in the log. To prevent this, RandomPatches changes the
following player speed limits to a higher value by default:

* Default maximum player speed
* Maximum player elytra speed
* Maximum player vehicle speed

This fixes [MC-90062](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-90062).

### Boat options

The following options related to boats can be modified:

* Boat buoyancy under flowing water
  * In vanilla Minecraft, this is set to a negative value, causing it to be impossible for boats to
  flow up when they move up into a higher block of water.
  * This problem is reported as [MC-91206](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-91206), and has been
  marked as ""Works As Intended"".
  * By default, RandomPatches sets this to a positive value to counteract this.
* Underwater boat passenger delay
  * This is how long it takes for a boat passenger to be ejected when underwater.
  * This can be set to -1 to disable underwater boat passenger ejection.

### Disable DataFixerUpper

This disables the execution of DataFixerUpper, reducing RAM usage and decreasing the Minecraft
loading time. However, this feature is disabled by default, and enabling it is **not recommended**,
as DataFixerUpper is responsible for the backwards compatibility of worlds. Even so, if you insist
on disabling DataFixerUpper:

* Ensure you have used the Optimize feature on any worlds from previous versions of Minecraft before
enabling this feature.
* Before migrating worlds to new versions of Minecraft, ensure this feature is disabled, and use the
Optimize feature again before re-enabling it.
* Take regular backups of your worlds.

Although worlds last played on an older or newer version of Minecraft theoretically cannot be loaded
when DataFixerUpper is disabled by RandomPatches, it's better to be safe than sorry.

To be clear, **RandomPatches is not responsible for any damage caused by this feature.**

### Fix [MC-2025](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-2025)

Because of floating point precision errors, the bounding box of an entity can be calculated as
smaller than the expected value. When the entity is saved then reloaded, the bounding box may be
recomputed such that it intersects a wall. To counter this, RandomPatches stores the bounding box
when an entity is saved, then makes it use the same bounding box when it is loaded.

For more information, see [this Reddit post](https://redd.it/8pgd4q) from which this fix comes from.

### Fix animal breeding hearts

RandomPatches fixes animals which can breed only showing hearts once instead of continuously.
Thanks to [Fuzs_](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/breeding-hearts) for finding this
fix!

This bug is reported as [MC-93826](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-93826).

### Fix duplicate entity UUIDs

RandomPatches fixes duplicate entity UUIDs and the resulting log spam by assigning new UUIDs to the
affected entities. This fix was found by
[CAS_ual_TY](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deuf-duplicate-entity-uuid-fix).

This bug is reported as [MC-95649](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-95649).

### Fix recipe book not moving ingredients with tags

In vanilla Minecraft, the recipe book does not automatically transfer ingredients with NBT tags to
the crafting grid. RandomPatches fixes this issue.

This bug is reported as [MC-129057](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-129057).

This feature is disabled if
[Nbt Crafting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nbt-crafting) is installed.

### Fix entities not being considered wet in cauldrons

In vanilla Minecraft, entities are not considered wet in cauldrons filled with water. RandomPatches
fixes this issue, allowing players to use Riptide in cauldrons filled with water, fixing
[MC-145311](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-145311). In addition, this fix allows players to
receive the Conduit Power effect in cauldrons filled with water.

It should be noted that the MC-145311 fix works client-side only. Please be mindful of server rules
when using this feature.

### Fix mobs not crossing rails

In vanilla Minecraft, mobs are unable to cross rails. RandomPatches fixes this issue.

This bug is reported as [MC-33359](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-33359), and has been marked as
""Works as Intended"".

### Fix boat fall damage

In vanilla Minecraft, boats and players in boats do not take fall damage.
RandomPatches fixes this issue.

This bug is reported as both [MC-98160](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-98160) and
[MC-105103](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-105103).

### Fix player head stacking

In vanilla Minecraft, player heads from the same player sometimes do not stack. RandomPatches
fixes this issue by forcing Minecraft to treat two player heads as equal if they are from the same
player, and by default, if they have the same texture URL.

This bug is reported as [MC-100044](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-100044).

### Fix water in cauldrons rendering as opaque (client-sided)

In vanilla Minecraft, water in cauldrons renders as opaque. RandomPatches fixes this issue by
making them render as translucent as intended.

also affects witches. RandomPatches fixes this issue.

With RandomPatches:

![Villager robe textures with RandomPatches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRandomLabs/RandomPatches/misc/Villager%20robe%20textures%20with%20RandomPatches.png)

This bug is reported as [MC-53312](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-53312).

### Fix invisible player model (client-sided)

In certain instances in vanilla Minecraft, the player model sometimes disappears. This is most
noticeable when flying with elytra in a straight line in third-person mode:

[![Invisible player model bug](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YdbxknpfJHQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdbxknpfJHQ ""Invisible Player Model Bug"")

RandomPatches fixes this issue. Again, thanks to [Fuzs_](https://www.curseforge.com/members/fuzs_)
for finding this fix!

### Key bindings (client-sided)

RandomPatches makes the narrator toggle key binding configurable in the controls screen,
fixing [MC-122645](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-122645).
If [Amecs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/amecs) is installed, this key binding is set
to `Control + b` by default, which is the vanilla default. Otherwise, it is unbound by default.

In addition, RandomPatches makes the following key bindings configurable, largely fixing
[MC-147718](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-147718):

* Pause
  * This is only for pausing and unpausing the game; the Escape key is still used to close GUI
  screens.
* Toggle GUI
* Toggle Debug Info
* The F3 key is still used for F3 actions.

Furthermore, RandomPatches adds a second configurable key binding for sprinting, which allows the
double-tap sprint functionality to be disabled, fixing
[MC-203401](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-203401). Moreover, RandomPatches allows double-tap
sprinting while flying, fixing [MC-68453](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-68453).

Additionally, RandomPatches adds a dismount key binding, which allows the dismount key to be
different from the sneak key.

### Window title and icon (client-sided)

By default, RandomPatches removes the annoying `*` in the Minecraft window title that indicates
that the game is modded. In addition, the following window properties can be configured:

* Title
  * Several variables are provided:
    * `${mcversion}`: Minecraft version
    * `${activity}`: Current activity (not available in the normal title)
    * `${username}`: Username
    * `${modsloaded}`: Number of mods loaded
    * `${modversion:modid}`: Version of the mod with the specified ID
  * '$' can be escaped by using an extra '$'.
* 16x16 icon
* 32x32 icon
* 256x256 icon (only takes effect on Mac OS X)

### Optimize bamboo rendering (client-sided)

RandomPatches optimizes bamboo rendering. This works by overriding the method that returns the
ambient occlusion light value for the bamboo block, which runs some expensive logic, but always
returns `1.0F`.

Thanks to [darkevilmac](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fast-bamboo) for finding this fix!

### Remove glowing effect from potions (client-sided)

By default, RandomPatches removes the glowing effect from potions, making potion colors more
visible.

Without RandomPatches:

![Potions without RandomPatches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRandomLabs/RandomPatches/misc/Potions%20without%20RandomPatches.png)

With RandomPatches:

![Potions with RandomPatches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRandomLabs/RandomPatches/misc/Potions%20with%20RandomPatches.png)

### Remove glowing effect from enchanted books (client-sided)

RandomPatches can remove the glowing effect from enchanted books. This feature is disabled by
default.

Without RandomPatches:

![Enchanted books without RandomPatches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRandomLabs/RandomPatches/misc/Enchanted%20books%20without%20RandomPatches.png)

With RandomPatches:

![Enchanted books with RandomPatches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRandomLabs/RandomPatches/misc/Enchanted%20books%20with%20RandomPatches.png)

### Disable experimental settings warning (client-sided)

By default, RandomPatches disables the warning that displays when loading a world that uses
experimental settings:

![Experimental settings warning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRandomLabs/RandomPatches/misc/Experimental%20settings%20warning.png)

### Framerate limit slider step size (client-sided)

In vanilla Minecraft, the framerate limit slider step size is 10.0. RandomPatches changes this to
1.0 by default.

This does not work when OptiFine is installed.

### Return to main menu after disconnect (client-sided)

This feature makes Minecraft return to the main menu screen after disconnecting rather than the
Realms or multiplayer screen.

## Configuration

The RandomPatches configuration can be found at `config/randompatches.toml`.

* All properties and categories should be well-commented such that there is little need for further
explanation.
* All configuration values should be automatically validated and reset if they are invalid.
* A configuration GUI can be accessed from
[Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu).
* In case of unaddressed compatibility issues, individual mixins can be disabled through the mixin
blacklist.
  * Most mixins are not automatically disabled when the features that depend on them are.
  * This is done to allow features to be enabled or disabled in-game without the need for restarts.
  * A list of these mixins can be found in the comments for the mixin blacklist.
  * **Please report an issue if you need to use the mixin blacklist to resolve a conflict.**
* The configuration can be reloaded from disk in-game through the use of a command
(`/rpconfigreload` by default).

766,grakkit/grakkit,Java,"![Project Logo](./logo.png)

**Grakkit** - It's the fusion of GraalVM, JavaScript, and Minecraft.

![Code Demo](./demo.gif)

If you want to get in touch with the community, join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/e682hwR) and we can assist you with whatever problem you may have.

# Getting Started

## IMPORTANT
Grakkit was designed to run on standard JDK, which means it comes pre-packaged with the GraalJS engine! This pre-packaged engine WILL conflict with the GraalVM JVM, so please use standard JDK to run servers running Grakkit!

## Installation
Head on over to the [releases](https://github.com/grakkit/grakkit/releases) page and grab the latest version for your platform. After that, just drop the JAR in whatever **plugins**, **mods**, or **extensions** folder you would install any other plugin, mod, or extension.

## Your First Project (Bukkit/Spigot/Paper)
Upon starting or reloading the server with the plugin installed, the `plugins/grakkit` folder will be created on your server. This is where most if not all development will take place, and serves as your home when working within the scope of grakkit.

Given that Grakkit is community-driven, there are tons of NPM modules you can install to add rich support and typings for the game. For now, the most widely-used package is `@grakkit/stdlib-paper`, a standard library for JavaScript development with PaperMC servers. To install it, make sure you have NodeJS installed, then navigate to `plugins/grakkit` in a terminal or command prompt and use `npm install @grakkit/stdlib-paper`.

For those working on a remote server, you can simply install the package to a local directory, then copy that directory's contents to the remote server's `plugins/grakkit` folder. This works because grakkit itself doesn't need NodeJS installed, it's merely the template used for package management.

Once that's done, you can import it from within your main file (default `index.js`) as shown below...
```js
const stdlib = require('@grakkit/stdlib-paper');
```

Upon the next server reload, the above code will be executed. Requiring this package also adds the in-game `/js` command, which can be used to test and execute code from within the game -- for example, running `/js self` will show a representation of the player or console sending the command, and you can use `/js core.reload()` to reload the JS environment without having to reload the entire server.

## Your First Project (Minestom)
Grakkit for [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) is available as a standalone ""extension."" Download it from our [latest release]() page. Make sure to download the correct platform, labeled `grakkit-x.y.z.minestom.jar`.
The installation process and usage is very similar to that of bukkit/spigot/paper's, however the two key differences are **a).** it's an _extension_ and should be placed in the extensions directory rather than plugins, and **b).** it uses different modules to complete the Environment™, notably-being `@grakkit/stdlib-minestom`.

Grakkit for Minestom is still in its early days, however it's the best we've got as far as scripting in a performant environment like Minestom.

## Other Platforms
Grakkit is currently only available for servers implementing the Bukkit or Minestom's API. Check out [Other Implementations](https://github.com/grakkit/grakkit/wiki/Other-Implementations) to find alternatives for your platform!

## Further Reading
For more info about Grakkit, modules, the JS command, and more, head on over to the [wiki](https://github.com/grakkit/grakkit/wiki) and read up. ***Attention:** This wiki is slightly outdated and only applies to servers. Many of the code samples in here may still work, but some may not. Use at your own risk!*

For another useful guide to getting started, check out [Start Your Environment](https://github.com/grakkit/grakkit/wiki/HowTo-Start-Environment).

Additional documentation can be found at [API](/docs/api.md).

```


### Using Rendering API

```ts
import { Minecraft } from 'minecraft-render';
import fs from 'fs';

async function main() {
  const minecraft = Minecraft.open('./minecraft-version.1.17.1.jar');
  const blocks = await minecraft.getBlockList();

  for await (const block of minecraft.render(blocks)) {
    if (!block.buffer) {
      console.log(`${block.blockName} skipped due to ${block.skip}`);
      continue;
    }

    await fs.promises.writeFile(`./render/${block.blockName}.png`, block.buffer);
  }
}
```


### Tests

Current test configuration is capable of downloading jar files from mojang servers and execute render sequence. You can trigger tests with;

```sh
npm test
```

### Headless render and CI

If you are automating generation process on github or similar CI environments, make sure you configured display server. `xvfb` can be used for this purpose.

```sh
sudo apt-get install xvfb
xvfb-run --auto-servernum minecraft-render ...
```

769,packwiz/packwiz,Go,"# packwiz
packwiz is a command line tool for creating Minecraft modpacks. Instead of managing JAR files directly, packwiz creates TOML metadata files which can be easily version-controlled and shared with git (see an example pack [here](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-example-pack)). You can then [export it to a CurseForge or Modrinth modpack](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/hosting/curseforge/), or [use packwiz-installer](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/) for an auto-updating MultiMC instance.

packwiz is great for...

- Distributing private modpacks for servers
- Creating modpacks for CurseForge and Modrinth

packwiz is not so great for...

- Managing downloaded mod files (use [Curse/GDLauncher or another CLI](https://gist.github.com/comp500/13ae6f058221196077fb19953ac608c7))
- People who want a GUI (though there are some [third-party efforts](https://github.com/ExoPlant/packwiz-gui))

Join my Discord server if you need help [here](https://discord.gg/Csh8zbbhCt)!

## Features
- Git-friendly TOML-based metadata format
- MultiMC pack installer/updater, with support for optional mods and fast automatic updates - perfect for servers!
- Pack distribution with HTTP servers, with a built in local server for testing
- Easy installation and updating of multiple mods at once from CurseForge and Modrinth
- Exporting to CurseForge and Modrinth packs
- Importing from CurseForge packs
- Server-only and Client-only mod handling
- Creation of remote file metadata from JAR files for CurseForge mods

## Installation
Prebuilt binaries are available from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz/actions) - the UI is a bit terrible, but essentially select the top build, then download the artifact ZIP for your system at the bottom of the page. To run the executable, add the folder where you downloaded it to your PATH environment variable ([see tutorial for Windows here](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/)) or move it to where you want to use it.

In future I will have a lot more installation options, but you can also compile from source:

1. Install Go (1.18 or newer) from https://golang.org/dl/
2. Run `go install github.com/packwiz/packwiz@latest`. Be patient, it has to download and compile dependencies as well!

#### 基础使用

##### 与服务器对接

只需要修改index.php中第3行的`$host`后面的内容为你的域名/IP和修改第4行的`$port`后面为你的端口号（可以是游戏用的端口也可以是query端口，但是query要自己手动开启而且是UDP协议）

##### 更多修改

只需要将`index.php`文件开头几行的变量修改一下就行了（PS：头像的反代请去把`https://cravatar.eu`自行替换成自己的反代链接）

```php
$host = ""mc.example.com""; //设置服务器域名或 IP
$port = ""25565""; //设置服务器端口，可以直接用服务器的链接端口，也可以使用query端口（UDP协议）

777,Ichbinjoe/MCAuthenticator,Java,"# MCAuthenticator

MCAuthenticator is a Bukkit API based plugin designed to allow for 2 Factor 
Authentication (otherwise known as TOTP, or the Time-Based One-Time Password 
Algorithm ([RFC6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238))) for all players on a server to optionally use, with configurable 
enforcement for certain players through permission nodes. This is designed to
allow for more secure minecraft server environments, especially when account
cracking and hacking are so prevalent. This plugin reduces the risk of a 
compromised staff account greatly, making it much harder to compromise a 
staff account and compromise a server in general.

+ [Microsoft Authenticator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458)

## Installation

To install MCAuthenticator, you simply put the `MCAuthenticator.jar` within
the `plugins/` folder of your Bukkit/Spigot/BungeeCord server. Once you start the 
server, the plugin will generate a configuration as described below.

### Compatibility

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ichbinjoe/MCAuthenticator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Ichbinjoe/MCAuthenticator)

MCAuthenticator is tested with Spigot 1.8.8, on Java 8. However, MCAuthenticator
is compatible with Java 7, and there is no reason it shouldn't work with Bukkit
1.6.x or 1.7.x servers. We will officially support 1.6.x spigot and up.

If you find issues on any server versions 1.6.x and up, please report them in
issues.

## Commands

MCAuthenticator uses 1 root command, /auth (with aliases /2fa, 
/authenticator, and /mcauthenticator) with a set of sub commands:

+ /auth enable \[player\] - Enables 2FA on an account, or your own account if
 a player isn't specified.
+ /auth disable \[player\] - Disables 2FA on an account, or your own account 
if a player isn't specified.
+ /auth reset \[player\] - Keeps 2FA enabled, but resets the 2FA on your 
account or another player's if player is specified.
+ /auth reload - Reloads the configuration, then re-authenticates all players 
based on configured authentication rules.

## Permissions

MCAuthenticator uses the root permission `mcauthenticator`, with a set of sub
permissions to control the behaviour of various aspects of the plugin.

#### Explanation of defaults
Each permission has one of two defaults: op and console only. If a permission
is defaulting to console only, even if a player has op, they will not be able
to perform the command unless they __explicitly__ have the listed permission.

### Command controlling permissions
+ `mcauthenticator.use` (default: op) - Allows for the root use of the /auth
 command. In order to do anything with the /auth command, the player __must__
 have this permission.
+ `mcauthenticator.enable` (default: op) - Allows for the user to do /auth 
 enable on themselves. This does not control whether the player is allowed to 
 have 2FA enabled on their account; if console or a player with `mcauthenticator.enable.other` 
 enables 2FA on their account, the plugin will let them.
+ `mcauthenticator.disable` (default: op) - Allows for the user to do /auth 
 disable on themselves.
+ `mcauthenticator.enable.other` (default: console only) - Allows for the user 
 to perform /auth enable <player>, enabling authentication for another player.
 The other player does not need to have `mcauthenticator.enable` in order to 
 have 2FA enabled on their account.
+ `mcauthenticator.disable.other` (default: console only) - Allows for the user
 to perform /auth disable <player>, disabling another player's authentication.
+ `mcauthenticator.reset` (default: op) - Allows for a player to reset their
 own account's authentication.
+ `mcauthenticator.reset.other` (default: console only) - Allows for the user
 to reset other user's authentications.
+ `mcauthenticator.reload` (default: console only) - Allows for the user to
 reload the configuration
 
### Enforcement Permissions
+ `mcauthenticator.lock` (default: op) - Does one of 2 things:
  1. Forces the user to always 2FA enabled, not allowing them to disable or
    reset their own authentication
  2. Does not allow anyone but console to reset or disable their authentication.
    Even if the user has any of the `.other` permission nodes, the plugin will
    __not__ allow them to perform any changes to authentication. This should
    be given to any staff members, as it will prevent any other compromised
    account from then chainly compromising other staff (or important persons)
    accounts.

## Configuration

The configuration of the plugin can be default out of the box, but it is highly
suggested that at least some of the configuration defaults be customized to your
server.

All of the configuration is located in `plugins/MCAuthenticator/config.yml`. Each
of the configuration options listed below are all located within this yml.

### Available Authentication Mechanisms

Since `1.1.0`, MCAuthentication has supported multiple types of
authentication mechanisms:

+ 2fa
+ Yubikey

Each of these can be turned on and off within the config file under
`authenticators`. When setting up 2FA, the user may use any of the
configured authentication mechanisms. The plugin will auto-detect which
mechanism they use, and authenticate them off of only that method in the
future.

### Yubikey

In order to offer authentication through Yubikey, you must have a
`clientId` as well as a `clientSecret`. Both of these are offered at
https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/. If you do not add these
api credentials, Yubikey authentication will not function correctly.
These should be entered under `yubikey` within the configuration.

### GAuth

The `serverIp` field specifies what will be displayed to the user within their
2FA app.

For example, with a username `Ichbinjoe` and `serverIp` set to `ibj.io`, a sample
GAuth entry will look like the following:

![Sample GAuth Entry](https://ibj.io/imgs/example_auth.png ""Sample GAuth Entry"")

### Forcing Same IP Authentication

By default, MCAuthenticator does not force a player to re-authenticate if they rejoin
from the last IP they were authenticated from. This can be disabled by setting
`forceSameIPAuthentication` to true. When set to true, the plugin force the user to 
re-authenticate through 2FA each and every time they log into the server.

### Message customization

Under the `messages` section of the configuration, MCAuthenticator allows you to 
customize all publicly displayed messages, in order to modify color schemes and 
the prefix to better fit your server's color scheme/language requirements. All
staff commands are hardcoded, simply because there is much less of a reason to
customize these messages.

Each entry supports `&<opcode>` based colorcodes, as well as the `\n` character
for splitting up messages onto multiple lines. Where contextually logical, a
`%player%` replacement has been added to customize each message based on occurrence.

### Data Source Configuration

MCAuthenticator supports 1 of 3 different data sources:

+ Single File - Stores all player data in one file
+ Directory - Stores each player in their own file within a directory
+ MySQL - Stores all player data within a table in a MySQL/MariaDB table.

#### Single File Data Source

To enable the single file data source, `dataBacking.type` should be set to `single`.
The file to which the single file data source saves to is configured by setting 
`dataBacking.file`. This file is then by default present in `plugins/MCAuthenticator`

#### Directory Data Source

To enable the directory data source, `dataBacking.type` should be set to `directory`.
The directory to which all of the player data is saved is configured by the
`dataBacking.directory` field. Within this directory, a file for each player,
structured `<uuid>.json` stores a single JSON object with the authentication
details.

#### MySQL Data Source

To enable the MySQL data source, `dataBacking.type` should be set to `mysql`.
The database connection details should then be set in `dataBacking.mysql`.
The default connection url is `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3000/db`, with the format
`jdbc:mysql://<ip>:<port>/<databaseName>`. `username` and `password` should also
be set to a username and password that is able to access the database.

## Building MCAuthenticator

To build MCAuthenticator, run `mvn package` in a command terminal, and the
result of the build will save the jar to `target/MCAuthenticator-<version>.jar`.

### BungeeCord Mode

BungeeCord support will only require one authentication per player join, not every
time the player switches servers, does not require same IP to be true, and will deny
BungeeCord commands until the player is authenticated. To enable BungeeCord support,
`enable` under the `bungee` should be set to `true`, and `channel` should be set to
the same channel as the BungeeCord plugin's `pluginChannel` is set to. BungeeCord
mode requires that the plugin also be installed on the BungeeCord instance(s).

The main public facing api is the [Authenticator](src/main/java/net/hycrafthd/minecraft_authenticator/login/Authenticator.java) class. 
This class is documented and you should have a look here about more information. The following code snippets are just some simple usage demonstrations.

### Here is a simple login with microsoft

```java
// Build authenticator
final Authenticator authenticator = Authenticator.ofMicrosoft(authorizationCode).shouldAuthenticate().build();
try {
	// Run authentication
	authenticator.run();
} catch (final AuthenticationException ex) {
	// Always check if result file is present when an exception is thrown
	final AuthenticationFile file = authenticator.getResultFile();
	if (file != null) {
		// Save authentication file
		file.writeCompressed(outputStream);
	}
	
	// Show user error or rethrow
	throw ex;
}

// Save authentication file
final AuthenticationFile file = authenticator.getResultFile();
file.writeCompressed(outputStream);

// Get user
final Optional<User> user = authenticator.getUser();
```

### Here is an login with an existing authentication file to refresh the session

```java
// Build authenticator
final Authenticator authenticator = Authenticator.of(existingAuthFile).shouldAuthenticate().build();
try {
	// Run authentication
	authenticator.run();
} catch (final AuthenticationException ex) {
	// Always check if result file is present when an exception is thrown
	final AuthenticationFile file = authenticator.getResultFile();
	if (file != null) {
		// Save authentication file
		file.writeCompressed(outputStream);
	}
	
	// Show user error or rethrow
	throw ex;
}

// Save authentication file
final AuthenticationFile file = authenticator.getResultFile();
file.writeCompressed(outputStream);

// Get user
final Optional<User> user = authenticator.getUser();
```

### Here is a login with a custom azure application and the retrieval of xbox profile settings

```java
// Build authenticator
final Authenticator authenticator = Authenticator.ofMicrosoft(authorizationCode)
	.customAzureApplication(clientId, redirectUrl)
	.shouldRetrieveXBoxProfile()

782,Podshot/MCEdit-Unified,Python,"# MCEdit-Unified

MCEdit-Unified is an updated fork of the original MCEdit by Codewarrior. The previous license still applies. MCEdit-Unified is an open-source, BSD-licensed world editor for the viral indie hit [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/). For downloads and update info, visit the official website at [podshot.github.io/MCEdit-Unified](http://podshot.github.io/MCEdit-Unified/). The rest of this file is intended for computer programmers, Linux/Mac users, and those who wish to run from source.

## Localisation

This version implements localisation functions.
The resource files are located in the 'lang' folder for MCEdit UI.

Custom brushes and filters can be also translated, provided a folder named like the base name of the brush/filter file (without the '.py' extension) can be found alongside the file and contains the resources.
These resources have to be built with the same rules than MCEdit ones.

The UI fixed character strings can appear in users native language by simply editing translation files.
It is also possible to (re)build the language template and files and to use custom fonts.

See TRANSLATION.txt for further details.

Developers don't have to tweak their code so much.
The only modifications concern strings which need text formatting or concatenation.
See README.txt in `albow` subfolder for further information.

-- D.C.-G. (LaChal)

## Random splash screens

MCEdit now displays random splash screens at startup.

You can make your own and add it in the `splashes` folder. The name of the file does not matter. Just pay attention it is a PNG image.

There isn't any MCEdit setting to enable or disable this feature for now.
The `splash` file in the MCEdit install folder handles it. It is a plain text file, and it contains the name of an image to be used as a splash screen.

To unactivate the random splash screens, edit the `splash` file and delete its content.
If you delete the file, it will be generated again, and the feature will be activated.

## Running from source

### Requirements

These programs and packages are required:

**General**

* git
* Python 2.7+ (Python 3 is unsupported)
  * If you use Unicode characters in any of your file paths, you **need** to use 2.7.14
* virtualenv (not strictly required, but highly recommended)

**Python packages**

* [pygame 1.9.4](http://pygame.org/install.html)
* PyOpenGL 3.1.1a1
* PyOpenGL-accelerate 3.1.1a1
* numpy 1.15.0
* Pillow 5.2.0
* cython 0.28.4
* python-xlib 0.14
* ftputil 3.4 (Optional, but FTP server support will be disabled without it)
* pyClark (Optional, but error reporting will be disabled without it)

On Windows, these are also required (Either one works, pypiwin32 is recommended):

* pywin32
* pypiwin32

### 1. Clone repo

Clone the repo (recursively, to also clone submodules):

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Podshot/MCEdit-Unified
```

### 2. Install dependencies

#### Linux

On Linux, these may be installed at the system level with your distro package manager.

If they are not available, you can install them using `pip install --user PACKAGE`.  In this case, you should set up the virtualenv first, like this:

```sh
cd MCEdit-Unified  # Enter the repo directory
virtualenv virtualenv  # Create new virtualenv in ""virtualenv"" directory
source virtualenv/bin/activate  # Deactivate by running ""deactivate"" when done
```

**Note about python-xlib:** Some Linux distros do not have version 0.14 of python-xlib.  In this case, you should install it with `pip` (either in a virtualenv, or after removing the system package).

#### Debian/Ubuntu

On Debian and Ubuntu, the Python packages may be installed from distro repositories like this:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python-opengl python-pygame python-yaml python-numpy python-xlib
```

#### Mac OS X and Windows

The Python packages may be installed using `pip install --user PACKAGE`.

### 3. Run

#### Linux

Run `mcedit.sh`.

#### Windows

Run `python mcedit.py`.

## BUILDING NBT AND PNG SUPPORT

__Please, mind to adapt the following information according to your operating system!__

### DEPENDENCIES

To build these libaries, you'll need _Cython 0.21_ and _setuptools_.

First, install or update _setuptools_:

* Download [get-pypi.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)
* Run it: `python pypi.py`

Then, install Cython:

`pip install cython==0.21.2`


### SETUP SCRIPT

This script is intended to be run in a shell opened in MCEdit-Unified folder.

It takes arguments on the command line to work correctly.
Invoke it like this:

`python setup.py <argument> [argument [argument [...]]]`

Without argument, it will fail. (And let you know...)


Use the `all` argument to build all the libraries the script can handle.  
The `nbt` one will build only the NBT support.  
The `png` one will build only the PNG support.  
The `help` one can, ehhh, help...

After the NBT support is built, you can run a very simple test:

`python setuptest.py`


### Pocket Edition Support

MCPE support requires a special library. MCEdit will run without it, but you will not be able to edit Pocket worlds.

This library is embeded in the packages for OSX and Windows, and will mostly work.

On Linux systems, it is necessary to compile the library, because it requires to be linked to `zlib` one on the system.
It may be necessary to compile `zlib` specifically for the PE support if the one on the system is not compatible. (It may also happen this library is not on the system...)

The Python script `setup_leveldb.py` in the `pymclevel` directory wuill build the PE support, and the `zlib` library when needed.
Read `INSTALL_LEVELDB` in the `pymclevel` directory for more information.

Note that, if you use the installer for Linux, this script is used during installation to build the library.

([[Compilation on Windows and OSX part to be written.]])

It is possible to enable a debug mode for PE support by running MCEdit with the `--debug-pe` option on the command line.
Some messages will be displayed in the console. A lot of information will be stored in a `dump_pe.txt` file. This file can be very big, so be carefull with this debug mode!
You can use this option several times to get more information in the file. Currently, using this option more than 2 times will have no effect.

## New features test mode

Some unfinished features and fixes may be included in future MCEdit-Unified releases, this inactive code can be activated using the process below. Use at your own risk.

To use:

* Open your operating system's command console.
* Go to the directory where MCEdit is installed (Mac users need to open their .app file).
* Create a text file named `new_features.def`
* In this file, add a feature per line. (Unfinished features/fixes are available on request from the developers))
* Run MCEdit-Unified with the command line option `--new-features`

These 'new features' will change during the program development. Features may be added or removed at will and may not work at all, most will eventually end up in a release as a normal feature. No documentation is provided for them, except in the code source itself.

We recommend you to use this only if you have at least some familiarity with programming and source code, or if requested by a developer.
We highly recommend backing up your worlds (and even the whole game) before using this function, even if requested by the devs.

784,toger5/Godot-Voxel-Game-MineCraftClone,GDScript,"# Godot-Voxel-Game-MineCraftClone
This is a Godot project. The main purpose of this project is to get familier with the Godot game engine.

![GitHub Logo](/screenshots/screenshot1.PNG)

**Project Overview**  
To achive a decent performance and as a consequence a decent rendering distance of the world I only generate the top surface of the terrain (so the surface is created out of one single plane and not by multiple cubes (as I did it in the minecraft blender game engine project on my git hub page))
Therefore I used the godot datatool to manipulate and create single face and UV maps.

**how to test**  
If you want to test the game:
* just download or clone the repository
* than download Godot [Godot](http://www.godotengine.org/)
* start the Godot client
* scan for project and choose the downloaded unzipped folder

**features**  

Until now there are only a few things working:  
- [x] there is a randomly created voxel engine based on dictionaries
- [x] A surface mesh is generated where needed with proper UV mapping
- [x] Physic bodies are created so there is interaction with the world
- [x] Basic character controls to explore the world...

Some features which I'm planning to implement:

- [ ] you still can't build or destroy blocks. Because I have to manipulate the surface to get new blocks or to destroy a Voxel this is not as easy than just adding a cube mesh.

It comes with an extensive config file (and GUI), and allows you to modify WorldGen greatly! With Geolosys, realistic mineral versions of common ores are added for many variants commonly used in modpacks.

Compatibility:

- Vanilla Stones (Diorite, Andesite, Granite)
- Vanilla Resources (Iron, Gold, Diamond, Emerald, Redstone, Coal, Lapis and Quartz)
- Common Mod Resources (Copper, Tin, Silver, Lead, Aluminum, Nickel, Platinum, Uranium, Zinc)
- Mekanism (Osmium)
- Big/Extreme Reactors (Uranium)

Don't see an ore or stone you want included? There's a config section for you! You can add any block you want and Geolosys will handle generating it in the same manner it generates its own ores! You can even specify a Cluster block for the surface if you want!

## Compiling

Geolosys has no crazy compilation process; all you have to do is download the repository as a zip (or clone it, your choice) and run either:

Windows Systems:
`.\gradlew.bat build`

macOS / Linux / Unix Systems:
`./gradle build`

Built files are found in `builds/libs` within the repository directory.

## Pull Requests

Are welcome! Just please document what it is you have changed via your PR Comment and / or commit messages. I would rather not dig through your code to figure out what has been changed :)

## Issues

Issues should follow the issues template provided. If they don't, don't be surprised if the issue is marked invalid.

For issues regarding Geolosys world generation, include both `geolosys_ores.json` as well as `geolosys.cfg`. It's impossible to figure out what the exact case is for world generation if I'm not sure what variables have been changed.

786,flathub/com.mojang.Minecraft,Shell,"# Minecraft (Flatpak)

Welcome to the unofficial [Flathub distribution of Minecraft](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.mojang.Minecraft). To get started, as customary for the installation of any Flathub app, make sure to follow the [setup guide](https://flatpak.org/setup/) before installing the Minecraft Flatpak.

## Usage Notes

For non-vanilla Minecraft players, please read these important usage notes.

#### Resource Packs, Modifications, etc.

If you want to use various resource packs or modifications (mods), you can transfer the resources (typically `.jar` files) to `~/.var/app/com.mojang.Minecraft/.minecraft`.

#### Minecraft Forge

A common way to use Minecraft resource packs and modifications is through Minecraft Forge. Essentially, Forge will act as an entire Minecraft instance that you will launch. Each Minecraft Forge instance is versioned similarly to regular Minecraft instances (e.g. one instance for Forge 1.7.10, another instance for Forge 1.15.2). Note that each Forge version corresponds to a regular Minecraft instance of that version, only modded to allow for easy resource pack and mod installations.

To install, download a version of Minecraft Forge from their [official website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/). This will be a `.jar` file. Once you download the `.jar` file, open it from your File Manager or using a terminal by executing `java -jar /path/to/your/download/location/forge*.jar` (you need to have Java Runtime Environment installed on your system). This will launch the forge installation window. There, navigate to `~/.var/app/com.mojang.Minecraft/.minecraft` and click ""OK"" (screenshot shown below).

![Forge Installation](screenshots/forge.png)

Now, when you restart the Minecraft launcher, you will see a new Minecraft listed clearly with ""Forge"" and the version number you installed. Happy modding!

## Steam Deck

Please note that Minecraft Launcher currently [has a bug](https://github.com/flathub/com.mojang.Minecraft/issues/116#issuecomment-1054724391) causing Microsoft accounts to not remain logged in when used on a Steam Deck. For now, the only easy solution to this issue is to use [Prism Launcher](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher) instead.

=====================
MCLP is a simple Python script that can generate statistics about a Minecraft server based on it's `server.log` file.

![MCLP in action](http://i.imgur.com/dweVw.png)

## Current Features
 * Calculates total time played for each player.

As you can see, the feature list is pretty slim right now. The good news is I have some:

## Planned Features
 * Generate death counts
 * Calculate total play times based on how long it's been since they first joined the server (balancing old players vs new players, basically)
 * Generate an HTML summary, since the CLI is no fun to work with.
 * Server errors

I'm open to suggestions. If you have an idea for a statistic that could be generated feel free to suggest it in the issue tracker. If you're feeling extra generous, you could always implement a feature on your own and submit a pull request!

## Installation/Usage
I tried to make using MCLP as easy as possible. As long as you have `pip` installed, usage is as simple as:

	pip install mclp
    mclp /path/to/server.log

Then you should see some neat statistics show up!

## License
Minecraft Log Parser is released under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Have fun and make awesome things with it!

## 🎮 What is GDLauncher

GDLauncher is a custom open-source Minecraft launcher written from the ground up in electron/react. Its main goal is to make it easy and enjoyable to manage different Minecraft versions and install `forge/fabric`, bringing the playing and modding experience to the next level!

## ⚡️ Comparison with Twitch Launcher

This is an example of the time that GDLauncher takes to install a modpack in comparison to Twitch. Both tests are running at the same time over a 1Gbps network to ensure that the network doesn't impact the comparison.

- GDLauncher: `52s`
- Twitch Launcher: `145s`

## 📜 History

This project started as a way for me to learn programming and get better at it. I initially developed it in C#.

After a while, I didn't really like the language, so I just started it again from scratch in React and Electron.
It was here that a community started gathering around the project. In the meanwhile, I also found a job where I could learn even more about best practices, data structures, and more.

This is why I decided to rewrite it completely one more time, applying all the knowledge I gained at that time, and that made it possible to implement a lot of really cool features, that were really complicated to code from a technical point of view.

Here you can find the previous versions of the code:

- [Original C# Code](https://www.github.com/gorilla-devs/GDLauncher/tree/csharp_legacy_launcher)
- [First React Version](https://www.github.com/gorilla-devs/GDLauncher/tree/GDLauncher_old)

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A proxy to wait out 2b2t.org's way too long queue.  
Please Note that because of security reasons this tool doesn't auto-update without a plug-in (check out the addons section)! Also 2b2w does not show ETA from 2b2t.  
The ETA is calculated based on position in the queue. This results in better ETA most of the time.

### Built With

- node.js
- npm
- HTML

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

# Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites

Please obtain all required items

- A discord bot (optional) ([detailed instructions](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html))

## Installation
   
### Video installation

Click the picture or link bellow to watch!   
[![Click Me To Watch!](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3kCKnwuiHak/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3kCKnwuiHak)
  
   
https://youtu.be/3kCKnwuiHak

### Quick Install (64-bit Systems)

1. Read the code to ensure I'm not stealing your credentials. I'm not, but you shouldn't take my word for it. If you don't know how to read it, downloading stuff off the internet and giving it your password is probably a bad idea anyway.
2. Download the executable [here](https://github.com/themoonisacheese/2bored2wait/releases/latest)
3. (Optional) Take a look at the [Configs](#configuration)! 

### Manual Install (32-bit systems, and fallback for quick install):

1. Download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or above and [git](https://git-scm.com). You need git even if you download the repository as zip because it is to install the dependencies via npm.
2. Open a terminal then clone this repo then cd into folder:

```sh
 git clone https://github.com/themoonisacheese/2bored2wait
 cd 2bored2wait
```

3. Run ```yarn``` to install the required libraries
4. Start the program with ````yarn start````.

### Docker

1. Read the code to ensure I'm not stealing your credentials. I'm not, but you shouldn't take my word for it. If you don't know how to read it, downloading stuff off the internet and giving it your password is probably a bad idea anyway.
2. `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 25565:25565 -e NODE_CONFIG='{""username"": ""account email"", ""accountType"": ""mojang or microsoft"", ""mcPassword"": ""your password"", ""BotToken"": ""your discord bot token""}' 2bored2wait/2bored2wait:latest`. The docker image is automatically up to date after each push to this repo. Docker images are available for `amd64` and `arm64` among other platforms.
3. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080
4. Press the ""Start queuing"" button. The queue position indicator auto-updates, but sometimes it takes a while to start counting (like 1 min).
5. Once the queue reaches a low number, connect to the Minecraft server at address `localhost`.
6. After you log off, click the ""stop queuing"" button. This is really important, as you will not actually disconnect from 2b2t until you do that.

If you want to change the configuration or you don't want your credentials in the bash history you will have to mount config/local.json manually.

# Configuration

- You can change all credentials and whether you want update messages by simply editing the values in local.json or deleting that file.
- For the quick install, configs are located: 
   - gnu+linux/macos: $HOME/.config/2bored2wait/
   - windows: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\2bored2wait\Config\ 


# How to use

1. Read the code to ensure I'm not stealing your credentials. I'm not, but you shouldn't take my word for it. If you don't know how to read it, downloading stuff off the internet and giving it your password is probably a bad idea anyway.
2. Run `npm start`
3. It will now ask for your Minecraft email and password (or permission to use saved launcher data instead). If you want update messages then you need to type Y otherwise N. If you are using the discord bot you need to add your token. Then answer Y or N if you want to save your Minecraft credentials. If you answer N you will need to re-enter your Minecraft login information into the console each time you start the program.
4. Refer to Commands on how to use 2b2w from the console. Otherwise keep on reading for the web interface.
5. Now open a browser and navigate to http://localhost: your web port here (default 8080).
6. Press the ""Start queuing"" button. The queue position indicator auto-updates, but sometimes it takes a while to start counting (like 1 min).
7. Once the queue reaches a low number, connect to the Minecraft server at address `localhost`.
8. After you log off, click the ""stop queuing"" button. This is really important, as you will not actually disconnect from 2b2t until you do that.

## Commands

All commands can be used through discord or simply typed in the console window.

- Please note that the time zone for the calculations is based off your computer's time!

- Here are some basic commands:
   - `start` will start the queue. It takes between 15-30 seconds for the bot to update with the queue position.
      - `start 14:00` will start at 2pm.
   - `play 8:00` will try to calculate the right time to join so you can play at 8:00
   - `update` will send an update to the current channel with your position and ETA.
   - `stop` will stop the queue.
- Type `help` for a full ist of commands

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap and known issues

See the [open issues](https://github.com/themoonisacheese/2bored2wait/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

- Starting the queue will revoke your Minecraft token. this means that you will not be able to join normal Minecraft servers until you restart the game
- If you connect after the queue is finished or reconnect the proxy will send cached data. Otherwise you would fly in an empty world. However not all data will be resend. You can move out of render distance (I find going through a nether portal works best) and return to fix this issue. Sometimes the client renders a cached chunk with a blank texture.

### How to make a bug report

Try updating 2bored2wait, run `npm update` (if you are using the source code), and update your system.

• Give info in bug reports such as....

- Output of `npm list` (if you are using the source code).
- Version of program.
- Other error messages. 

Make a bug report [here](https://github.com/themoonisacheese/2bored2wait/issues). Feel free to ask questions or add feature requests as well.

## Addons
- [Auto-Update](https://github.com/KozmikCode/2b2t-auto-update) Allows you to have auto updates!

[![CI](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockProtocol/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockProtocol/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An implementation of the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition protocol in PHP

This library implements all of the packets in the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition protocol, as well as a few extra things needed to support them.
However, at the time of writing, it does _not_ include the following:
- Anything related to JWT handling/verification
- Anything related to encryption
- Anything related to compression

## Decoding packets
Assuming you've decrypted and decompressed a Minecraft packet successfully, you're next going to want to decode it.
With this library, that's currently done using `PacketBatch`, like so:

```php
$batch = new PacketBatch($payload);
foreach($batch->getPackets($packetPool, $protocolContext, $maxPackets) as [$packetObject, $packetPayload]){
  if($packetObject !== null){
    $packetObject->decode(PacketSerializer::decoder($packetPayload, 0, $protocolContext));
    var_dump($packetObject); //tada
  }else{
    var_dump(""Got unknown packet"", $packetPayload);
  }
}
```

## Encoding packets
This is easy:

```php
/** @var Packet[] $packets */
$batch = PacketBatch::fromPackets($protocolContext, ...$packets);
$batchPayload = $batch->getBuffer();
```

## Footnotes
This library is a little rough around the edges, since it's only ever been intended for PocketMine-MP usage. It's only recently that this mess has been separated from the core to allow it to be used by other things.
This means that API changes might be in order, and your feedback would be nice to drive them.
If you want to improve BedrockProtocol, please open issues with suggestions, or better, make pull requests.

800,thedudeguy/PHP-Minecraft-Query,PHP,"PHP-Minecraft-Query
===================

A simple PHP class to connect to a minecraft server and get data about the server using the Query Protocol.

To connect to a server, Query must be activated on the minecraft server by setting `enable-query=true` in the server's server.properties.

This script connects to the server over UDP.

## Examples

### As a Regular PHP Library:
```php
require_once('query.php');

$server = new Query('some.minecraftserver.com');
//or new Query('some.minecraftserver.com', $port, $timeout);

if ($server->connect())
{
  $info = $server->get_info();
  print_r($info);
}

```

### As a CodeIgniter Library:
```php
$settings = array(
  'host' => 'some.minecraftserver.com', //required
  'port' => 25565,  //optional
  'timeout' = 3,    //optional
);
$this->load->library('query', $settings);

$this->query->connect();

if ($this->query->is_connected()) {
  $info = $this->query->get_info();
  print_r($info);
}
```

### get_info() result
Result is an array: here is the dump:
```
Array

    [hostname] => Server MOTD
    [gametype] => SMP
    [game_id] => MINECRAFT

## About BentoBox

### Description

BentoBox is a powerful Bukkit library plugin that provides core features for island-style games like SkyBlock, AcidIsland, SkyGrid and others. 
These games are added to it via its **unique Addon system**. Further, non-game addons can provide features across games, such as challenges or warps. This enables admins to mix and match games and features to customize their server. It also enables the same code to be run 
across games, reducing bugs and speeding updates across all games. For coders, 
BentoBox has a **powerful API** allows for quick and easy development of these addons and simplifies complex aspects such as island protection, GUIs, and team management.

BentoBox is **[free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and open-source software** so join us to make this platform grow, become even more powerful and popular! Admins can pay to support BentoBox and Addons via donations and sponsorship.   

Start now to create the server you've dreamed of!

## Addons
These are some popular Gamemodes:
* [**AcidIsland**](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/AcidIsland): You are marooned in a sea of acid!
* [**AOneBlock**](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/AOneBlock): Start to play with only 1 magical block.
* [**Boxed**](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/Boxed): A game mode where you are boxed into a tiny space that only expands by completing advancements.
* [**BSkyBlock**](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/BSkyBlock): The successor to the popular ASkyBlock.
* [**CaveBlock**](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/CaveBlock): Try to live underground!
* [**SkyGrid**](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/SkyGrid): Survive in world made up of scattered blocks - what an adventure!

All official Addons are listed here:

### History

[tastybento](https://github.com/tastybento) created ASkyBlock and AcidIsland that shared the same codebase. These plugins became very popular but became hard to maintain.
[Poslovitch](https://github.com/Poslovitch) was running a Skyblock server before starting to contribute regularly to ASkyBlock's codebase. He proposed the idea of completely rewriting ASkyBlock
to make it easier to maintain and richer in features. In May 2017, this became the *BSkyBlock* project. As development progressed it became clear that a lot of the new core features could be used by other
island-style games and so that core functionality was split off and renamed *BentoBox* and the addon system was created. The addons for BSkyBlock and AcidIsland became very simple to develop and much smaller. 
The community started to grow and we added new game modes like SkyGrid and CaveBlock by BONNe. BONNe also took over maintenance of Challenges and Biomes and contributed to other addons.  

In December 2019, Poslovitch launched the BentoBox collection on SpigotMC and the story continues!

"
806,enebo/Purugin,Ruby,"# Purugin - Ruby Plugins for Minecraft + Bukkit

Purugin is a plugin framework which sites on top of Bukkit that allows you to
write plugins in a Ruby syntax.

Once you copy Purugin.jar into your plugins directory you only need to drop
.rb files into your plugins directory.  If they contain code which includes
Purugin::Plugin, then they will load and get registered as Bukkit plugins.

## Example

Here is a plugin which gets registered as a plugin in Bukkit which tells
every use in the players world when a player joins or quits the world:

```ruby
#--------- examples/player_joined_full_class.rb ----------
class PlayerJoinedPlugin
  include Purugin::Plugin, Purugin::Colors
  description 'PlayerJoined', 0.1
  
  def on_enable
    # Tell everyone in players world that they have joined
    event(:player_join) do |e|
      e.player.world.players.each do |p| 
        p.msg red(""Player #{e.player.name} has joined"")
      end
    end

    # Tell everyone in players world that they have quit
    event(:player_quit) do |e|
      e.player.world.players.each do |p| 
        p.msg red(""Player #{e.player.name} has quit"")
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Plugin Dependencies

Plugins can depend on other plugins.  There are multiple ways of accessing 
dependent plugins.  The first is to declare your plugin dependencies at the top
of your Purugin:

```ruby
    class PortsPlugin
      include Purugin::Plugin, Purugin::Colors
      description 'Ports', 0.3
      required :LocsPlus, :include => :CoordinateEncoding
      #...
    end
```

This example shows that the 'Ports' plugin requires (via 'required' method) 
 the 'LocsPlus' plugin and that it should include the 'CoordinateEncoding' module from the 'LocsPlus' plugin.

You can specify optional dependencies via the optional declaration:

```ruby
    optional :Permissions
```

As a side-effect both required and optional will define a method by the same 
name as plugin being referenced (Note: This may change since plugin names may 
not conform to sane Ruby-naming and some people don't like methods like 
'Permissions()').

A second way to get a live reference to a plugin is to ask the plugin manager:

```ruby
    plugin_manager['Permissions']
```

This has the advantage that a plugin can be named anything and you will still 
be able to reference it.

## Running

https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/
https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/

To run Purugin, you just copy Purugin.jar into your plugins directory like any 
other minecraft plugin.  Once running you can write Purugins and copy 
those .rb files into your plugins directory.  Simple!  

bin/run.sh and bin/run.bat are provided with defaults that I use and it also sets a local GEM_HOME:

```text
GEM_HOME=./gems java -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -jar craftbukkit.jar
```
## Building Purugin locally

1. Install maven 3
2. Invoke: `mvn clean package`

807,cranstonide/linux-minecraft-scripts,Shell,"Linux Minecraft Scripts
=======================

***

:bangbang: **Notice: I've stopped actively working on these scripts and began developing [a Rakefile based system](https://github.com/cranstonide/minecraft-rakefile) instead.** :bangbang:

***

Scripts to aid in the hosting of vanilla* [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net) servers on a Linux enviornment.

Feel free to clone this repository into your server enviornment to add some much needed funciionality.

Setting up Enviornment
----------------------
In order to use these scripts, you'll just have to clone the repository. Make sure you have `git`, `screen`, and `java` installed.

    git clone https://github.com/cranstonide/linux-minecraft-scripts

Don't forget to edit the `mc-config.cfg` to meet your setup. The scripts won't work correctly if you don't customize the config file first.

Starting the Server
-------------------
Most of the scripts in this repo require Minecraft to run inside a GNU screen. This can be done using the `mc-start.sh` script as follows:

    ./mc-start.sh

Stopping the Server
-------------------
You can shut down the server (and give people a heads up) using the provided script.

    ./mc-stop.sh

Accessing the Console
---------------------
If you need to reach the Minecraft console, you may do so by running the following command.

    screen -r minecraft

Notes
-----
These scripts are to help manage a [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net) server running on Linux. They are bash scripts; so they won't run on your Windows installation without some major refactoring. The installation also heavily relies on a working installation of [GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/).

*These scripts have not been tested with any third party servers. They may work, but your milage may vary.*

TODO
----
These are some features I may add eventually.
- Administrative interface (for starting and stopping)
- Add submodules for rendering and log viewers.

# MagiBridge, by Eufranio
MagiBridge is a Sponge plugin that creates a Discord <-> Minecraft chat bridge, forwarding messages from/to both sides, through JDA and supported chat plugins.

## How to MagiBridge:
1) Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and create a new App
2) Scroll down and click on ""Create a Bot User""
3) Go to the **Bot** section, reveal the Token and copy-paste it into the bot-token=""..."" field in the `config/magibridge/MagiBridge.conf` file
4) **In the Privileged Gateway Intents section, make sure to ENABLE the SERVER MEMBERS INTENT. Without it, MagiBridge cannot track the discord users.
5) Create a new Discord Server.  It will have a #general channel.  You can create other channels.
6) Add the bot to your server: Find the Client ID of the new App, and replace the CLIENTID in the following link with your bot's client ID in
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENTID&scope=bot (for example, if you bot's Client ID is 168682538028630017, your link would be https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=168682538028630017&scope=bot), select Your Server from the drop-down menu, and Authorize. You must have the Manage Server permission to add a bot to a server!
7) On _Server Settings_, in _Roles_, create a _New Role_ named e.g. ""bot"", give it the _Manage Channels_ permission, and in _Members_ [grant your Bot that role](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707).
8) [Enable Discord Developer Mode](https://discordia.me/developer-mode) and [copy-paste the channel ID you want to use](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) into the main-discord-channel="" ""

8) Make sure you have the compatibility features enabled and properly configured in `MagiBridge.conf` for Nucleus, UltimateChat and Boop if you're using them
9) Configure the rest of the stuff you want and reload the plugin/start the server
10) Profit

## Features:
* Link Nucleus/UltimateChat channels to discord channels (sends messages from the in-game chat to discord and vice versa)
* Link as many UltimateChat channels you want
* Sends server start/stop messages to Discord
* Respects Nucleus' staff channel (forward chat from it only to the discord staff channel and vice versa)
* Run console commands from Discord (by default, !cmd <command>), if you have the defined Discord role
* Sends join/quit messages to Discord
* Includes a player count command (by default, !online). It will show you a nice list of players online
* Per-channel message format override: you can set different message templates for every channel you want
* Adds the **/mb <channel> <message>** that sends a raw message to a specific channel using the bot. Admin only! (the permission is magibridge.admin.broadcast)
* Respects the channels the bot is listening for the !online and console commands
* Updates the channel topic with info like the server TPS, online player count, uptime and etc every second
* Sends achievement get messages to Discord
* Sends death messages to Discord
* Supports getting the player's prefix in messages
* Supports Webhooks: if enabled, instead a bot sending the messages, webhooks will. They will have the player's skin and name. Try it out!
* AFK messages: send messages on AFK events to Discord!

**Note**: almost all messages and/or commands are completely translatable/modifiables. You can change them by modifying the message string of the message in the config!

### Permissions
* `magibridge.silentjoin` - doesn't trigger a join message when the player joins the server
* `magibridge.silentquit` - doesn't trigger a quit message when the player leaves the server
* `magibridge.everyone` - allow the player to use @everyone on messages sent to Discord
* `magibridge.whois` - allows the use of `/whois <player>` command to check the Discord username of a linked player via MBDiscordLink
* `magibridge.admin.broadcast` - allows the use of the `/mb <channel> <message>` command to send messages to Discord
* `magibridge.chat` (granted by default) - allows messages from the player to be sent to Discord
* `magibridge.mention` (granted by default) - allows players to mention discord users

### Supported plugins:
[UltimateChat, from FabioZumbi12](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/thought-balloon-ultimatechat-v-1-7-0-api-5-6), [Nucleus, from dualspiral](https://ore.spongepowered.org/Nucleus/Nucleus)

809,gaucho-matrero/altoclef,Java,"# altoclef
Plays block game.

Powered by Baritone.

A client side bot that can accomplish any Minecraft task that is relatively simple and can be split into smaller tasks. ""Relatively Simple"" is a vague term, so check the list of current capabilities to see examples.

Became [the first bot to beat Minecraft fully autonomously](https://youtu.be/baAa6s8tahA) on May 24, 2021.

**Join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JdFP4Kqdqc)** for discussions/updates/goofs & gaffs

## How it works

Take a look at this [Guide from the wiki](https://github.com/gaucho-matrero/altoclef/wiki/1:-Documentation:-Big-Picture) or this [Video explanation](https://youtu.be/q5OmcinQ2ck?t=387)

## Current capabilities, Examples:
- Obtain 400+ Items from a fresh survival world, like diamond armor, cake, and nether brick stairs
- Dodge mob projectiles and force field mobs away while accomplishing arbitrary tasks
- Collect + smelt food from animals, hay, & crops
- Receive commands from chat whispers via /msg. Whitelist + Blacklist configurable (hereby dubbed the Butler System). Here's a [Butler system demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1axVYYMJ5VjmVHaWlCifFHTwiXlFssOUc/view?usp=sharing)
- Simple config file that can be reloaded via command (check .minecraft directory)
- Beat the entire game on its own (no user input.)
- Print the entire bee movie script with signs in a straight line, automatically collecting signs + bridging materials along the way.
- Become the terminator: Run away from players while unarmed, gather diamond gear in secret, then return and wreak havoc.

## Download

**Note:** After installing, please move/delete your old baritone configurations if you have any. Preexisting baritone configurations will interfere with altoclef and introduce bugs. This will be fixed in the future.

### Nightly Release (Recommended) (has the latest bug fixes)

Start by downloading [the Latest Long Term Release](https://github.com/gaucho-matrero/altoclef/releases), then [Download the Nightly](https://nightly.link/gaucho-matrero/altoclef/workflows/gradle/main/Artifacts.zip) & replace `altoclef-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

If the Nightly Link doesn't work, check the latest [Build Action](https://github.com/gaucho-matrero/altoclef/actions) that succeeded and download `Artifacts.zip` (you must be signed into GitHub). Replace your existing `altoclef-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` with the one found in `Artifacts.zip`

Then, copy `altoclef-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` from `Artifacts.zip` to `./mods`.

Then, copy the `baritone-unoptimized-fabric-1.XX.X.jar` from the long term release zip file to `./mods`

### Long Term Release

[Check releases](https://github.com/gaucho-matrero/altoclef/releases). Note you will need to copy over both jar files for the mod to work.

### Meloweh's Extra Features Release (Unofficial)

Has some schematic support, command macros and a few utility features. Will eventually be merged, but if you can try it out now if you'd like:

- [AltoClef jar](https://github.com/Meloweh/altoclef/releases)
- [Baritone jar](https://github.com/Meloweh/baritone/releases)

### Versions

This is a **fabric only** mod, currently only available for **Minecraft 1.18**.

The index includes clients for [Fabric](#fabric) and [Forge](#forge) (as well as [Standalone](#standalone) mods). It is alphabetically sorted by mod name and categorized by the modloader.

<details>
<summary><strong>Modloaders explained</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

A modloader is exactly what it sounds like: it loads mods, hence ""mod loader"". These loaders make it easy for developers to write mods and even easier for players to install mods.

| Modloader | Description | Website |
| :-------: | ----------- | :-----: |
| Fabric | Fabric is a lightweight, experimental modding toolchain for Minecraft. Much newer than Forge. | [Fabric] |
| Forge | Arguably the most popular modding API for Minecraft. Most older (around MC 1.12) mods are written using Forge. Forge does have support for newer MC versions, but developers tend to switch to Fabric for newer MC. | [Forge] |
| Standalone | This is a more primitive method of modding where devs don't use a dedicated modloader, and rather modify the game directly. A popular example of this style is [Optifine], which can be loaded into Minecraft without setting up any other modloaders. | *N/A* |

**Please note:** Forge and Fabric are **not** designed to work alongside eachother. You are free to try it, but don't be surprised if it doesn't work and no one helps you.

# Disposable Minecraft Servers

Vagrant is a virtualization service for creating disposable dev environments. Now the two of them are together for running easy, shareable minecraft servers.


![Minecraft Vagrant](https://i.imgur.com/g6mFnta.png?1 ""Minecraft running inside Vagrant"")

## What does this do
You can run ```vagrant up``` on your windows, linux, or mac machine and have a minecraft server running in a compartmentalized virtual server. When you run ```vagrant destroy``` the virtualize machine is destroyed but your persistent data is kept in ```persistent_data```. You can clone this repo on any mac, windows, or linux machine with Vagrant installed to easily create a minecraft server you and your friends can join.

## Why
Initially I created this vagrant image so I could quickly and easily test mods. Just start the vagrant instance and do whatever you want. If you break something or decide you don't want to use that mod any longer, simply destroy the image and the persistent data and start it again. It will be just like new.

Backing up and restoring your minecraft server very easy, since all of your data -- including the information necessary for running the server -- is contained in just a few files and folders. You can even copy the entire directory over to a new server and run it there.

Lastly, I bet there are parents out there who want to run minecraft servers for their children. This let's you do this easily from just about any platform without having to configure anything.

## Running the server
First install Vagrant if you haven't already done that.

Next clone the repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:stephen-mw/vagrant_minecraft_auto_launch.git
```

Pop into the vagrant server and run ```vagrant up```
```
cd vagrant_minecraft_auto_launch
vagrant up
```

At this point you can run ```vagrant ssh``` to go into the server. You'll be greated with a MOTD with some helpful information:
```
WELCOME TO MINECRAFT!

To stop, start, restart or check the status of the the minecraft server
process, simply run:

  $ service minecraft <stop|start|restart|status>

The runtime logs are available at /opt/minecraft/logs

To change the min or max server memory values, make the change in:

  /etc/init/minecraft.conf

And then restart the server proces.

Status of minecraft server:

minecraft start/running, process 2344

Have fun!
```

### Under the hood
The server will launch an Ubuntu 12.04 image that will download and install everything you need to run minecraft automatically. It will also start the service and take care of logs. Everything related to your server will be in ```persistent_data``` and that folder will survive the destruction and creation of these vagrant instances.

After the installation completes, you and others will be able to connect to your server at your _host's_ ip address. That means if you launch the vagrant instance on a laptop that has the ip address of 192.168.0.101, then you can connect to the server at the same address (regardless of what your guest ip address is).

The instance itself doesn't need to be destroyed between runs. You can also halt it. Either way, when you bring it back online it should be running the server.

819,PaperMC/Paperclip,Java,"Paperclip
=========
A binary patch distribution system for Paper.

Paperclip is the launcher for the Paper Minecraft server. It uses a [bsdiff](http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/) patch
between the vanilla Minecraft server and the modified Paper server to generate the Paper Minecraft server immediately
upon first run. Once the Paper server is generated it loads the patched jar into Paperclip's own class loader, and runs
the main class.

This avoids the legal problems of the GPL's linking clause.

The patching overhead is avoided if a valid patched jar is found in the cache directory.
It checks via sha256 so any modification to those jars (or updated launcher) will cause a repatch.

Building
--------

Building Paperclip creates a runnable jar, but the jar will not contain the Paperclip config file or patch data. This
project consists simply of the launcher itself, the [paperweight Gradle plugin](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight)
generates the patch and config file and inserts it into the jar provided by this project, creating a working runnable jar.

821,Sandertv/mcwss,Go,"# mcwss
A documentation and implementation of the Minecraft Bedrock Edition websocket protocol.

## Minecraft Websockets
Minecraft has websocket connection commands that may be used to connect to a websocket server. These commands are `/connect` and `/wsserver`.
Both these commands have the same effect. Once connected to a websocket, the connection will last until the server closes it or until the
player completely exits the game. The connection will last when a player merely leaves a world, and will thus last when joining a server.
Websockets in Minecraft can be used for simple command communication between a player and a server. Additionally, the server can choose to
listen for certain events sent by the client and act upon receiving them.

In order to be able to execute the `/connect` and `/wsserver` commands, cheats must be enabled. This means that connecting on third party
servers is not possible, and only on the dedicated server when cheats are enabled. It is possible to connect on a singleplayer world and
join a server after that, but commands executed by the websocket server will not work. Events will still be sent by the client however.

In the settings tab, there is also a setting that enables/disables encrypted websockets. mcwss implements encryption between websockets, 
so changing this setting will not have an effect on the behaviour of mcwss.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
mcwss is a Go library. To use it, Go must be installed. The library may be downloaded using `go get github.com/sandertv/mcwss`.

### Usage
```go
package main

import (
	""github.com/sandertv/mcwss""
)

func main() {
    // Create a new server using the default configuration. To use specific configuration, pass a *wss.Config{} in here.
    server := mcwss.NewServer(nil)
    
    server.OnConnection(func(player *mcwss.Player){
      // Called when a player connects to the server.
    })
    server.OnDisconnection(func(player *mcwss.Player){
      // Called when a player disconnects from the server.
    })
    // Run the server. (blocking)
    server.Run()
}
```
The server may now be connected to by joining a singleplayer game and executing the command `/connect localhost:8000/ws`.

## FAQ

Q: What phases are there?

A: There are 11 phases: Plains, Underground, Winter, Ocean, Jungle, Swamp, Dungeon, Desert, The Nether, Plenty, Desolation, and The End. Each phase features a set of blocks, items, and mobs appropriate for the setting.

Q: How many blocks are there in the 11 phases?

A: There are currently 11 thousand blocks!

Q: What happens after the last phase?

A: The phases repeat.

Q: Why do I keep falling and dying!

A: There are tricks to surviving, but it might be difficult! You need to build defenses.

Q: I can't catch the blocks when I mine them! How do I do that?

A: Yep. It's tough. You can't catch them all, but it *is* an infinite block!

Q: Why do certain blocks spawn more frequently than others?

A: They just do! You can set the relative probability in the config files in the phases folder.

Q. How do I know which is the magic block?

A. Hit it and it will give out green particles.

Q. My magic block is no longer there! How do I get another one?

A. You will have to place a block there. Worse case, kill yourself and one will be generated.

Q. My magic block is liquid! How can I mine it?

A. Use a bucket.

Q: Which mobs can spawn?

A: Each phase has a different set of mobs that can spawn. Be careful because they may push you off! If you listen carefully, you may hear hostile mobs coming.

Q. I have no chance to react to hostile mobs spawning!

A. Be prepared. Listen carefully when you mine a block and you will hear hostile mobs coming before they spawn. If you are in a hostile phase, then expect mobs and build defenses to protect yourself. You can mine a block from quite far away.

Q. When mobs spawn, my defenses are destroyed! Why?

A. Mobs make space to spawn. If there's anything in the way, it'll be broken and dropped. You'll have to build accordingly.

Q: Do chests spawn?

A: Yes. Chests spawn with random items in them from the current phase. There are common, uncommon, rare and epic chests. Chests with sparkles are good.

Q: Is it possible to reach the Nether or End in this map?

A: The vanilla Nether exists by default but there is no End world. 

Q: What is the end goal?

A: It's whatever you want it to be! 

## Installation

0. Install BentoBox and run it on the server at least once to create its data folders.
1. Place this jar in the addons folder of the BentoBox plugin.
2. Restart the server.
3. The addon will create worlds and a data folder and inside the folder will be a config.yml and config files in phases folder.
4. Stop the server.
5. Edit config.yml and the .yml config files how you want.
6. Delete any worlds that were created by default if you made changes that would affect them.
7. Restart the server.

## Phase config files

The config files to make the phases are in the phases folder.

There are two files per phase - a file that contains the blocks and mobs, and a file that contains the chests.

The first number of any file is how many blocks need to be mined to reach that phase. This is the phase's key number.
Each phase also has a name, a biome and the following sections:

- blocks
- mobs

In the chests file, it just has the phase number and a chests section.


### blocks

The blocks section list Bukkit Materials followed by a relative probability. All the probability values are added up for the whole phase and the chance of the block being placed is the relative probability divided by the total of all the probabilities.

### mobs

The mob section list mobs that can spawn and their relative probability along with blocks. You can only list entities that are alive and can spawn in this list.

### chests

If CHEST is listed in the blocks section, then it will be randomly filled according to this section. You can define as many chests as you like. The first number is a unique chest number. Then follows the chest contents that includes the slot number and the item stack contents. Finally there is the chest's rarity, which can be COMMON, UNCOMMON, RARE or EPIC. The best way to set chests is to do it in game. Fill a chest with the contents you want and then while looking at it enter the command `/oba setchest <phase> <rarity>` where <phase> is the name of the phase and rarity is the rarity. Use Tab Complete to see the options. The chest will be automatically added to the oneblocks.yml file and be ready to use. Deleting chests must be done by editing the oneblocks.yml file for now and reloading the addon.

Be very careful when editing the chest items and check that the material is a true Bukkit material and spelled correctly.

### Other Add-ons

OneBlock is an add-on that uses the BentoBox API. Here are some other ones that you may be interested in:

* [**Addons**](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/BentoBox/blob/develop/ADDON.md)

You can add all the usual addons to OneBlock, like Challeges, Likes, Level, Warps, etc. but it is not required.

# Minecraft Script Dokumentation
> Update 0.2.1: [Alle Änderungen](https://github.com/Stevertus/mcscript/releases)

Minecraft Script ist eine Programmiersprache für Entwickler der mcfunctions, sowie für die Minecraft Map und Package Erschaffer. Die .mcscript Dateien werden dabei zu mcfunction compiled und generiert. Dies bietet dem Entwickler erweiterte Möglichkeiten, wie zum Beispiel Modals, Loops, Variablen, Konstanten und Command-Wrapping.

Besuche die offizielle Website für weitere Informationen, Guides und Videos: https://mcscript.stevertus.com/de

<a id=""install""></a>
## 1) Installation

Der Compiler wird auch als [Node.js/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Package angeboten, das lokal auf dem PC installiert wird und viele Features mehr hat: als die Online-Version hat.  
z.B: Alle Dateien in einem Ordner gleichzeitig compilen, direkter Output in neuen Dateien, auf Dateiänderungen ""watchen"", uvm.
<a id=""install-nodejs""></a>
### 1.1 Installation von Node.js

Für die Installation wird die Node.js Umgebung und der Node Package Manager benötigt.

Diese installiert man am besten über den Installer: [nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
Den einfach ausführen und installieren lassen.
<a id=""install-mcscript""></a>
### 1.2 Installation von Minecraft Script

Öffne nun die Konsole deines PCs (Am besten über Suche unter CMD zu erreichen).

Hier muss nun dieser Command eingegeben werden:
> ```npm install -g mcscript```  

Bei einer erfolgreichen Antwort hast du alles richtig gemacht und kannst durchstarten.
<a id=""cli""></a>
##  2) CLI Commands


Das Tool kannst du nun anwenden, indem du die Command Line in deinen Datapacks Ordner startest  
(über Shift + Rechtsklick auf Ordner -> Eingabeaufforderung hier öffnen)  
Nun kannst du die Kommandos benutzen:
<a id=""cli-new""></a>
### 2.1 mcscript new

Dieser Command generiert dir ein vorgefertigtes Datapack mit allen basic Dateien und einem Scripts-Ordner. Als Argument muss die Id des Packs angegeben werden!
<a id=""cli-compile""></a>
### 2.2 mcscript compile

Dieser Command wandelt alle .mcscript Dateien in .mcfunction Format um. Was in den mcscript Dateien möglich ist, kannst du hier nachlesen.  
In der Konsole werden alle generierten Dateien angezeigt oder ein Fehler ausgeworfen, falls etwas nicht korrekt war.

Alternativ kannst mit `mcscript compile *filepath*` einen speziellen Pfad oder spezielle Datei angeben.
Mit der zusätzlichen `-fullErr` flag können ganze Fehler mit code Referenzen angezeigt werden.
<a id=""cli-watch""></a>
### 2.3 mcscript watch

Hiermit wird dein Code automatisch compiled, wenn du irgendwelche Änderungen machst (speicherst). So musst du nicht bei jeder Änderung den obigen Command eingeben.

Auch hier kann ein Pfad angegeben und -fullErr verwendet werden.
<a id=""cli-add""></a>
### 2.4 mcscript add [url or package]
Dieser Conmmand kann ein datapack zu deiner Welt hinzufügen.
Als Argument kann entweder eine Url direkt zur Datei oder der Name einer mcScript Extension genutzt werden.

Eine Liste aller McScript Extensions kann bekommen werden mit `mcscript add`

<a id=""cli-modals""></a>
### 2.4 Dev: mcscript modals

!!Dieser Command ist nur für Entwicker gedacht, die ihre Modals in den Compiler einbauen wollen.  
Es muss eine Datei angegeben werden und die Modals aus dieser Datei werden dann in eine Konfigurationsdatei geschrieben.
<a id=""files""></a>
## 3) File system
### 3.1 File setup
In einem Minecraft Datapack können alle Datein in ein scripts Ordner gepackt werden, um dann in `/functions` den Output zu generieren.
Es werden immer Dateien mit gleichem Namen, wie ihr Root generiert.

Ein benutzerdefinierter Name kann mit `#file: *name*` gesetzt werden.  
Bitte ohne `.mcfunction`!!

Statt des Namen kann auch gleich ein ganzer Pfad, an dem die neue Datei sein soll, angegeben werden:

*   `#file: C:/test/neu`
*   `#file: ./neu` (Im gleichen Ordner)
*   `#file: ./unterordner/neu`
*   `#file: ../neu` (Ein Ordner dadrüber)
*   `#file: ../unterordner/neu`

Es können auch mehrere Dateien spezifiziert werden:

    #file: neu
    //commands hier
    #file: zwei
    //Commands für zwei hier

Auch sehr gut mit [for-loops](#loops) kombinierbar:

    #file: neu
    //commands hier
    for(1,5){
    	#file: test$(i)
    	//Commands für jede Datei hier
    }
<a id=""extend""></a>
### 3.2 Dateien erweitern
Eine bereits bestehende Datei, vorher mit `#file:`, kann nun auch aus anderen Dateien erweitert werden und neuer Code einfach hinten drangehängt werden:
```
#extend: ./test
/commands kommen hier.
```
<a id=""global""></a>
### 3.3 Globale Dateien
[Variablen](#vars), [Konstanten](#consts) und [Modals](#modals) werden für jede Datei seperat gespeichert.
Jetzt kann man eine globale Datei mit der Endung `.gl.mcscript` erstellen. Der Compiler erkennt diese automatisch und verwendet die deklarierten Objekte auch in anderen Dateien.
So kann man die Modals zum Beispiel in eine eigende Datei schreiben.
<a id=""syntax""></a>
##  Minecraft Script Syntax


Der Code wird in Dateien mit der Endung .mcscript geschrieben. Es wird ein Code-Editor(IDE) empfohlen, um die Dateien zu verwalten und den Syntax farbig zu markieren. [Mehr hier](#ide)

Anders als bei mcfunction wird jeder Command mit einem ""/"" oder ""run: "" injektiert.

Kommentare werden mit ""//"" angekündigt, falls Kommentare auch in der neuen Datei auftauchen sollen mit ""#""
Ein Kommentar über mehrere Zeilen muss mit
```
*/
angegeben werden
/*
```

Leerzeilen und Zeilensprünge werden nicht beachtet.  
Falls eine Leerzeile aus Struktur in der mcfunction gewünscht ist,drücke dies mit einem # ohne Kommentar aus.  
Zwei Leerzeilen können mit ""##"" erreicht werden.
<a id=""groups""></a>

### 4.1 Command Gruppen / Wrapping
> ```[subcommand]([argument]){  [wrapped actions]   }```

""as, at, positioned,align,dimension,rotated,anchored"" können zusammengefasst werden:


    as(@a){	 
    	/commands 	=> /execute positioned ~ ~ ~ run command
    }		 


In den Klammern muss das jeweilige Argument als String, sprich "" "" oder ' ' stehen!
Auch ist der eigende `asat()` möglich
```
asat(@s){
    /commands => execute as @s at @s run commands
}
```
""Gruppen können auch aufgelistet werden:


    as(@p), at(@s), positioned('~ ~1 ~'){
    	/say command
    }
    ==> /execute as @p at @s positioned ~ ~-1 ~ run say command

    // also with if
    as(@p), at(@s), positioned('~ ~1 ~'), if(@s[tag=mytag]){
    	/say command
    }
    ==> /execute as @p at @s positioned ~ ~-1 ~ if entity @s[tag=mytag] run say command
<a id=""functions""></a>
### 4.2 Funktionen
 ```
[run] function ""name|path"" {
	/commands
}
```
> run optional
> ein Pfad sollte als String angegeben werden
> ein nur aus Buchstaben bestehender name auch ohne """"

Eine Funktion generiert eine weitere mcfunction mit den angegebenen Namen oder Pfad. Mit dem run keyword kann eine Funktion auch direkt ausgeführt werden.
Dies ist eine alternative zu einer wesentlich komplizierteren Variante mit `#file:`.
Bsp:
```
run function test {
	/say function
}
/say not function
=
/function prj:test
/say not function

#file: ./test
/say function
```
<a id=""vars""></a>
### 4.3 Variablen
Wie jede Programmiersprache hat auch Minecraft Script Variablen. Sie müssen wiefolgt initialisiert werden:
`var test`
Der Variablen kann ein Wert hinzugewiesen werden:
```
var test = 5
# oder
var test
test = 6
```
Dieser Wert kann beliebig oft wieder verändert werden.

```
var test
test @s = 10
```
So können Werte auch nur speziellen Minecraft Selektoren zugewiesen werden.
Auch mit Spielernamen oder Placeholdern möglich:
```
test Spielername = 10
```
Alle Werte werden in einem scoreboard mit dem Variablennamen gespeichert. Also können die Werte auch ganz standart mäßig verändert und ausgelesen werden:
```
var test
test @s = 10
/scoreboard players get @s test ==> 10
/scoreboard players set @s test 5
# etc
```

Variablen können auch mit anderen zusammen gerechnet und zusammengefügt werden:
```
var test = 10
var neu = 5
# Achtung: Der Einfachkeit halber starte ich immer wieder mit diesen Werten. Das Programm macht es nartürlich anders!

test += 2 ==> 12
test -= 2 ==> 8
```
Etwas gekürzt:
```
test++ ==> test += 1
test-- ==> test -= 1

test += neu ==> 15
test -= neu ==> 5
test *= neu ==> 50
test /= neu ==> 2
test %= neu ==> 0
```
**Command Response in Variable speichern:**
```
var res = run: command
==> execute store result score res res run command
```
Das Ergebnis des command wird in die Variable res geschrieben.
Beispiel mit /data get:
`var varResult = run: data get entity @s Pos[0]`

<a id=""boolean""></a>
### 4.4 Boolean Variablen (Tags)
> `bool [name] [selector](optional) = true|false`

So können Wahrheitswerte deklariert werden.
`bool isCool = true => tag [global] add isCool`
Eine Boolean Variable kann später noch verändert werden:
`isCool = false => tag [global] remove isCool`

Mit [If](#if) testbar:
```
if(isCool){
    /commands => execute if entity [global][tag=isCool] run commands
}
```
<a id=""consts""></a>
### 4.5 Konstanten
Eine andere Art Variable ist die Konstante, so deklariert:
> `const [name] = [value]`

Diese Art kann nicht verändert werden!
Du kannst sie mit `$(var_name)` irgendwo in deinem Code benutzen um lange Strings und wiederholende Phrasen zu vermeiden:
```
const einString = ""Hier könnte sehr viel Schrott stehen.""
const eineNum = 5

/say $(einString)       ==> /say Hier könnte sehr viel Schrott stehen.
var test = $(eineNum)   ==> var test = 5
```
**Replace Konstanten**
Der Wert einer Konstante kann bei der Verwendung noch umgeändert werden. Hierzu ein `.repl()` an die Verwendung anfügen:
> `$(const).repl([suchwert],[replacement])`

Bei unserem Beispiel wollen wir das viel replacen:
```
/say $(einString).repl(""viel"",""sehr viel"") ==> /say Hier könnte sehr sehr viel Schrott stehen.
```
Auch kann hier ein [RegEx](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) eingefügt werden und auch auf diesen im Replacement zugegriffen werden:
`$(const).repl([/regex/],[""$&""])`
<a id=""maps""></a>
#### Maps
Maps sind schlüssel-wert Paare ähnlich wie bei einem Wörterbuch. Wir definieren eine Map mit dem Map-Operator:
```js
const testMap = Map{

}
```
In den Klammern kannst du so viele Paare angeben, wie du magst:
```js
const testMap = Map{
	""key1"":""value"",
	""key2"":""value2""
}
```
Wir können dann auf die Werte so zugreifen:
```js
/say $(testMap).key1

⇒ /say value
```
<a id=""arrays""></a>
#### Arrays
Arrays sind ziemlich ähnlich zu Maps, nur dass wir nicht Paare sondern eine einfache Liste an Werten haben.
```js
const testArr = Array{
	""value"", // index 0
	""value2"" // index 1
}
```
Die Werte können mit dem Index des Elements abgerufen werden:
```js
/say $(testArr).0
⇒ /say value
/say $(testArr).1
⇒ /say value2
```
<a id=""if""></a>
### 4.6 If/Else Statements

If funktioniert ähnlich wie das Command Wrapping:


    if('statement'){
    	/commands 	=> /execute if statement run command
    }		 


Mit einigen extra Features:

*   Vor dem Argument kann ein ""!"" eingefügt werden um dies umzukehren:


        if(!'statement'){
        	/commands 	=> /execute unless statement run command
        }		 


*   Nach dem Schluss kann ein ""else"" angehängt werden:
```
    if('statement'){
    	/commands 	=> /execute if statement run command
    } else {		   /execute unless statement run command2
    	/commands2
    }
```

Hier darauf achten das Argument nicht zu verändern!
```
    if(@s[tag=test]){
    	/tag @s remove test 	
    	} else {		  		
    	/tag @s remove test		
    }
```
Hier werden beide ausgeführt!! Verbessert:
```
    if(@s[tag=test]){
    	/tag @s add testIf
    }
    if(@s[tag=testIf]){
    	/tag @s remove test 	
    	} else {		  		
    	/tag @s remove test		
    }
```

*   auch ""else if"" ist möglich:
```
    if('statement'){
    	/commands 				=> /execute if statement run command
    } else if('statement2') {	   /execute unless statement if statement2 run command2
    	/commands2
    }
```

<a id=""operators""></a>
### 4.7 Logische Operatoren

In Kombination mit Command Gruppen und If-Else-Statements können zusätzlich logische Operatoren benutzt werden:

*   Der Oder-Operator kann bei den Gruppierungen auf zwei Arten benutzt werden:
```
    as(@s||@p){
    	/command 	
    }
    ==> execute as @s run command
        execute at @p run command

    # oder als Liste
    if(@s[tag=entity1],'entity @s[tag=entity2]'){
    # hier gehen beide Varianten ^
    	/command 	
    }
    ==> execute if entity @s[tag=entity1] run command
        execute if entity @s[tag=entity2] @p run command
```

*   Der Und-Operator wird so definiert: (nur für if-statements sinnvoll)
```
    if('entity @s'&&'entity @p'){
    	/command 	
    }
    ==> execute if entity @s if entity @p run command
```
*   Überprüfung von Variablen:
```
var test = 5

# genau gleich
if(test == 5){
    /commands
}

# größer/kleiner gleich
if(test >= 5){
    /commands
}

# größer/kleiner
if(test > 5){
    /commands
}

# auch im Vergleich möglich
if(test > test2){
    /commands
}

# oder mit entity variablen
if(test @s > test2 @a){
    /commands
}
```
<a id=""switch""></a>
### 4.8 Switch-Cases
```
switch([var_name]){
    case <=|<|==|>|>= [other_var]|[number] {
        [actions]
    },
    default(optional) {
        [default actions]
    }
}
```
Switches erleichtern dem Benutzer die vielen If-Bedingungen. Es kann einfach und übersichtlich auf verschiedene Werte von Variablen getestet werden.
bsp:
```
var test = 10
switch(test){
    case > 10 {
        /say var ist über 10
    },
    case < 10 {
        /say var ist unter 10
    },
    default {
        /say nichts traf zu.
    }
}
```
Hier wird also test geprüft auf über 10, wenn das nicht zutrifft auf unter 10 und als standart default ausgegeben.
Auch abkürzbar:
```
var test = 10
switch(test){
    case > 10 run: say var ist über 10
    , case < 10 run: say var ist unter 10
    , default run: say nichts traf zu.
}
```
<a id=""for""></a>
### 4.9 For-Loops
```
for([from],[to],[var_name](optional)){
    [actions]
}
```
Einer der hilfreichsten Features ist der For-Loop. Als Argumente werden ganze Zahlen angenommen.

Von `erstes Argument` bis `zweites Argument` wird optional ausgegeben als `drittes Argument`
```
for(1,5){
	/commands
	# es wird 5x command ausgegeben
}
```
```
for(1,5){
	/say $(i)
	# es wird 5x say mit 1 - 5 ausgegeben
}
```

Mit $(var_name) kann auf den Loopwert zugegriffen werden.

var_name ist normalerweise als ""i"" definiert, kann aber im 3.Argument geändert werden:


    for(1,5,X){
    	/say $(X)
    	# es wird 5x say mit 1 - 5 ausgegeben
    }	 					


Das ist bei 2 dimensionalen Loops sinnvoll:


    for(1,5,i){
    	for(1,2,j){
    		/say $(i).$(j)
    	}
    	# es wird 10x say mit 1.1 - 5.2 ausgegeben
    }
<a id=""raycast""></a>
### 4.10 Raycasting
```
raycast([distance](optional), [block to travel through](optional),entity | block [target](optional) ){
    [actions on hitted block or entity]
},{
    [actions for every flight step]
}
default distance = 100 Blocks
default block = air
default target = any block
```
Raycasting ist eine große Sache in Minecraft 1.13 und bietet viele Möglichkeiten.
Es ist allerdings bisschen schwierig, also warum nicht leichter machen?
Mit Minecraft Script ist das nun sehr sehr einfach:
```
raycast {
    /setblock ~ ~ ~ stone
}
```
Das alleine setzt überall, wo man hinschaut einen Steinblock.
Partikel und Blockbegrenzung auch noch sehr einfach:
```
raycast(10) {
    /setblock ~ ~ ~ stone
}, {
    /particle flame ~ ~ ~
}
```
Jetzt haben wir schöne Effekte und eine maximale Range von 10 Blöcken.
Das zweite optinale Argument gibt die durchlässigen Blöcke an.
```
raycast(10,""air"") {
    /setblock ~ ~ ~ stone
}
```
Das Raycasting geht also nur durch Luft.
Auch kann man die durchlässigen Blöcke negieren und mit einem ""!"" angeben, welche Blöcke nicht durchlässig sind:
```
raycast(10,!""white_wool"") {
    /setblock ~ ~ ~ stone
}
```
Das Raycasting geht also durch alle Blöcke außer weiße Wolle.

Als drittes optionales Argument kann man ein Ziel angeben:
```
raycast(10,""air"",block ""white_wool"") {
    /setblock ~ ~ ~ stone
}
```
Jetzt weiß Mcscript, dass das Ziel ein Block ist und führt den Command nur aus, wenn der Block weiße Wolle ist.
```
raycast(10,""air"",entity @e[type=armor_stand]) {
    /say test
}
```
Mcscript weiß nun, dass das Ziel eine Entity ist und führt den Command als diese aus, wenn sie getroffen wurde.
Also würde der Armor Stand test sagen.
<a id=""while""></a>
### 4.11 while-Loops
Der while-Loop ist so zu definieren:
```
while([cond]){
    /commands
}
```
Die gruppierten Commands werden solange ausgeführt, wie die Bedingung[cond] war ist.
> Wenn die Bedingung zum Start nicht wahr ist, wird die Gruppierung nicht ausgeführt!

Als Bedingung können hier alle Operatoren und Argumente der If-Bedingungen verwendet werden. z.B.
```
var test = 0
while(test < 10){
    /commands hier
    test += 1
}
# ==> Die Commands werden innerhalb eines Ticks 10mal ausgeführt.
```
Bei while-Loops kann auch mit stop und continue gearbeitet werden:
```
var test = 0
while(test < 10){
    test += 1
    if(test == 5){
        continue
        # Wenn test 5 ist werden die restlichen Commands übersprungen
    }
    /commands hier
    if(test >= 9){
        stop
        # Wenn test 9 oder über 9 ist wird die Schleife abgebrochen
    }
}
```
<a id=""dowhile""></a>
### 4.12 do-while-Loops
```
do {
    /commands
} while([cond])
```
Der do-while-Loop funktioniert ähnlich, wie der while-Loop mit dem kleinen Unterschied, dass der Codeblock ausgeführt wird und danach erst die Bedingung geprüft wird.
Der Loop wird also mindestens einmal durchlaufen.
<a id=""foreach""></a>
### 4.13 forEach-Loop
```
forEach(var [var_name] = [startwert]; [var_name] ==|>|<|<=|>=|!= [other_var]|[number]; [varname]++){
    /commands
}
```
Der forEach-Loop ist ein Loop, wie man ihn in fast jeder Programmiersprache vorfindet.
Er ähnelt sich zu dem for-Loop von Minecraft Script, funktioniert aber dynamisch(d.h wird nicht beim generieren ausgeführt, sondern von Minecraft)

Bsp:
```
forEach(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    /say hey
}
```
Der Command wird also 10mal ausgeführt und der aktuelle Wert jeweils in dem scoreboard i gespeichert.
So kann man auch auf den Wert zugreifen. Bsp. Fakultät:
```
var result = 1
forEach(var i = 2; i <= 10; i++){
    result *= i
}
==> result = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 10
```
<a id=""modals""></a>
### 4.14 Modals
> ```
> modal [name]([arguments]){
>    [actions]
>}
>```
Modals kann man wie functions oder Methoden verstehen, dass heißt man kann sie definieren:


    modal newModal(argument){
    	/say $(argument)
    }	 					


Ein Modal wird immer mit dem Keyword eingeleitet, gefolgt von dem Namen und in Klammern alle benötigten Argumente.

Auf diese Argumente kann dann innerhalb mit $(argument_name) Referenz genommen werden.


    modal newModal(argument){
    	/say $(argument)
    }

    newModal('test')

    # => say test	 					


Wenn man das Modal so benutzt, dann werden die Werte eingesetzt und alles ausgegeben.


    modal createCommand(command,argument1,argument2){
    	/$(command) $(argument1) $(argument2)
    }

    createCommand('say', 'hallo', 'du')

    # => say hallo du 					


Es können so auch mehrere Argumente benutzt werden.

Auch sind optionale und vordefinierte Argumente verfügbar:


    modal say(argument = ""hallo""){
    	/say $(argument)
    }

    say()
    # => say hallo

    say('test')
    # => say test				

**Maps und Arrays benutzen**
Du kannst auch die [Map](#maps) und[Array](#arrays) typen der Konstanten in Modals benutzen:
```js
modal defaultMap(args = Map{""key"":""value""}){
    /say $(args).key
}
defaultMap()
defaultMap(Map{
    ""key"":""value2""
})

⇒ /say value
⇒ /say value2
```


**Modals überschreiben**
Bereits erstellte modals können innerhalb des Prozesses überschrieben werden:
> ```
> override modal [name]([arguments]){
>    [actions]
>}
>```

Dabei werden Argumente und Actions komplett getauscht und für den fortlaufenden Prozess verwendet.

**Argumente ersetzen**
Der Wert eines Arguments kann bei der Verwendung noch umgeändert werden. Hierzu ein `.repl()` an die Verwendung anfügen:
> `$(argument).repl([suchwert],[replacement])`

Bei unserem Beispiel wollen wir ein eingegebenes test replacen:
```
/say $(argument).repl(""test"",""no test"") ==> /say no test
```
Auch kann hier ein [RegEx](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) eingefügt werden und auch auf diesen im Replacement mit `$&` zugegriffen werden:
`$(argument).repl([/regex/],[""$&""])`
<a id=""modaljs""></a>
### 4.15 JavaScript Modals
JavaScript Modals sind modals, die in Javascript geschrieben sind. Du kannst sie, wie andere modals auch, so definieren:

> ```
> modaljs [name]([argumente]){
>     [aktionen]
>     return [Text]
> }
> ```
>
Das JavaScript Modal muss mit einem return statement enden. Das, was zurückgegeben wurde, wird in der `.mcfunction` Datei als einfacher Text erscheinen.

	modaljs newModal(){
    	return ""say hi"";
	}

    newModal()

	# => say hi
Für Absätze empfehle ich etwas ähnliches zu dem:

	modaljs newModal(){
		var ret = """";

		ret += ""say hi\n"";
		ret += ""say ho\n"";

    	return ret;
    }

	newModal()

	# => say hi
	# => say ho
Achtung: Du musst Absätze manuell mit `\n` hinzufügen.

Ein JavaScript modal ist immer deklariert durch das Keyword gefolgt vom Name und den Argumenten in den Klammern.

Die Argumente sind aufrufbar in dem Code.

    modaljs newModal(argument){
    	return ""say "" + argument;
    }

    newModal('test')

    # => say test	 					

Du kannst auch mehrere Argumente verwenden:

	modaljs newModal(text,monster){
		var ret = """";

		ret += ""say "" + text + ""\n"";
		ret += ""summon "" + monster + ""\n"";

    	return ret;
    }

	newModal(""Gehirne!!!"",""minecraft:zombie"")

	# => say Gehirne!!!
	# => summon minecraft:zombie

Es gibt ebenfalls optionale Argumente:

    modaljs say(argument = ""hallo""){
    	return ""say "" + argument ;
    }

    say()
    # => say hallo

    say('test')
    # => say test

**Tipps und Tricks**

Benutze `console.log`, um einige Informationen in der Konsole, während des Kompelieren, auszugeben, ohne den Wert zu verändern.

### 4.16 System Modals

Es gibt schon einige vordefinierte Modals, die hilfreich sein könnten. Bitte schaue dir dafür die spezifischen Dokumentationen [hier](https://github.com/Stevertus/mcscript/blob/master/Core%20Modals.md) an.

Du hast Ideen, welche Modals unbedingt als Standart-Modal aufgegriffen werden müssen? Sende mir einfach die [Konfigurationsdatei](#24_Dev_mcscript_modals_54) zur Überprüfung.
<a id=""debugging""></a>
### 4.17 Error handling und Debugging
Minecraft Script zeigt mit der Version 0.2 nur noch begrenzt Fehler an mit der Zeilen- und Dateiangabe.
Benutze beim generieren bitte die Flag `-fullErr`, um vollständige alte Fehler wiederzuerlangen, falls du sie wünscht.

Falls du Fehlerangaben findest, die im Kontext keinen Sinn machen, wende dich bitte an das Team.

**Debug keyword**
Mit ""Debug"" kannst du deinen Code debuggen und auch mögliche Fehler in Minecraft Script viel leichter entdecken. Sie können irgendwo im Code platziert werden und beeinflussen den generierten Code nicht.*
* `debug message: [message]`
Sendet eine einfache Nachricht in die Konsole mit Zeilen- und Dateiangaben.
* `debug success: [message]`
Sendet eine erfolgreiche Nachricht mit grüner Kennzeichnung in die Konsole mit Zeilen- und Dateiangaben.
* `debug break: [message]`
Dein Programm bricht an dieser Stelle ab und sendet erneut eine Nachricht.
* `debug error: [message]`
Dein Programm bricht an dieser Stelle ab und gibt einen kritischen Fehler mit Systeminformationen und relevanten Codestellen aus.

# Bonsai Trees 3

A Minecraft mod adding a block that grows small trees in a single block space.

## How to get started

1. Craft a Bonsai Pot and place it somewhere nice.
2. Find some soil to use in your pot. Dirt will do for now. Right-click it on the Bonsai Pot.
3. Get a tree sapling and right-click it on the Bonsai Pot. Or open the GUI and insert it into the sapling slot.
4. Watch it grow.
5. You can then optionally harvest the tree by clicking the ""Axe"" button in the GUI.
6. You can also upgrade your Bonsai Pot with various items. For now, put a wooden axe into one of the upgrade slots -
   your Bonsai will now be cut automatically.
7. Place a hopper below the Bonsai to extract the harvested items. Or insert it into an upgrade slot - the bonsai will
   then automatically export all items on the next harvest.
8. Use dyes to color your pot. Just right-click the pot while holding any dye.

A particular soil might be needed for some of the trees. And the different types of soil provide different boosts to the
growth of your Bonsai. It is recommended to use JEI to look up compatible saplings and available soils. TheOneProbe will
show what sapling is growing on what soil and its progress.

## Upgrades

### Hopper

Insert a hopper into one of the upgrade slots to make the Bonsai Pot automatically export all harvested items into the
inventory below. This is not needed to extract the items in a different way, e.g. you can also place the hopper or some
piping below the pot.

### Axes - or tools that can cut trees

Insert any kind of axe into an upgrade slot to make the Bonsai Bot automatically cut the tree for you once its fully
grown. But be aware that items that do not fit into the output buffer will be voided. You can enchant the axe with
Efficiency, Fortune and/or Silk Touch to get additional upgrade benefits!

You can configure in the Bonsai GUI whether applied redstone signals stop auto-cutting.

### Silk Touch

Some of the things a tree produces requires a Silk Touch upgrade. You can either put an enchanted axe or an
appropriately enchanted book into one of the upgrade slots. This does not prevent you from putting additional Fortune
Upgrades into the Bonsai Pot.

### Bee Hives - or Nests

Your Bonsai won't produce any fruits unless you pollinate them. Easiest is to stick a Bee Hive in there!

### Fortune

Increases number of rolls and chance for each possible drop. The higher the level the more items you get and the higher
the chance to get uncommon drops.

### Efficiency

Reduces the time it takes for a bonsai to fully grow. The higher the upgrade level the faster the growth.

## Configuration

### Clientside options

- `alwaysRenderAsItem (default: false)`
    - Always render trees in bonsai pot as their item equivalent.
    - Use this if you have performance problem. But please note that this is not the intended way for this mod.

### Shared options

- `enableFortuneUpgrade (default: true)`
    - Enable fortune upgrades
    - These increase the drop rolls and chances
    - Can still be inserted into upgrade slots, but effects are disabled.


- `enableEfficiencyUpgrade (default: true)`
    - Enable efficiency upgrades?
    - These decrease the required tick time for a tree to fully grow
    - Can still be inserted into upgrade slots, but effects are disabled.


- `enableHoppingUpgrade (default: true)`
    - Enable hopping upgrade?
    - Used to auto-push items to the inventory below
    - Can still be inserted into upgrade slots, but effects are disabled.


- `enableAutoCuttingUpgrade (default: true)`
    - Enable auto cutting upgrades?
    - Required for trees to get cut automatically
    - Can still be inserted into upgrade slots, but effects are disabled.


- `showChanceInJEI (default: true)`
    - Show chance for drops in JEI
    - Not sure why you wouldn't want this.


- `sumEnchantmentLevels (default: true)`
    - Summarize enchantment levels instead of using the highest level?
    - I.e. is '4 x Fortune III = Fortune XII'?
    - One can consider this to be quite overpowered.


- `extraRollsPerFortuneLevel = (default: 1)`
    - Drops: How many extra rolls per fortune enchantment level?
    - The more rolls the more items can be gained


- `extraChancePerFortuneLevel = (default: 0.05)`
    - Drops: What is the bonus chance to get a successful drop per fortune enchantment level?
    - The higher the chance the more likely it is that a roll counts towards the result.
    - These sum up, e.g. Fortune V gives a 25% chance boost with the default settings.


- `allowBonemeal = (default: true)`
    - Allow usage of bone meal on bonsai pots to boost their growth?
    - This is not really efficient - growing a regular sapling with bone meal results in larger amounts of wood than in
      a Bonsai Pot. Unless the Bonsai Pot is stuffed with Fortune upgrades - then it might be worth it.


- `bonemealSuccessChance = 0.45`
    - How likely is it for bonemeal to succeed in boosting growth?


- `hoppingCooldown (default: 60)`
    - How many ticks to wait before trying to insert items into the inventory below after failure?
    - Lowering this increases load on the server.


- `cuttingCooldown = (default: 60)`
    - How many ticks to wait before trying to cut the tree automatically after failing to do so?
    - Lowering this slightly increases load on the server.


- `autoCuttingDamagesItems (default: false)`
    - Auto-cutting does damage to the used axe upgrade
    - This means tools will break inside the bonsai pot.
    - The top side of the block can be used to access the upgrade slots and refill automatically.


- `autoCuttingDamageChance (default: 0.075)`
    - How likely is it that the axe upgrade takes damage for each tree it cuts?
    - This is independent of the Unbreaking enchantment

## Tree Compatibility

Supported Saplings and Soils are completely configurable via .json files. There are a bunch of examples available in the
repository for all the vanilla trees. But to make this more straight forward here's a quick rundown of what is needed
for a tree to be supported:

### Step 0, JSON

Know how JSON works. [Here's](https://cheatography.com/gaston/cheat-sheets/json/) a good quick rundown. Especially don't
include any of the comments from the examples here in the .json files.

### Step 1, Soil

Create the soil recipe first. You can skip this if you don't have custom soil requirements.

```js
{
  ""type"": ""bonsaitrees3:soil"",                 // The recipe type. Must be ""bonsaitrees3:soil""
  ""conditions"": [{                             // Conditions are optional
    ""type"": ""forge:mod_loaded"",
    ""modid"": ""tconstruct"" }                    // The mod required for this soil to get loaded
   ],
  ""tickModifier"": 1.0,                         // The time to grow a tree is multiplied by this value
  ""soil"": {
    ""item"": ""minecraft:grass_block""            // The item that plants this soil in the bonsai pot
  },
  ""compatibleSoilTags"": [
    ""grass""                                    // Only trees also having these tags can grow on this soil
  ],
  ""display"": {
    ""block"": ""minecraft:grass_block""            // The block that's being used to render the soil
    // ""fluid"": ""minecraft:lava""                // You can also use fluids here!
  }
}
```

### Step 2, Sapling

Create the sapling recipe:

```js
{
  ""type"": ""bonsaitrees3:sapling"",               // The recipe type. Must be ""bonsaitrees3:sapling""!
  ""conditions"": [{                              // Conditions are optional
    ""type"": ""forge:mod_loaded"",
    ""modid"": ""tconstruct"" }                     // The mod required for this tree to get loaded
   ],
  ""sapling"": { ""item"": ""minecraft:azalea"" },    // The ingredient that grows this tree (or whatever). Can also be an array of ingredients!
  ""drops"": [                                    // An array of drops this tree produces each harvest
    {
      ""rolls"": 1, ""chance"": 0.05,               // The number of rolls and the chance for each roll for this drop
      ""result"": { ""item"": ""minecraft:azalea"" }  // The name of the item for this drop
    },
    {
      ""rolls"": 1, ""chance"": 0.75,
      ""result"": { ""item"": ""minecraft:oak_log"" }
    },
    {
      ""rolls"": 3, ""chance"": 0.2,
      ""result"": { ""item"": ""minecraft:stick"" },
      ""requiredUpgrades"": {                     // EXPERIMENTAL: This allows configuring additional upgrade item required for this drop
        ""tag"": ""forge:fences""                   // This is a bit of a stupid example: Sticks only drop if a fence is used as upgrade item.
      }
    },
    {
      ""rolls"": 2, ""chance"": 0.15,
      ""result"": { ""item"": ""minecraft:azalea_leaves"" },
      ""requiresSilkTouch"": true                 // Indicates that this item only drops if a Silk Touch upgrade is present
    },
    {
      ""rolls"": 2, ""chance"": 0.05,
      ""result"": { ""item"": ""minecraft:flowering_azalea_leaves"" },
      ""requiresBees"": true                      // Indicates that this item only drops if a Bee Hive/Nest upgrade is installed
    }
  ],
  ""compatibleSoilTags"": [""dirt"", ""grass""]       // What types of soil this tree can grow on
}
```

### Step 3, Model

Create the model for the tree or whatever it is that you want to make growable. That's pretty easy as long as you don't
want to write the json file yourself. If there is no model for your sapling it will be rendered as the item version
instead.

a) Start up the game and find the tree, structure that should be grown in the pot.

b) Isolate it from any other blocks touching it. Diagonally also counts! To make sure just add a 2 block margin of air
around the ""thing"".

c) Run the /bonsai maker X Y Z command by looking at the thing and using tab completion. This will copy the wanted JSON
into your systems clipboard. Paste it into the newly created file.

d) Adjust the `type` property to `bonsaitrees3:sapling/XXX/YYY`, where `XXX` is the mod id and `YYY` is essentially the
name of the sapling file. Following the example above that would
be `""type"": ""bonsaitrees3:sapling/minecraft/azalea_tree""`.

### Step 4: Bundle it up

Equipped with these three files you now need to either create a Pull Request to get the support into the mod itself. Or
you create a data and a resource pack to distribute with your modpack. The files for the soil and sapling recipe belong
into a data pack, whereas the model belongs into a resource pack. The easiest way to get going there is to use
the [Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader) mod.

Where the files need to get placed depends on the way you want to integrate these changes. For Pull Requests this should
be

- `src/main/resources/assets/bonsaitrees3/models/tree/XXX/YYY.json` for the model
- `src/main/resources/data/bonsaitrees3/recipes/sapling/XXX/YYY.json` for sapling recipes
- `src/main/resources/data/bonsaitrees3/recipes/soil/XXX/YYY.json` for sapling recipes

If you create a datapack or resource pack your paths will be slightly different. Please read the
[Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader) description and the wiki pages it links to
([1](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_pack), [2](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_Pack)) to learn more
about this.

## Contributing to the project

You can easily help in multiple ways:

- Add translations using [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=suslQZqFoE)
- Create json files to support trees added by other mods
- Create data packs for originally unintended things:
  e.g. create a data+resource pack that allows growing iron/copper/gold nuggets. We are happy to promote those here and
  on the CurseForge project page.
- I am also looking for someone who can deal with Pull Requests for new trees/soils. If you know your way around json
  and git and want to help, please feel free to contact me."

Maintenance is the most customizable free maintenance plugin for your Minecraft server you can find. It runs on Spigot, BungeeCord, Sponge, as well as Velocity.

Its features include:
* A custom motd as well as server icon, that will be shown during maintenance
* Start- and endtimers, which will enable/disable maintenance mode after the time is up
* A '%TIMER%' variable usable in the pingmessage, to show the time until a running endtimer finishes (other variables and tricks are explained in the configuration file's comments)
* A maintenance whitelist, to grant specific players the ability to join while you're working on your server
* Nearly all messages are editable via the language file, given in a multitude of different languages
* Features specifically for Bungee/Velocity
  * Only want to enable maintenance on a single server? You can also do so by using the `/maintenance <on/off> <servername>` command
  * Link multiple proxy instances through a MySQL database connection, so you don't have to change maintenance on each proxy by hand
  * Use PlaceholderAPI placeholders with the [**MaintenanceAddon**](https://github.com/kennytv/Maintenance/wiki/MaintenanceAddon) (only for Bungee)

This internal array is in the format of (Key => Value) ""username"" => Minecraft username 
(properly capitalized) ""uuid"" => Minecraft UUID.

### ProfileUtils::formatUUID
Takes in an unformatted UUID string and returns a formatted uuid string."
833,copygirl/WearableBackpacks,Java,"# Wearable Backpacks

.. is a Minecraft mod which adds **backpacks**. But wait! It's not like anything you've
seen before. **Wearable Backpacks** continues the legacy of [BetterStorage][BS]'s
backpacks, and brings with it a beautifully designed and balanced alternative backpack
option unlike any other!

![Backpacks!](docs/header.png)

*""Backpacks are love. Backpacks are life.""* -asiekierka  
*""copy-who?""* -MindlessPuppetz

## What's so great?

- **There can be only one!**
  Other mods allow you to carry multiple backpacks in your inventory. **WBs** doesn't.
  This design, as well as the resulting implementation has been carried over from its
  predecessor. But what the mod is lacking in convenience, it's trying to make up in
  charm and configurability.

  ![](docs/picture_1.png)

- **Armor up, or storage up?**
  With the default settings, backpacks will function as armor, taking up the chest armor
  equipment slot, protecting from as well as taking damage just like leather armor. This
  way, you have to *choose* between more protection or more storage. This can be turned
  off though, in case you don't like it.

- **Play with friends, share backpacks!**
  Having a backpack on your back looks cool and all, but if only you could do something
  with that beauty. Well, lucky you! Other players (hopefully, without ill intentions)
  can open your backpack and borrow a pick and some torches on a mining trip. This of
  course only works as long as your back is facing towards them.

  ![](docs/picture_2.png)

- **Dying is [FUN][FUN]!**
  Sick of losing all your valuables when you make a small little misstep into the nearest
  pool of lava? Don't worry, the items inside your backpack will be... mostly safe. While
  the backpack itself is not immune to explosions or being broken by other players, after
  death it will gently place itself down near your point of failure, ready to be
  retrieved.

- **Dyeing is fun~!**
  Backpacks can be colored using Minecraft's *fantastic* dyeing system. Unlike some silly
  mods that only allow the 16 base colors, with our pretties you can mix and match your
  dyes to customize them in any way you like!

  ![](docs/picture_3.png)

- **Configuration Nation**
  Not sure if **WBs** will fit your play style? Don't worry! This mod is meant to be
  incredibly configurable with its [easy-to-use ingame config menu][CONF]. This allows
  backpacks to be balanced, regardless of whether they're used in a personal hand-picked
  pack, a huge kitchen sink modpack or a deadly hardcore-massacre-of-doom experience with
  sprinkles on top.

## Usage

Think of **Wearable Backpacks** backpacks as portable, wearable chests. After you've
crafted one, simply place it on the ground and fill it with whatever you'd like to take
with you. Next, **sneak** and **break** the backpack to **equip** it. You'll notice that
equipping is faster than breaking.

Now that the backpack is where it belongs (your back), you can **unequip** it again by
**sneaking** and **right-clicking** the ground with an **empty hand** (specifically, the
top of a solid block).

By turning on a config option, it's also possible to open the backpack using a keybind,
which you can find in the controls menu (default: `B`).

### Crafting Recipe

- 7x Leather
- 1x Gold Ingot
- 1x Wool

![Backpack Recipe](docs/recipe_backpack.png)

### Additional Features

- As already mentioned above, this mod has many, easy to use configuration options.
  Simply click **Mods** in the main menu or **Mod Options** ingame, search for
  ""Wearable Backpacks"" and click the **Config** button.
- When backpacks are equipped as armor, they may also be enchanted just like armor.
  (This feature is missing from 1.10 due to missing enchantment hooks in Forge.)
- Some mobs may rarely spawn with backpacks equipped, containing random loot.

837,nmarus/docker-pocketmine,Shell,"# Pocketmine for Docker

This is an implementation of the [Pocketmine] (https://www.pocketmine.net) LAN server for allowing [Minecraft-PE IOS clients] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minecraft-pocket-edition/id479516143?mt=8) to play. This is running the development version of pocketmine to support the [recent updates] (http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/222592/pocketmine-mp-installation-not-completing-connections) to the client protocol that Minecraft-PE uses. 

### To run pocketmine as a docker container:

    docker run -d -it -p 19132:19132/tcp -p 19132:19132/udp --name pocketmine nmarus/docker-pocketmine:latest
    
This creates a new container from the repository, names the container ""mcpe"", downloads the latest development build of pocketmine, and maps the ports for client access to the local host. This is not recommend as you will lose your configuration file when th container stops and starts. 
    
The *recommended* way is to utilize a local directory that is external to the container for your configuration files. This will allow persistent configuration if you remove the container, or if you wish to edit the configuration files manually and restart pocketmine. To do this, first create a foler on the host where you wish to store these:

    mkdir /srv/pocketmine
    
Then run the container with these added option:

    docker run -d -it -p 19132:19132/tcp -p 19132:19132/udp  -v /srv/pocketmine:/data --name pocketmine nmarus/docker-pocketmine:latest

### To start the container:
If the container is stoped (run ""docker ps -a"" to verify), and you wish to start it, run: 

    docker start pocketmine

### To stop the container:
If you wish to stop the container in order to rebvoot the host os or updaet configuration files, run:

    docker stop pocketmine

### To interact with pocketmine administration:

    docker attach pocketmine
    
This allows you to jump into the pocketmine administration session. Type ""help"" for options. If you enter the command ""stop"", this will end pocket mine and stop the container. To restart pocketmine with our stopping the container, enter ""restart"" in the pocket mine admin session.
    
*To exit the admistration interface, press control-p, control-q. This is in order to maintain the container in service.*

### To view the logs in realtime run:

    docker logs -l pocketmine
    
This allows you to view the logs generated from the pocketmine server in a ""tail -f"" type format. 
    
*Press control-c to exit*

###To update minecraft pe to latest version:
Simply stop the pocketmine container and then start it. the latest version of pocketmine will be downloaded. 

*This assumes you are mapping your configuration to a directory external to the container. If not, you will lose your world...*

    docker stop pocketmine
    docker start pocketmine
    
### News:

*Change log 2015-7-11*

* Added updates for mapping local data directory for pocketmine configuration files.
* Removed memory options from server.properties file as it is now defined in the yaml file. 

*Open Items:*

* Build logic to perform upgrade of server code without needing to rebuild the container. 
* Test RCON functionality.
* Implement variable in Dockerfile to specify initial configuration option in server.properties file. 
* Generate random RCON password when server.properties file does not exist.

Library mainly designed to provide cross-version support for Minecraft Bukkit plugins,
but it also includes numerous extra methods to help developers design their plugins easier and efficiently.
Some utilities are completely unrelated to cross-version support such as NoteBlockMusic.

Don't forget to add `api-version: ""1.13""` to your `plugin.yml`. This will keep the plugin working even if the server is not 1.13

This project aims to provide quality utilities with high performance using the latest, yet efficient techniques.
Although support for old versions (like 1.8) will still remain for future updates, I highly encourage all developers
drop support for anything below 1.12


### Links

This project was mainly posted in [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/378136/)\
Most of the updates and news will be announced there.


### Getting Started

When compiling your plugin you should be using the latest version that your plugin is going to support.\
Which means, at least you have to use 1.13 (for cross-version support utilities only)
You can clone the project using: `git clone https://github.com/CryptoMorin/XSeries.git`

All the methods are explained in the JavaDocs. Please read them before using a method.
It's quite common to miss the whole purpose of cross-version support and the efficiency of the utility by using the wrong methods.

You can use most of these utilities individually or use the maven dependency.
Most of the utilities are intended to be independent. However, some
utilities such as [XParticle](src/main/java/com/cryptomorin/xseries/particles/XParticle.java) are intended to use
another class ([ParticleDisplay](src/main/java/com/cryptomorin/xseries/particles/ParticleDisplay.java))


#### Maven ![maven-central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.cryptomorin/XSeries)
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.cryptomorin</groupId>
    <artifactId>XSeries</artifactId>
    <version>version</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle
```kotlin
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
  implementation(""com.github.cryptomorin:XSeries:version"") { isTransitive = false }
}
```

You shouldn't worry if the reflection or other classes are going to use your memory with heavy useless static cache.
As long as you don't use them anywhere in your code, they won't initialize.
The memory usage of these utilities are extremely enhanced.

**Note:** DO NOT extract the JAR into your project if you're using maven. You have to shade the library,
otherwise your plugin or other plugins will break due to version mismatch.
To shade the library, add the following under your maven plugins:
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.4</version>

        </relocations>
        <!-- Here you can remove the classes you don't use. -->
        <!-- These are some examples. -->
        <!-- The ""unused"" package and SkullCacheListener are excluded by default. -->

#MCDungeon#

MCDungeon will create a procedurally generated dungeon in a preexisting
Minecraft map. It is not yet feature complete, but can already generate
dungeons with quite a bit of variety. 

Website: http://mcdungeon.bubblemod.org

Documentation: http://mcdungeon-docs.bubblemod.org

##CURRENT FEATURES:##

   * Automatically finds a good location on a map based on range, size, and
     depth parameters. Can detect player structures and try not to overwrite
     them. Avoids placing dungeons in the middle of the ocean.

   * Dungeons can be removed from a map later and the landscape allowed to
     regenerate. 

   * Dungeons can be regenerated in place with a new layout, mobs, and 
     treasure.

   * Can generate multiple dungeons in a map, or try to fill the map with as
     many dungeons as possible.

   * Generates room layouts based on a random weighted selection
     of rooms. Rooms are filled with random hallways, floors, room
     features, and ruins on the surface, all of which are configurable.

   * The density and placement of doors, portcullises, and torches are 
     configurable. Option to place fewer torches as levels go down. Less 
     light == more danger!

   * A ""fill caves"" mode that will fill in nearby natural caves in an attempt
     to concentrate random monster spawns inside the dungeon.

   * Places stairwells between levels, and a random entrance with a
     spiraling staircase. Some entrances have a configurable height so it 
     can be seen from far away.

   * Places chests with loot around the dungeon in (probably) hard
     to reach places. An arbitrary number of loot tables can be configured
     to provide variety. The density of chests is configurable. Custom
     potions, magic items, and armor. The heads of legendary adventurers. 

   * Places mob spawners throughout the dungeon. These will likely be near
     chests, but not always. Mob types are configurable. The density of
     spawners is configurable. Some 'non-standard' mobs are available.
     Custom mob spawners can be created with an NBT editor.

   * Optional in-game maps of dungeons.

   * Random placement of secret traps and puzzles.

   * Output floor maps to a terminal with color on ANSI systems.

   * Output entire dungeon maps to HTML.

##TODO##

   * More room, hall, floor, feature, and ruin types.
   * More traps!
   * Harder hard mode!
   * More stuff as Minecraft evolves!

##QUICK START##

   The stand-alone versions for Windows and OS X, include a 
   ""launcher"" script that will run in interactive mode. For advanced
   usage, run the mcdungeon executable from the command line like
   the python version. 

   List available subcommands and options:

   ```
   $ python mcdungeon.py --help
   $ ./mcdungeon --help
   ```

   Help on a specific subcommand:

   ```
   $ python mcdungeon.py <subcommand> --help
   $ ./mcdungeon <subcommand> --help
   ```

##PYTHON REQUIREMENTS##

   * Python 2.7
   * numpy
   * pyyaml
   * nbt2yaml
   * futures (Linux and OSX)

##PYTHON EXAMPLES##

   These also work for the stand-alone version. Just replace 
   ""python mcdungeon.py"" with ""mcdungeon""

   ```
   $ python mcdungeon.py interactive
   ```

   Run in interactive mode. From here you can add, list, delete or regenerate
   dungeons.

   ```
   $ python mcdungeon.py add Dungeon 5 4 3 --term 1
   ```

   Load a world named 'Dungeon', generate a 5x4x3 dungeon layout
   (5 rooms E/W, 4 rooms N/S, and 3 levels deep) and display
   the results in a terminal window. (In color on ANSI terminals
   only. Sorry Windows) The world files will not be modified, but
   are required. Basically a ""dry run.""

   ```
   $ python mcdungeon.py add Dungeon 4-6 4-6 5-8 -n 5 --write
   ```

   Generate five random dungeons between the sizes of 4x4x5 and 6x6x8
   and save them to the world.

##EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS##

   Several example configs are included. These can be copied and/or modifed
   to suit your own tastes.

   * default.cfg
   
     A little of everything. This one is heavily commented. If you want to
     know what a config option does, look here.

   * more_mobs.cfg
 
     This produces maps that are the same as the default, but with
     more types of monsters and more spawners.

   * caverns.cfg   

     Mostly cavern type rooms. Very few ""dungeon"" looking rooms
     except the treasure chambers. It's a bit like exploring caves
     with the occasional dungeon room.

   * maze.cfg 

     Basically bumps up the number of corridor type rooms and the
     number of loops the dungeon layout has. You'll end up with
     fewer rooms and lots of twisty halls to get lost in. 

   * easy_mode.cfg 

     Better treasure, fewer monsters and traps. Easier dungeon layout
     (very linear) and maps of every level.

   * hard_mode.cfg

     Less treasure in upper levels, more confusing dungeon layout
     (lots of loops) more monster spawners. Hidden spawners. Creepers
     are more common. Buffed monster spawners. No maps. It also
     fills in all the surrounding underground caves so that monsters
     spawn inside the dungeon much more frequently. No exit portals.

Nutrition is a highly configurable mod to enable the creation of health systems in Minecraft.

[Download](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/releases) | [Wiki](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/wiki) | [Changelog](changelog.md)

![Nutrition GUI](screenshots/gui.png ""Nutrition GUI"")

Through its [config files](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/wiki/Configuration), Nutrition allows you to define custom food groups (called [nutrients](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/wiki/Nutrients)) which apply [effects](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/wiki/Effects) based on nutrition levels.

By default, Nutrition comes configured with the classic five food group system: dairy, fruit, grain, protein, and vegetables.  However many different systems are possible.  Some examples include:

* A spicy tolerance bar, where eating enough spicy foods will grant a permanent resistance to fire.
* A zombie simulation where you must eat brains to avoid negative effects.
* Gluten intolerance.  Eat bread, get sick.

When updating the mod, please delete your `/config/nutrition/nutrients/` directory to receive new mod support.  This is necessary so we don't overwrite any customizations.

848,FabricMC/fabric-loom,Java,"# Fabric Loom

A [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) plugin to setup a deobfuscated development environment for Minecraft mods. Primarily used in the Fabric toolchain.

* Has built in support for tiny mappings (Used by [Yarn](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn))
* Utilises the Fernflower and CFR decompilers to generate source code with comments.
* Designed to support modern versions of Minecraft (Tested with 1.14.4 and upwards)
* Built in support for IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and Visual Studio Code to generate run configurations for Minecraft.
* Loom targets the latest version of Gradle 7 or newer 
* Supports Java 16 upwards

## Use Loom to develop mods

To get started developing your own mods please follow the guide on [Setting up a mod development environment](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup).

## Debugging Loom (Only needed if you want to work on Loom itself)

_This guide assumes you are using IntelliJ IDEA, other IDE's have not been tested; your experience may vary._

1. Import as a Gradle project by opening the build.gradle
2. Create a Gradle run configuration to run the following tasks `build publishToMavenLocal -x test`. This will build Loom and publish to a local maven repo without running the test suite. You can run it now.
3. Prepare a project for using the local version of Loom:
   * A good starting point is to clone the [fabric-example-mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) into your working directory
   * Add `mavenLocal()` to the repositories:
     * If you're using `id 'fabric-loom'` inside `plugins`, the correct `repositories` block is inside `pluginManagement` in settings.gradle
     * If you're using `apply plugin:` for Loom, the correct `repositories` block is inside `buildscript` in build.gradle
   * Change the loom version to `0.6.local`. For example `id 'fabric-loom' version '0.6.local'`
4. Create a Gradle run configuration:
   * Set the Gradle project path to the project you have just configured above
   * Set some tasks to run, such as `clean build` you can change these to suit your needs.
   * Add the run configuration you created earlier to the ""Before Launch"" section to rebuild loom each time you debug
5. You should now be able to run the configuration in debug mode, with working breakpoints.

 * Claim ownership of partial or total amounts of the original or re-packaged work.

**You MUST**
 * Keep a visible and clear repository of the code of which that is derived/inspried from this repository. Of course, you still maintain rights of your code, however you still need to keep a visible source.

`LiteLoaderBDS` is an unofficial plugin loader that provides basic API support for `Bedrock Dedicated Server`, with a
massive API, lots of packed utility interfaces, a rich event system and powerful basic interface support.

`LiteLoader` provides a massive API, a powerful event system and a large number of encapsulated development
infrastructure interfaces, providing a solid foundation for extending the Bedrock Edition **BDS** with more gameplay and
functionality. With plugins, it is easy to extend the functionality of BDS, the associated development is easy to learn,
and the development approach is flexible.

Writing plugins in **C++, JavaScript, Lua, C#**  and other languages, which allows developers to easily extend and
customize **BDS** functionality,
making it easy to learn and extremely flexible.

<br/>

## 🎁 First impression

> - “Why should I choose LiteLoader?”
>
> - They have interface that is easy to use and intuitive!!

#### C++ language sample plugin

```c++
// Template project: https://github.com/LiteLDev/PluginTemplate
// More examples: https://github.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoaderPlugins
#include <llapi/EventAPI.h>
#include <llapi/LoggerAPI.h>
#include <llapi/LLAPI.h>
#include <llapi/mc/Actor.hpp>
#include <llapi/mc/Player.hpp>

Logger logger(""AttackLog"");

void PluginInit() {
    logger.info(""Plugin xxx has been loaded."");
    // Subscribe Player-Attack Event
    Event::PlayerAttackEvent::subscribe([](const Event::PlayerAttackEvent& ev) {
        Player* player = ev.mPlayer;
        Actor* actor = ev.mTarget;
        logger.info(""Player:{} attacks {} | at {} in Dimension {}"",
            player->getRealName(), actor->getTypeName(), 
            actor->getPos().toString(), std::to_string(actor->getDimensionId())
        );
        return true;
    });
}
```

#### Script language sample plugin (Use Js as an example)

```javascript
// Register for shutdown command
mc.listen(""onServerStarted"", () => {
    const cmd = mc.newCommand(""stopsvr"", ""close server"");
    cmd.overload();
    cmd.setCallback((_cmd, ori, out, _res) => {
        out.success(""stop command executed successfully"");
        mc.broadcast(
            `${ori.player.realName} executed the stop command. The server will be shutdown after 5 seconds`
        );

        // Execute stop command
        setTimeout(() => mc.runcmd(""stop""), 5000);
    });
    cmd.setup();
});
```

## 💻 Install

### For Windows

1. Download the latest <code>LiteLoader-<i>version</i>.zip</code>
   from [Releases](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoader/releases)
   or [Actions](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoader/actions),
2. Unzip everything into the directory of `bedrock_server.exe`. If you are prompted with conflicting files during the
   decompression process, just select `Overwrite`.
3. Ensure that the `bedrock_server.pdb` file exists.
   Run `LLPeEditor.exe` to generate the BDS with the exported symbols (`bedrock_server_mod.exe`)
4. When the console output `Press any key to continue . . .` , press any key to close the window
5. Execute `bedrock_server_mod.exe` and enjoy it!

### For Linux

We do not recommend you to use Wine due to BDS 1.19.20+ on Wine has a performance problem

#### Installation script(Ubuntu)

```
wget https://github.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoaderBDS/raw/develop/scripts/install.sh && sh install.sh
```

#### Docker

Enter the following lines in your terminal:

```
docker pull shrbox/liteloaderbds
mkdir <install directory>
docker create --name llbds -v <install directory>:/root/bedrock-server -p 19132:19132/udp -i -t shrbox/liteloaderbds
```

`<install directory>` is directory to store data, for example: `/home/shrbox/bedrock-server`  
The first boot takes a little while to download the Bedrock Dedicated Server and LiteLoaderBDS  
Start server: `docker container start llbds -a`  
Force stop server(not recommended): `docker container stop llbds`

857,Minifixio/pocketmine-1vs1-plugin,PHP,"# 1vs1 plugin by Minifixio

## Description:
You want to make 1vs1s on your MCPE server ? This plugin is for you !

Cool things:
-> Multi arenas system
-> Auto queue management
-> Statistics signs


## How to use:
-> First, you'll need to reference your(s) arena(s) doing /refarena on the middle of your arena. The players will spawn 5 blocks from the middle of the arena (see example below). You can make an unlimited numbers of arenas. All the arenas’s positions are saved in the config.yml file.

-> Then, the players can start a duel doing /match, a countdown before the fight will start (only 2 players per arena) and they will be teleported in an arena and they will get a sword, armor and food and all their effects will be removed for fight. The fight last 3 minutes and at the end of the timer if there is no winners, the duel ends and the players are teleported back to the spawn.

-> You can place a sign and write on the 1st line : « [1vs1] » to have a 1vs1 stats sign with the numbers of active arenas and the number of the players in the queue. The signs refreshes every 5 seconds.

## Technical:
-> After a fight, the players are teleported back to the spawn of the default level server.

-> When a player quit in a fight, his opponent win.

-> The arenas and the 1vs1’s signs positions are stored in the config.yml file.

-> When a player quit during the start match countdown, the match stops.


## Commands:
-> /match : join the 1vs1 queue
-> /refarena : reference a new arena.


## Notes:
-> Maybe you will find some mistakes in my plugin documentation, it’s just because i’m not english (french :c).

-> You can only change the messages in the plugin source but soon you will can change it in a message config file.

-> You will able to change the spawn distance in a arena and the timers for the matches in an update soon.

-> Any remarks ? Tell me it for a better world x) !

## Disclaimers

By using this modpack, you agree to the following:

* The modpack has been set up to be compatible with the rules of most public third-party servers, but it is your responsibility to verify whether you are allowed to use it or not. By installing this modpack you agree that the modpack author, the mod developers and Mojang provide no warranties for using this modpack, every action you do with it is your own.   
    * The command *`/ghost`* (provided by [AntiGhost](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/antighost)) may be disallowed by the rules on some servers [as it sends a slight amount of packets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/antighost?comment=103), but it is safe if you don't spam it, use only when you are stuck in blocks.
* This modpack is using [Starlight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight) for chunk optimization and [due to the way it works](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md#chunk-save-format), disabling (or replacing) the mod will make your existing worlds initially load a bit slower. This is harmless, it simply means the game is calculating the lit up areas again with a different algorithm.
* This modpack disables the [third-party server disclaimer](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Multiplayer_disclaimer.png), so if you are using the multiplayer function, you also agree to the following: 
    > Caution: Online play is offered by third-party servers that are not owned, operated, or supervised by Mojang Studios or Microsoft. During online play, you may be exposed to unmoderated chat messages or other types of user-generated content that may not be suitable for everyone. 
    *  [The ""social interactions"" screen](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Social_Interactions_screen#Usage) can be used by pressing the key `P` in-game or the `Player Reporting` button in the pause menu.
    * On servers where Mojang's chat reporting is optional, the modpack opts out of it for the playing user. Chat status icons are changed to provide more accurate information about the signing state of the server. [Read more](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/chat-reporting-faq).
* Fabulously Optimized does not host any capes or other cosmetics, nor does it encourage users to buy them from any provider. Instead, the modpack encourages users to [prefer free cosmetics](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/free-cape), while also giving them options to use any paid cosmetics they've previously obtained from certain providers.  
* Yes, you can fork/remix this pack [according to the license](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/LICENSE.md). You cannot, however, use the ""Fabulously Optimized"" name or logo to _represent_ your fork (but you can mention that you forked it).

861,Kas-tle/java2bedrock.sh,Shell,"## Usage

### Local

To run, simply:
```
./converter.sh MyResourcePack.zip
```

To run without settings prompts, use flags:
- `-w (true|false)` whether or not to show the warning prompt 
- `-m (pack_to_merge.mcpack)` filename of Bedrock Edition resource pack in the same diretory to merge with result of the conversion
- `-a (attachable_material)` material to use for attachables written by the script
- `-b (block_material)` material to use for blocks written by the script
- `-f (https://somesite.com/fallback_pack.zip|null)` URL of a Java Edition resource to use for fallback textures before the default pack
- `-v (default_asset_version)` version of Minecraft Java Edition for which to pull default assets

For example:

```
./converter.sh MyResourcePack.zip -w ""false"" -m ""MyBedrock.mcpack"" -a ""entity_alphatest_one_sided"" -b ""alpha_test"" -f ""null"" -v ""1.18.2""
```

### Item Icons

If you prepare 2D sprites for your 3D models, you can provide the converter with mappings for these sprites to be incorporated into item_texture.json and the exported Geyser mappings. To do so, simply include a file called `sprites.json` in the root of your Java resource pack. The format of this file is as follows:
```json
{
    ""leather"": [
        {
            ""custom_model_data"": 1,
            ""sprite"": ""textures/path/to/texture_in_bedrock_rp/texture1""
        },
        {
            ""custom_model_data"": 2,
            ""sprite"": ""textures/path/to/texture_in_bedrock_rp/texture2""
        }
    ],
    ""diamond_axe"": [
        {
            ""damage_predicate"": 2,
            ""unbreakable"": true,
            ""sprite"": ""textures/path/to/texture_in_bedrock_rp/texture3""
        }
    ]
}
```

When utilizing this feature, you should also use the merge feature to combine the converted pack with an existing Bedrock resource pack containing the specified sprite textures. If using the Github Actions based converter, simply provide a direct download URL of said Bedrock resource pack as done for the Java pack.

### Github Actions

You may also run the converter through Github Actions in this repository by creating an issue with the [Pack Conversion](https://github.com/Kas-tle/java2bedrock.sh/issues/new?assignees=&labels=conversion&template=pack-conversion.yml&title=%5BPack%5D%3A+) template. You are only required to enter the link to the Java pack, though the options described above may also be configured. Your pack will then be queued for conversion by Github Actions. After conversion is complete, the Github Actions bot will reply to your issue with a link to download your converted pack and associated mappings file. Included in the bundle is a behavior pack and addon to view the models in single player, as well as a configuration file containing the paths to the models converted from the Java resource pack and their corresponding identifiers in the Bedrock resource pack.

**NOTICE:** Due to [MCPE-152191](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-152191), any blocks that are larger than 1.9 blocks will not load. This is only relavent to those using the preview pack to display converted models in single player.

The script has been updated to handle parent models and 2D items. It will generate multiple sprite sheets for 3D models without repeating the inclusion of any given texture. 2D item textures will be copied over individually. Note that sprites for 3D items must be added manually.

Your script and resource pack zip file must be in the same directory. Ensure that this zip file is properly setup. It should not have a root directory. Your resource pack must also be formatted correctly, to vanilla specifications. By default, this script will download the default assets in order to generate texture atlases in cases in which you have utilized those. If you wish to use different default assets, you may specify this at the beginning. The default pack will then be downloaded after your specified assets, with your specified assets taking precedence. As long as you provide valid JSON, the script should output something you can use.

You may also specify an input bedrock pack to merge with the output assets produced by the converter. This should be in the same directory as the script and your input Java pack. Like the Java pack, ensure that it is compressed with no root folder. When prompted, type the file name of the input file, such as `example_rp.mcpack`. Merging of behavior packs is not currently supported.

The packs generated by this script can currently only be used in Bedrock Edition 1.16.210.59 and above. Please be sure to enable the experimental setting ""Holiday Creator Features"" on world generation. You'll probably also want to be in creative mode as that will be the only way to give yourself the blocks generated by the script. Here are the commands to obtain one of the items or place them in your head slot:
```
/give @p geysercmd:gmdl_xxxxxxx
/replaceitem entity @p slot.armor.head 0 geysercmd:gmdl_xxxxxxx
``` 
The `xxxxxxx` term corresponds to the short hash assigned to the model. These are written to config.json, which can be found in the target directory, along with packaged and non-packaged versions of the output assets. This will specify the corresponding item and nbt for each input predicate. The short hash is constructed by combining the predicate entry's item, custom model data, damage, and damaged predicates, taking the md5 hash of this string, and keeping only the first 7 characters. As a result, this hash value will remain the same across conversions.

Also note that this script requires:
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) (1.6+)
- [sponge](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/)
- [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) (6+)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [spritesheet-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spritesheet-js)

It will exit if you fail to meet these dependencies. While the ultimate intention here is to import these via Geyser, the script currently generates a behavior pack so that you may view your converted models in Bedrock Edition. It also generates a mappings file compliant with Geyser's custom item mappings system.

Should you have any complaints about getting this to run because you ""only use windows"", do note that I was able to run this perfectly fine on a Mac running Parallels to run Windows to run WSL to run Ubuntu 20. Therefore, I am sure it is perfectly possible for you to get this working, regardless of your OS. I will gladly take such criticism only if you are willing to help develop this into a proper cross platform program. 

## Dependency Installation

### Debian, Ubuntu, & Mint
```sh
sudo apt-get install moreutils jq imagemagick unzip zip nodejs uuid-runtime
npm i -g spritesheet-js
```

### MacOS
```sh
brew install moreutils jq imagemagick unzip zip nodejs uuid-runtime
npm i -g spritesheet-js
```

### RHEL, Fedora, & Centos
```sh
sudo yum install moreutils jq imagemagick unzip zip nodejs uuid-runtime
npm i -g spritesheet-js
```

### Arch Linux
```sh
sudo pacman -S moreutils jq imagemagick unzip zip nodejs uuid-runtime
npm i -g spritesheet-js
```

### Windows
Impossible; consider [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

#### Special Notes for WSL (Ubuntu)

In general, packages on WSL seem to be a little wonky, and sometimes jq-1.5 will be installed, which will not work. To manually install jq-1.6 on WSL, at least for Ubuntu:
```sh
wget https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.6/jq-linux64 && sudo chmod +x jq-linux64 && sudo mv jq-linux64 /usr/bin/jq
```

If you install spritesheet-js globally, but the script fails due to missing the dependency, ensure that the folder containing your global node modules is added to your path. If, after installing, `which spritesheet-js` returns no output, you may add global node modules to your path by:
```sh
echo ""export PATH=$PATH:$(npm config --global get prefix)/bin"" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

This is a simple chunk pack for minecraft bedrock edtion. To use it, attach it as a typical resource pack to either global or world resources. To view the chunk borders, go into 3rd person and put a rocket or a nautilus shell in your off-hand; this will enable the chunk visibility, and subsequently disable it if either of these two items are not in your off-hand.

## Volumes

**Worlds**
* **Local folder:** /volume1/docker/bedrockserver/worlds
* **Mount path:** /bedrock-server/worlds

## Port Settings

**TCP**
* **Local Port:** 19132 TCP
* **Container Port:** 19132 TCP

**UDP**
* **Local Port:** 19132 UDP
* **Container Port:** 19132 UDP

Open these ports of the local ip of your NAS to the internet in your router. Consult the manual of your router for this.

![Correct local and container ports](https://marc.tv/media/2020/01/bedrock-port.jpg ""Correct local and container ports"")

### Optional: edit server.properties and allowlist.json

To edit the server.properties and allowlist.json you have to add them locally on your NAS
and mount these files in the container.

![Correct local and container paths](https://marc.tv/media/2019/04/bedrock-server-properties.jpg ""Correct local and container paths"")

Download these files and place them in the parent folder of your bedrock docker folder. e.g.

* [Example server.properties file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtoensing/Docker-Minecraft-Bedrock-Server/master/server.properties)
* [Example empty allowlist.json file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtoensing/Docker-Minecraft-Bedrock-Server/master/allowlist.json)

**Worlds**
* **Local folder:** /volume1/docker/bedrockserver/worlds
* **Mount path:** /bedrock-server/worlds

**server.properties**
* **Local file server.properties:** /volume1/docker/bedrockserver/server.properties
* **Mount path:** /bedrock-server/server.properties

**allowlist.json**
* **Local file allowlist.json:** /volume1/docker/bedrockserver/allowlist.json
* **Mount path:** /bedrock-server/allowlist.json

You can edit the server.properties on you NAS directly after you shut down the server. You can edit specific options like gamemode (creative or survival) or enable the allowlist. The later is highly recommended if you plan to open the ports to the internet.

## Add someone to the allowlist and grant user admin rights

You can enter commands in terminal on Synology on your Docker Container. Add users to the allowlist and do not edit the allowlist.json manually:

**allowlist add [xbox playername]**

e.g. `allowlist add MarcTV`

**op [xbox playername]**

e.g. `op MarcTV`

This only works if the user is online.

866,dizzyd/mcdex,Go,"# mcdex - Minecraft Modpack Management

mcdex is a command-line utility that runs on Linux, Windows and OSX 
and makes it easy to manage your modpacks while using the native
Minecraft launcher.

## Downloads

You can find the most recent releases here:

* [Windows](http://files.mcdex.net/releases/win32/mcdex.exe)
* [Linux](http://files.mcdex.net/releases/linux/mcdex)
* [OSX](http://files.mcdex.net/releases/osx/mcdex)

## Getting started

First, make sure you have the most recent database of mods:

```
mcdex db.update
```

## Listing available mod packs on Curseforge

If you want to find all the published modpacks available with 'engineer' in the name, you can do:

```
mcdex pack.list engineer 
```

You'll see output like:

```
advanced-engineering-immersive-rocketry | A RotaryCraft-esque pack for 1.12 | 154 downloads
age-of-engineering | Tech-only modpack with guide and trophies. Focus in progression, divided in 15 ages | 438,304 downloads
ancient-engineering | A light pack focused around Ancient Warfare and Immersive Engineering. | 4,856 downloads
arie-advanced-engineering | Modpack filled with immersive tech mods, combined with the possibility of exploring the galaxy! | 53 downloads
atmospheric-engineering | an overloaded skyfactory style modpack | 0 downloads
coles-engineering | An engineering modpack with big dig vibes | 60 downloads
...
...
```

The first part of each line is the ""slug""; we'll use this in the next step to install the modpack.

## Installing a modpack from Curseforge

Now, let's install the [Age of Engineering](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/age-of-engineering) modpack.

Using the slug we found via pack.list, run:
```
mcdex pack.install aoe age-of-engineering
```

Note that we provide the name ""aoe""; mcdex uses this to install the modpack into your Minecraft home directory
under ```<minecraft>/mcdex/pack/aoe```. Alternatively, you can control what directory the modpack is installed in by passing
an absolute path (e.g. `c:\aoe` or `/Users/dizzyd/aoe`) as the name and mcdex will use that instead.

Once the install is done, you can fire up the Minecraft launcher and you should have a new profile for the aoe pack!

## Creating a new modpack

We can start a new modpack by using the ```pack.create``` command:

```
mcdex pack.create mypack 1.11.2
```

Note that the recommended version of Forge is installed automatically. If you want to force a specific Forge to be used,
you can do
```
mcdex pack.create mypack 1.11.2 13.20.1.2386
```

As before, since we passed a non-absolute filename - 'mypack' - the pack will be created under the Minecraft home directory. 
If we wanted to create the modpack in our home directory (on OSX), we would do:

```
mcdex pack.create /Users/dizzyd/mypack 1.11.2
```

```pack.create``` will create the directory, make sure the appropriate version of Forge is installed and start a manifest.json. 
In addition, it will create an entry in the Minecraft launcher so you can launch the pack.

## Installing individual mods

Once you have a modpack, either installed from CurseForge or one you created locally, you can add individual mods to it. Let's
add [Immersive Engineering](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-engineering) to our new pack:

```
mcdex mod.select mypack immersive-engineering
```

This will search the database of mods for one named 'immersive-engineering' and find the most recent stable version and
add it to the pack's manifest.jason. To actually install the mod, you need to install the pack:

```
mcdex pack.install mypack
```

## Listing available mods

If you want to find all the mods with 'Map' in the name, you can do:

```
mcdex mod.list Map
```

Alternatively, if you want to only look for mods with 'Map' that work on 1.10.2, you can do:

```
mcdex mod.list Map 1.10.2
```

## Updating mods within a pack

If you want to update all the mods within a pack, you can now run:

```
mcdex mod.update.all mypack
```

This will walk over all the installed mods within a manifest and look for more recent versions of the mod that work with your selected version of minecraft.
It will list all the affected mods as it runs, so you can see exactly what changed. If you want to make sure a mod doesn't get updated, in the manifest.json
you can add a ""locked"": true entry to that mod and mcdex will not upgrade it.

Note that you can also run this command with a -n flag (dry run) so that it will simply print out the mods that were 
updated without actually updating the manifest.

Once you've updated the manifest with mod.update.all, you need to re-install the pack to make sure the new mods are updated:

```
mcdex pack.install mypack
```

869,rokups/hello-vue-django,Python,"# hello-vue + Django

This is a boilerplate project for using vuejs with Django.

### Features

* Django backend in `./backend`
* vuejs (v2) frontend in `./frontend`
* Hot-reload with vue-loader
* eslint linter integration
* Makefile to make your life easy


### Development environment setup

These steps will install all required dependencies including development ones, run migrations and start dev server.

```bash
make dev
make migrate
make run
```

### Deployment

These steps will install production dependencies and build vuejs application to `static/dist` folder.

```bash
make prod
make build
```

### Be aware

For the sake of simplicity Django config is contained within its own backend app. In real world setting you would
probably want to remove `backend` from `INSTALLED_APPS`, create a new app and move `backend.views` to it.

You probably want to create python virtual environment as well. Default python instance available will be used.

The last ""full release"" of GameSense was v2.3.0, which can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/IUDevman/gamesense-client/releases/tag/2.3.0) page or as an actions build. A ""development release"" can also be [downloaded](https://github.com/IUDevman/gamesense-client/releases/tag/d2.3.1) and the source can be viewed in the [d2.3.1](https://github.com/IUDevman/gamesense-client/tree/d2.3.1) branch.

The discord can still be joined [here](https://discord.gg/xfgPw63), however no support will be given but things such as a usage tutorial and configurations are still up. Several people have made continuations of the client, public and private, which are not affiliated with this main repo or myself, IUDevman. If you're looking for a client that is still being actively developed, I recommend [Cosmos](https://github.com/linustouchtips/cosmos).

872,MCDReforged/MinecraftDataAPI,Python,"# Minecraft Data API
-------------

[中文](https://github.com/MCDReforged/MinecraftDataAPI/blob/master/README_cn.md)

A MCDReforged api plugin to get player data information and more

## Dependency

- `hjson` module

## Usage

Use `server.get_plugin_instance()` to get the MinecraftDataAPI instance

```python
api = server.get_plugin_instance('minecraft_data_api')
```

You can declare the dependency of this plugin in PLUGIN_METADATA:

```python
PLUGIN_METADATA = {
	'dependencies': {
		'minecraft_data_api': '*',
	}
}
```

## Function list

Check the sample plugin in the `examples` folder or read the code to get a more comprehensive understanding

### convert_minecraft_json

```python
def convert_minecraft_json(text: str)
```

Convert Minecraft style json format into a python object

Minecraft style json format is something like these:

- `Steve has the following entity data: [-227.5d, 64.0d, 12.3E4d]`
- `[-227.5d, 64.0d, 231.5d]`
- `Alex has the following entity data: {HurtByTimestamp: 0, SleepTimer: 0s, ..., Inventory: [], foodTickTimer: 0}`

It will automatically detect if there is a `<name> has the following entity data: `. If there is, it will erase it before converting

Args:
- text: A data get entity or other command result that use Minecraft style json format

Return:
- A parsed json result. It can be a `dict`, a `list` or an `int`

Samples:

- Input `Steve has the following entity data: [-227.5d, 64.0d, 231.5d]`, output `[-227.5, 64.0, 123000.0]`

- Input `{HurtByTimestamp: 0, SleepTimer: 0s, Inventory: [], foodTickTimer: 0}`, output `{'HurtByTimestamp': 0, 'SleepTimer': 0, 'Inventory': [], 'foodTickTimer': 0}`

### get_player_info

```python
def get_player_info(player: str, data_path: str = '', *, timeout: Optional[float] = None)
```

Execute `data get entity <name> [<path>]` and parse the result

Args:
- name: Name of the player who you want to get his/her info
- path: An optional `path` parameter in `data get entity` command
- timeout: The maximum time to wait the data result. Return `None` if time out. Default value `5`

Return:
- A parsed json result. It can be a `dict`, a `list`, a `int` or a `None`

Please refer to the Player.dat page on minecraft wiki

[player.dat format](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Player.dat_format)

### get_player_coordinate

```python
def get_player_coordinate(player: str, *, timeout: Optional[float] = None) -> Union[int or str]
```

Use `get_player_info` to query the `Pos` data of the player to get the player's coordinate. A `ValueError` will be risen if query failed

It will convert the return value into a named tuple `collections.namedtuple('Coordinate', 'x y z')` for easier use of the return value

### get_player_dimension

```
def get_player_dimension(player: str, *, timeout: Optional[float] = None) -> Union[int or str]
```

Use `get_player_info` to query the `Dimension` data of the player to get the player's dimension. A `ValueError` will be risen if query failed

It contains a dimension data convert. It will convert the dimension name in MC 1.16+ (e.g. `minecraft:overworld`) into the related integer

Dimension name mapping:

```python
dim_convert = {
    'minecraft:overworld': 0,
    'minecraft:the_nether': -1,
    'minecraft:the_end': 1
}
```

If the dimension it gets is not in the mapping, for example it's a custom dimension, then it will return the name of the dimension directly

### get_dimension_translation_text

```
def get_dimension_translation_text(dim_id: int) -> RText
```

Convert the dimension id into a RTextTranslation object that can be translated by Minecraft. The mapping of the translation key is as follows

```python
dimension_translation = {
    0: 'createWorld.customize.preset.overworld',
    -1: 'advancements.nether.root.title',
    1: 'advancements.end.root.title'
}
```

If the dimension id is not in the mapping, it will return a RText object contains the input id directly

You can safely use `api.get_dimension_translation_text(api.get_player_dimension('Steve'))` to get text component storing the dimension the player is in

### get_server_player_list

```python
def get_server_player_list(*, timeout: Optional[float] = None) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, List[str]]]
```

Return the player list information by executing /list command

The return value is a tuple with 3 element: the amount of current player, the player limit, and a list of names of online players. Return None if querying failed

See `examples/PlayerList.py` for example usage
"
873,WesJD/AnvilGUI,Java,"# AnvilGUI [![Build Status](https://ci.codemc.io/job/WesJD/job/AnvilGUI/badge/icon)](https://ci.codemc.io/job/WesJD/job/AnvilGUI/)
AnvilGUI is a library to capture user input in Minecraft through an anvil inventory. Anvil inventories within the realm
of the Minecraft / Bukkit / Spigot / Paper API are extremely finnicky and ultimately don't support the ability to use them fully for
the task of user input. As a result, the only way to achieve user input with an anvil inventory requires interaction with obfuscated,
decompiled code. AnvilGUI provides a straightforward, versatile, and easy-to-use solution without having your project
depend on version specific code. 

## Requirements
Java 8 and Bukkit / Spigot. Most server versions in the [Spigot Repository](https://hub.spigotmc.org/nexus/) are supported.

### My version isn't supported
If you are a developer, submit a pull request adding a wrapper module for your version. Otherwise, please create an issue
on the issues tab. 

## Usage

### As a dependency

AnvilGUI requires the usage of Maven or a Maven compatible build system. 
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.wesjd</groupId>
    <artifactId>anvilgui</artifactId>
    <version>1.6.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
    <id>codemc-snapshots</id>
    <url>https://repo.codemc.io/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
</repository>
```

It is best to be a good citizen and relocate the dependency to within your namespace in order 
to prevent conflicts with other plugins. Here is an example of how to relocate the dependency:
```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>

            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```
Note: In order to solve `<minimizeJar>` removing AnvilGUI `VerionWrapper`s from the final jar and making the library unusable,
ensure that your `<filters>` section contains the example `<filter>` as seen above.

### In your plugin

The `AnvilGUI.Builder` class is how you build an AnvilGUI. 
The following methods allow you to modify various parts of the displayed GUI. Javadocs are available [here](http://docs.wesjd.net/AnvilGUI/).

#### `onClose(Consumer<Player>)` 
Takes a `Consumer<Player>` argument that is called when a player closes the anvil gui.
```java                                             
builder.onClose(player -> {                         
    player.sendMessage(""You closed the inventory."");
});                                                 
``` 

#### `onComplete(Function<AnvilGUI.Completion, AnvilGUI.Response>)`
Takes a `Function<AnvilGUI.Completion, List<AnvilGUI.ResponseAction>>` as argument. The function is called when a player clicks the output slot.
The supplied `Completion` contains the player who clicked, the inputted text, the left item, right item and the output. You must return a `List<AnvilGUI.ResponseAction>`,
which could include:
- Closing the inventory (`AnvilGUI.ResponseAction.close()`)
- Replacing the input text (`AnvilGUI.ResponseAction.replaceInputText(String)`)
- Opening another inventory (`AnvilGUI.ResponseAction.openInventory(Inventory)`)
- Running generic code (`AnvilGUI.ResponseAction.close(Runnable)`)

The list of actions are ran in the order they are supplied.
```java                                                
builder.onComplete((completion) -> {                 
    if(completion.getText().equalsIgnoreCase(""you"")) {
        completion.getPlayer().sendMessage(""You have magical powers!"");
        return Arrays.asList(AnvilGUI.ResponseAction.close());              
    } else {                                           
        return Arrays.asList(AnvilGUI.ResponseAction.replaceInputText(""Try again""));   
    }                                                  
});                                                    
```

#### `interactableSlots(int... slots)`
This allows or denies users to take / input items in the anvil slots that are provided. This feature is useful when you try to make a inputting system using an anvil gui.
```java
builder.interactableSlots(Slot.INPUT_LEFT, Slot.INPUT_RIGHT);
```

#### `preventClose()` 
Tells the AnvilGUI to prevent the user from pressing escape to close the inventory.
Useful for situations like password input to play.                                      
```java                     
builder.preventClose();     
```                     
     
#### `text(String)`
Takes a `String` that contains what the initial text in the renaming field should be set to.
```java                                           
builder.text(""What is the meaning of life?"");     
```  

#### `itemLeft(ItemStack)`
Takes a custom `ItemStack` to be placed in the left input slot.
```java                                              
ItemStack stack = new ItemStack(Material.IRON_SWORD);
ItemMeta meta = stack.getItemMeta();                 
meta.setLore(Arrays.asList(""Sharp iron sword""));             
stack.setItemMeta(meta); 
builder.itemLeft(stack);        
```         

#### `onLeftInputClick(Consumer<Player>)`
Takes a `Consumer<Player>` to be executed when the item in the left input slot is clicked.
```java                                              
builder.onLeftInputClick(player -> {
    player.sendMessage(""You clicked the left input slot!"");
});        
```      

#### `itemRight(ItemStack)`
Takes a custom `ItemStack` to be placed in the right input slot.
```java                                              
ItemStack stack = new ItemStack(Material.IRON_INGOT);
ItemMeta meta = stack.getItemMeta();                 
meta.setLore(Arrays.asList(""A piece of metal""));             
stack.setItemMeta(meta); 
builder.itemRight(stack);        
```         

#### `onRightInputClick(Consumer<Player>)`
Takes a `Consumer<Player>` to be executed when the item in the right input slot is clicked.
```java                                              
builder.onRightInputClick(player -> {
    player.sendMessage(""You clicked the right input slot!"");
});        
```

#### `title(String)`
Takes a `String` that will be used as the inventory title. Only displayed in Minecraft 1.14 and above.
```java                            
builder.title(""Enter your answer"");
```                                
                 
#### `plugin(Plugin)`
Takes the `Plugin` object that is making this anvil gui. It is needed to register listeners.
```java                                         
builder.plugin(pluginInstance);                 
```                            

#### `open(Player)`
Takes a `Player` that the anvil gui should be opened for. This method can be called multiple times without needing to create
a new `AnvilGUI.Builder` object.                                                                                            
```java              
builder.open(player);
```                  

### A full example combining all methods
```java
new AnvilGUI.Builder()
    .onClose(player -> {                                               //called when the inventory is closing
        player.sendMessage(""You closed the inventory."");
    })
    .onComplete((completion) -> {                                    //called when the inventory output slot is clicked
        if(completion.getText().equalsIgnoreCase(""you"")) {
            completion.getPlayer().sendMessage(""You have magical powers!"");
            return Arrays.asList(AnvilGUI.ResponseAction.close());
        } else {
            return Arrays.asList(AnvilGUI.ResponseAction.replaceInputText(""Try again""));
        }
    })
    .preventClose()                                                    //prevents the inventory from being closed
    .interactableSlots(Slot.INPUT_RIGHT)                               //allow player to take out and replace the right input item
    .text(""What is the meaning of life?"")                              //sets the text the GUI should start with
    .itemLeft(new ItemStack(Material.IRON_SWORD))                      //use a custom item for the first slot
    .itemRight(new ItemStack(Material.IRON_SWORD))                     //use a custom item for the second slot
    .onLeftInputClick(player -> player.sendMessage(""first sword""))     //called when the left input slot is clicked
    .onRightInputClick(player -> player.sendMessage(""second sword""))   //called when the right input slot is clicked
    .title(""Enter your answer."")                                       //set the title of the GUI (only works in 1.14+)
    .plugin(myPluginInstance)                                          //set the plugin instance
    .open(myPlayer);                                                   //opens the GUI for the player provided
```

Terrarium adds a new customizable world type that generates a replica of the Earth within Minecraft.

![Himalayas](https://i.imgur.com/q8tXfC3.png)
_Himalayas, as generated by Terrarium (rendered by Chunky)_

## Usage
Terrarium implements a new world type for this generation. The generation can be customized through a GUI, to adjust settings such as scale or what should generate.

![Customization GUI](https://i.imgur.com/5UpsVpA.png)

GIS data is downloaded as you explore the world, so, depending on internet speed, you may experience lag while this data downloads. The mod does its best to counteract this lag, however. Once a part of the dataset is downloaded, it is cached locally so that it can be loaded again quickly in the future.

To navigate to any real-world location, you can make use of the `geotp` command:

It can be used with latitude & longitude coordinates:
 - `/geotp 27.987746 86.924812`
 
Or it can be used with a place name:
 - `/geotp Mount Everest`
 
Additionally, you can make use of the `geotool` command, which provides various utilities for navigating the world. It provides a UI to display where you currently are, and a UI to teleport to a new location with a map.

## Data Attribution
Terrarium makes use of a large range of data sources which have been reprocessed for the purpose of this mod:

877,fador/mineserver,C++,"# Mineserver
*by Fador & Nredor and others*

Custom Minecraft server software written in C++.

You can find the core team from [#mineserver](https://web.libera.chat/#mineserver) in [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) IRC network. Also mail to developers@mineserver.be will reach us.

    Copyright (c) 2010-2016, The Mineserver Project

**NOTICE:** Server still lacks features compared to original minecraft server.


**Supported platforms**

 * Linux (CMake)
 * Windows (VS2013 project included, CMake not tested)
 
Server has also been tested to build on Mac OS X and FreeBSD/PCBSD but we do not officially support those.

We are trying to minimize memory and CPU usage compared to original Java server.

*Important:* The language is C++11, so you will need a reasonably modern
C++ compiler. MS Visual C++ 12 and GCC 4.8 should be sufficient. The build system requires [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/).


### Supported Minecraft version

 * Working with 1.8.9 client (protocol 47)

### Features

 * Plugins (chatcommands, filelog, nether, passivemobs, etc..)
 * NBT parsing/saving
 * Lightmap generation
 * Config file
 * Normal mining/item spawning/item pickups
 * Basic physics for gravel and sand
 * Physics for water (currently revising this)
 * Flatland and terrain map generation (Also biomegen!)
 * Working chests, furnaces & signs
 * User validation from minecraft.net
 * Protocol Encryption

### Configuration Notes

An example `config.cfg` file is located in the `files` subdirectory.

The config file sets three path names and one file name which are relevant to the server; with their example values they are:

    system.path.data    = ""files"";
    system.path.plugins = ""plugins"";
    system.path.home    = ""."";
    system.pid_file     = ""mineserver.pid"";

These paths may be either absolute or relative. The server requires a set of configuration files which are located in the `files` subdirectory
of the distribution. 

The plugin binaries must be manually placed in the appropriate location for the server to find them.


### Bug Tracker / To Do / Roadmap

We use GitHub issue tracker and milestones.
Please check the wiki pages for details about the project status and development plans.
Check the [fork network](https://github.com/fador/mineserver/network) for the latest development status.

### Compiling

Mineserver requires the following libraries:

 * [zlib 1.2.5](http://www.zlib.org)
 * [libevent 2.0.x](http://libevent.org/)
 * [libnoise 1.0](http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/)
 * [openssl/libssl](http://www.openssl.org/)
 * [pthread](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads)

 * Installing on Debian and Ubuntu:

    `sudo apt-get install libssl libssl-dev libevent-2.0 libevent-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libnoise-dev`

 * Installing on CentOS and RHEL

    `# Install EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)`
    `sudo su -c 'rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm'`
    `sudo yum install git libevent libevent-devel zlib zlib-devel libnoise-dev`

 * Installing on FreeBSD / PCBSD

    `sudo pkg_add -r libevent`

 * Installing on Mac OS X
    * Install libevent using your favourite tool, e.g., homebrew, fink or macports.
    * Installing libnoise can be painful. Howerver, there is a homebrew formular
      on [krono's homebrew fork](http://github.com/krono/homebrew).

    So for homebrew do

    `brew install libevent libnoise`


**Compiling using Linux (cmake & make & g++):**

 * Download and extract source or use `git clone git://github.com/fador/mineserver.git`
 * Go to mineserver directory
 * Run `cmake .`
 * Run `make all`
 * Run server with `cd bin && ./mineserver`

**Compiling using FreeBSD / PCBSD (cmake & gmake & g++):**

 * Download and extract source or use `git clone git://github.com/fador/mineserver.git`
 * Go to mineserver directory
 * Run `cmake .`
 * Run `gmake all`
 * Run server with `cd bin && ./mineserver`

**Compiling using Windows (VS2013): (Might be outdated)**

 * Download and compile [zlib](http://www.zlib.org) or use [pre-built binaries](http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/index.html)
 * Add zlib libraries to project (zlibstat.lib or zlibwapi.lib which requires also zlibwapi.dll in the same dir with the executable)
 * Download and compile [libevent 2.0.x](http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/)
 * Download [libnoise 1.0](http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/) and add header/library files to project
 * Add libevent library to project (libevent2.lib)
 * Build
 * Run mineserver.exe
 
 * [Build Pack](http://mineserver.be/downloads/mineserver-VS2013_build_pack.zip) also available for easy compiling

 An example using commandline compiler available at http://www.microsoft.com/express/Windows/ Please change the ZLIB_INC_DIR, LIBEVENT_INC_DIR, ZLIB_LIB_DIR and LIBEVENT_LIB_DIR to those you keep the includes/libs.

    call ""%VS120COMNTOOLS%vsvars32.bat""

wgpu-mc is a standalone, mostly-batteries-included rendering engine written in Rust.
Electrum is a fabric mod that integrates wgpu-mc with Minecraft.

#### Current status

Both the engine and Electrum are both currently under active development.
wgpu-mc is fairly mature, while Electrum needs more development. The whole project is 
WIP, so something may work one day then be rewritten the next.
Terrain rendering works somewhat, while entities are still entirely un-integrated in Electrum.
A publicly testable release of the mod should be out Soonish.

881,Choonster-Minecraft-Mods/MinecraftModDecompiler,Java,"# Discontinued
This project has been discontinued. I recommend using [BON2](https://github.com/tterrag1098/BON2) to deobfuscate mods and a regular Java decompiler to decompile them.

# Minecraft Mod Decompiler
Decompiles and deobfuscates all Minecraft Forge mods in a specified directory and outputs the source files to another directory.

Please respect the individual mod licenses when using this tool.

## Supported Platforms
This tool uses [JD-Core-java](https://github.com/nviennot/jd-core-java) for decompilation.

JD itself supports:
- Linux 32/64-bit
- Windows 32/64-bit
- Mac OSX 32/64-bit on x86 hardware

## Build
Clone the repository and run `gradlew build`. This will generate two JAR files in the `build/libs` directory:
- `MinecraftModDecompiler-<version>.jar`, which contains only this tool
- `MinecraftModDecompiler-<version>-withdeps.jar`, which contains this tool and all of its dependencies

The `idea` and `eclipse` Gradle plugins are included in the build script, so you can run `gradlew idea` or `gradlew eclipse` to generate an IDE project.

## Usage
```shell
java -jar MinecraftModDecompiler.jar [options]
  Options:
  * -mappingsDirectory
       The directory containing the MCP mapping files (fields.csv and methods.csv)
  * -modDirectory
       The directory containing the mods to decompile
  * -outputDirectory
       The directory to output the decompiled classes to
```

For convenience, the included `MCModDecompiler` batch/shell scripts can be run with the same arguments after building in a cloned repository.

The MCP mapping files can be found in the [MCP releases](http://www.modcoderpack.com/website/releases) under the `conf` directory. If you've set up a ForgeGrqadle workspace, you can also find the mapping files in your Gradle cache (`~/.gradle/caches/minecraft/net/minecraftforge/forge/<forge_version>/unpacked/conf` for Minecraft 1.7.2 and later).

## License
MinecraftModDecompiler is released under the MIT license. See `LICENSE.txt` for details.

JD-IntelliJ (included with JD-Core-java) is free for non-commercial use. This means that JD-IntelliJ shall not be included or embedded into commercial software products. Nevertheless, this tool may be freely used for personal needs in a commercial or non-commercial environments.

885,amalbansode/Discord-Minecraft-Bot,JavaScript,"# Discord Minecraft Bot


## Introduction
This is a Node.js script for a Discord bot. Based on [MineStat](https://github.com/ldilley/minestat), the bot checks the status of user-specified Minecraft servers and returns the number of players online.

## Installation
This requires Node.js to be installed on your system, along with primary dependencies discord.js and minestat.js.

### Setting up for use with Node.js
1. Install Node.js and npm on your system. (You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) binary.)
2. Clone this repository and place it in a folder. (Use `git clone https://github.com/amalbansode/Minecraft-Discord-Bot`)
2. In terminal, navigate to this folder.
	```bash
	$ cd location/of/your/Minecraft-Discord-Bot
	```
3. Install the latest `discord.js` using npm.
	```bash
	$ npm i -S discord.js # You can remove the -S because npm now automatically saves it to package.json
	```

### Setting up a Discord Application
1. [Create a Discord Application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) for the purpose of this bot. Setup a Discord account if you do not have one yet.
2. Give the application/bot a name and description.
3. Navigate to the ‘Bot’ section. Reveal your bot’s token, and copy it.
4. Open `auth.json`, which is contained in the same folder as `bot.js`.
5. Paste your token within the double quotes corresponding to the ""token"" key, and save `auth.json`.
6. Now, with Terminal open in the same directory as before, run
	```bash
	$ node bot.js
	```
7. The output should say the following. If so, you have setup the bot correctly.
	```
	Logged in as <your bot’s discord tag>!
	Ready...
	```
8. Exit the application using a keyboard escape (typically `control/command + C`).

### Adding the bot to a server
1. On the [Dicord Chat Client](https://discordapp.com/channels/), click the '+' icon on the left side and create a new server for testing the bot. Skip this step if you manage a pre-existing server you want the bot to be added to.
2. On the Discord Develper Portal for your bot, navigate to the section titled ‘OAuth2’. Scroll down to view the OAuth2 URL Generator.
3. Check the following boxes: 
	* In Scopes, _bot_
	* In Bot Permissions, _Send Messages_ and _Read Message History_
4. A URL must have been generated above. Follow this URL in a new browser tab.
5. Specify the server you would like to add the bot to (this could be the one you created in step 1, or a pre-existing server).
6. Verify the permissions stated, and click ‘Authorize’.
7. The bot should now be a member of your specified server.
8. Start the bot in Terminal again
	```bash
	$ node bot.js
	```
9. In the Discord chat window for this server, enter ‘!ip’ and check for output in your Discord chat.

## Features

### Player count display
The number of players on the server is displayed as the bot’s activity in the ‘Users‘ list on the right side.

![Discord Bot Activity shows player count](/images/discord_activity.png)

### Printing the list of server IPs in chat
The IP details of servers can be displayed in Discord chat by typing `!ip` into Discord chat. The bot will reply to the user invoking the command.

![Discord Bot replies with list of IPs to servers](/images/discord_reply.png)

## Configuration

### Changing the servers to be checked
1. Stop the bot if it is running. Open `bot.js` in a text-editing program.
2. Navigate to line _33_, which contains the dictionary type variable `servIP`.
3. By default, the dictionary contains the IP Address for the MInecraft Hypixel server.
	```javascript
	const servIP = {
	    hypixel: 'mc.hypixel.net:25565',
	    // 'your title': 'your.ip:port',
	};
	```
4. Modify this dictionary to follow the template, keeping the title(s) and IP Address(es) within single quotation (') marks, separated by a colon (:) mark. The order of servers in this dictionary list will be preserved in the bot’s output.

### Changing the frequency of checking servers' status
1. By default, the bot checks the status of servers every four minutes.
2. To modify this, change the variable `refreshEvery` on line _29_ to the number of minutes between every refresh. Use a floating point numeral if required.

Note: The bot being asynchronous, however, will require at least `the number of servers times 2.5` seconds to fetch the statuses of all servers at once. This time interval can be reduced, but it is suggested that this remain as it is to prevent any malfunctioning.

## FAQs
**There's no port specified for my Minecraft server**

The standard port for Minecraft servers is typically _25565_.

**Does the bot run forever?**

No, the bot goes offline when you close Terminal or end the process on your system. You could host the bot on AWS or Heroku, following the same steps as above, instead. The bot can be kept online using the _forever_ module. Check out [this guide](https://shiffman.net/a2z/bot-ec2/) on the usage of AWS.

## Introduction

Real-time raytracing has spurred the development of faster rendering techniques to achieve high-quality graphics without dramatically affecting game performance. One topic of study includes real-time global illumination: a recent paper by Majercik, et. al (2019) details a method of approximating indirect lighting, with information updated at every frame based on dynamic lighting and moving scene geometry. The paper, [*Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination with Ray-Traced Irradiance Fields*](http://jcgt.org/published/0008/02/01/paper-lowres.pdf), is the focus of our project; we aim to implement the algorihm described, while generating our own Minecraft-inspired scenes to test its efficacy in real-time. (We are inspired by a shared interest in Minecraft.)

## Credits

Due to hardware limitations, our team could not take advantage of the Vulkan raytracing extension. Thus, our code is based on the Realtime Vulkan Path Tracer (RVPT) developed [here](https://github.com/GraphicsProgramming/RVPT/), which relies on compute shaders to raytrace scenes. Without this, our Vulkan framework would have taken much longer to setup from scratch.

## Build Instructions

Requires:
 * C++17 compiler
 * CMake version 3.11 or higher
 * Vulkan SDK installed. Download here: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home

CMake is the build system. 
Basic compilation instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/helenl9098/ddgi_minecraft.git
cd ddgi_minecraft
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
```
This will create the rvpt executable in the build directory. It requires the assets folder to operate currently.

Run the `rvpt` solution file that was produced using visual studios with rvpt as your start-up project.
## Walkthrough

Here we lay out our interpretation of the paper and our implementation details.

### Light Field Probes

To approximate global illumination at points in a scene, we can utilize *light field probes* as described in [*Real-Time Global Illumination using Precomputed Light Field Probes*
](http://casual-effects.com/research/McGuire2017LightField/McGuire2017LightField.pdf) by McGuire et. al (2017). These probes conceptually are spheres dispersed throughout a scene in a grid-based *irradiance field*. This field can be made up of an arbitrary number of probes, but ideally it encapsulates all objects in the scene.

The implementation of these probes in Majercik et. al's paper differs from the McGuire et. al implementation. Before the scene is raytraced, each of the *m* probes sends out *n* rays that potentially intersect with the scene. We find the irradiance value at those intersections, i.e. the direct and indirect lighting at that point, and we also record the distance from the originating probe to that intersection. This information is stored in a texture; each pixel corresponds to a ray from a probe, and the pixels corresponding to one probe are packed together.

| ![](/img/cornell/cornell_texture.PNG) |
| ------------------------------------- |
| An example of the probe ray texture, derived from the Cornell box scene. Each oblong ""cell"" of pixels corresponds to a probe in the scene.|

### Sampling Probes

After the probes collect their data, the scene is raytraced in a compute shader and rendered to an image on the screen. For every ray that finds an intersection in the scene, we first find the direct lighting at that point. Then, we identify the eight closest probes to that point in the scene. The grid-based structure of the irradiance field allows every point in the scene to be encapsulated in some *probe cage*—a set of eight probes that form a cube surrounding the point.

| ![](/img/probe_cage.PNG)                                      | ![](/img/cornell/probe_vicinity_debug.PNG)                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A figure depicting the eight probes around a pixel on the green triangle, taken from the paper. | A debug view of the probe indices that correspond to pixels in the scene. The color corresponds to the index of the bottom, front, leftmost probe in the cage surrounding each pixel. |

Once the probe cage has been determined, we iterate over every probe in the cage and sample the light that the probe sees for that point. More specifically, we get the normal at the point of intersection and find its corresponding pixel in our texture in order to get the indirect lighting data from a probe ray that aligns closely with the direction's normal. In this way, we treat the probe as see-through; we get the irradiance that the probe sees in that direction, then add that to the total irradiance at that point. 

### Weights ###

The paper describes various methods to ensure that the indirect lighting appears to be continuous and accounts for dynamic geometry and lights. Majercik et. al uses the following weights to blend information from the 8 closest probes per intersection:
- The *smooth backface weight* culls indirect contribution by excluding probes that are not mutually visible to the point of intersection.
- The *trilinear adjacency weight* interpolates lighting contribution based on the distance between every probe.
- The *Chebyshev visibility test* (a.k.a. variance shadow mapping) is a technique that counters shadow aliasing by approximating how shadows soften at shadow edges.
- The *log perception weight* counters human sensitivity to contrast in low-light conditions by scaling down dimly lit intersections. It makes light leaks less apparent to the viewer.

These were implemented as described in the paper, using their supplemental code as reference. However, the Chebyshev visibility test gave us undesirable artifacts, so we have chosen not to include it in our weight calculations.

### Scene Generation

To test the real-time efficacy of our DDGI implementation, we procedurally generated a Minecraft-inspired mushroom caves scene; This scene contains a hallowed out cave with openings to the surface and various large mushroom types growing from the ground. The hallowed cave is constructed from a union of different sphere signed distance functions (SDFs), and the floor of the cave is diversified using a fractal brownian noise. As for the mushrooms, there are 4 variations, each made from a different rounded rectangular prism SDF. The mushrooms are strategically placed in the scene so we can utilize bounding box checks to achieve faster a runtime. 

The block textures were also procedurally generated using the UVs at the point of intersection, which we calculated using the intersection position and normal. Using the UVs and intersection position, we were able to generate vertical stripes, dots, and other textures for our scene. 

| ![](/img/empty_cave.png)                                      | ![](/img/mushroom_close.png)                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Our textured cave scene without any mushroom, lit using DDGI. | A closer look at one of our mushrooms & textures lit using DDGI. |

When raytracing the scene, we used grid marching in order to find the point of intersection. Grid marching involves traversing down a ray in increments of the smallest distance to the next block, essentially checking every grid block that a ray passes through. At each grid block, we would get its block type based on our procedural scene, and continue marching down the ray if the block type is empty. 

In order to further optimize our program, Majercik, et. al (2019) suggests to use deferred shading. However, due to our use of grid marching to find ray intersections, there was no need to implement deferred shading. Since grid marching returns the closest intersection point to the camera, we only made lighting calculations for that single fragment as opposed to all fragments within a particular pixel like in forward rendering. Similar to deferred shading, the rendering time is independent of the amount of geometry in the scene and is instead only dependent on the number of lights and screen resolution. Thus the runtime is O(num_lights * num_pixels). Also note that grid marching is affected by the structure of the geometry due to the use of signed distance functions to represent the geometry and traverse along a ray. Despite this limitation our program still runs at a decent frame rate, but grid marching could become a potential bottleneck within other scenes.

## Dynamic Lights

Once we were sure that our program worked with a single, static light we added support for multiple, dynamic lights. The direct lighting with multiple lights is computed by averaging the direct contribution of each non-occluded light. Since indirect lighting is simply a series of accumulated direct lighting calculations, the aforementioned direct lighting calculation can be used multiple times in indirect lighting. 

To animate the lights, we update the positions of the lights every frame in our compute shaders using the elapsed time and trigonometric functions for periodic motion. For more interesting scenes, we added a light color and intensity to every light. The indirect lighting responds to the dynamic lights through the frame-by-frame update of the probe textures. Consequently, the direct and indirect lighting of every intersection responds to the changing lights in real-time.

This approach does have a drawback in that the frame rate drops significantly with multiple lights. We suspect that this slow down is caused by the additional work necessary to compute the direct lighting for each light. Direct lighting computation would thus become a greater issue in the indirect lighting computation since it is the accumulation of multiple direct lighting calculations.

## Performance Analysis

The base code we used for this project came with a built-in FPS counter that displays in the top left corner of the screen. To gauge the performance of our project, we relied on this counter and took an informal estimate of the frames per second. This involved eyeballing the range of values that the counter reached within fifteen seconds, then taking the average of these values and recording it for analysis.

**Important to note:** because we generate the scene with implicit shapes (which requires us to march along rays from the camera into the scene), the FPS will vary based on how close the camera is to visible geometry. For consistency, we attempt to measure FPS from the same camera position for each scene, but the FPS will fluctuate depending on what is in view at any given moment.

In this analysis, we look over these varying parameters and compare the results, both quantitative and qualitiative, of our project.
 - probe-ray count
 - probe distance and placement
 - probe number and density
 - procedural textures
 - number of lights
 - dynamic vs. static lights

Wee use the following parameters for the cave and Cornell scenes unless otherwise specified.

| | Cave   | Cornell |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Probe Dimensions     | (9, 7, 9)     | (5, 5, 5)     |
| Probe Distance      | 11     | 6   |
| Field Origin      | (1.4, 0, 1.0)     | (0, 0, 15)     |

### Number of Rays per Probe

Each probe sends out the same number of rays into the scene. Increasing this number will increase it across the entire irradiance field, and will also lead to an increased probe texture size. Therefore, sending more rays per probe requires more bandwidth and potentially more computational time between the probe-data shader and the raytracing shaders. This is supported by our observations of the FPS counter as we added in more probe rays.

![](/img/charts/fps_probe_rays_cave.png) 

![](/img/charts/fps_probe_rays_cornell.png)

However, it is not enough to say that the less rays there are, the better the performance. A minimum threshold of rays is required for accurate results. Having less rays of probe information leads to different irradiance results.

| ![](/img/cave/indirect_cave_num_rays_16.PNG) | ![](/img/cave/indirect_cave_num_rays_144.PNG) | ![](/img/cave/indirect_cave_num_rays_1600.PNG) |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 16 rays per probe | 144 rays per probe | 1600 rays per probe|

Therefore, there is a tradeoff between the performance and the accuracy of the probes, and the balance of both depends on what the viewer deems as the best quality results. Although we found 400 rays per probe an acceptable standard, in other applications the parameter may have to be tweaked from scene to scene.

### Probe Distance

The distance between probes in the field impacts two parts of the shading process. It affects the positions of the probes, and therefore what points the irradiance is sampled from, and it also affects the Chebvyshev weight that we assign to a probe's irradiance, since it relies on the distance from the point to the probe. However, we have disabled Chebvyshev weighting due to unwanted artifacts, so modifying the distance between probes in the irradiance field mainly modifies the results of the probe texture.

| ![](/img/cornell/indirect_probe_dist_6.PNG) | ![](/img/cornell/indirect_probe_dist_8.PNG) | ![](/img/cornell/indirect_probe_dist_10.PNG) |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| probe distance: 6| probe distance: 8 | probe distance: 10|

Here we demonstrate the variance in indirect lighting, based on change to the distance between probes in the irradiance field. (The size of the irradiance field itself has not changed.) Clearly, the placement of the probes throughout the scene is significant; beyond some probes being obsecured, the distance between the probes causes the lighting information itself to be more spread out, and potentially less accurate. However, increasing the distance of the probes can reduce the need to light the scene with more probes, which may be a desired tradeoff. Since this parameter has a completely qualitative measure, it's up to the viewer to determine what probe distance is appropriate for the scene, especially in combination with the number of probes.

### Number of Probes

While increasing the number of rays per probe can result in more lighting information, so can increasing the number of probes themselves. The irradiance field can be expanded in all three directions, and the distance between probes can be modified so that the field is more sparse or dense. We explored four different sets of parameters for both the cave and Cornell scenes, as detailed below.

Quantitatively, the framerate drops the more probes that there are in the scene. This is because as the number of probes increase, the number of rays we shoot out increase. Furthermore, the probe texture's dimensions will also have to increase to accommodate for the additional probes. All these increases will lead to a drop in performance, which you can see below:

![](/img/charts/fps_num_probes_cave.png) 
![](/img/charts/fps_num_probes_cornell.png) 

Qualitatively, the results really varied as the probe density changes. Looking at the below images, we see that a greater number of probes (Layout 3) doesn't necessarily mean it's more accurate than a scene with less probes (Layout 1). Thus, we determined that the specific placement of probes is very important to the overall results. However, we can conclude looking at the below images that we are more likely to get more illumination with an increase of probes, but the exact results do vary. Note: Layout 2 was not shown because it was the default we tested against.

### Procedural Textures

Because we involve noise functions (e.g. Worley noise, fractional brownian motion) to texture our cave, we need additional time to compute the color of a block in that scene. These calculations take up a notable amount of time: if we remove procedural texturing and fill the cave with flat colors, the scene renders at about **75 FPS**, while our use of procedural textures results in **60 FPS**. A **15 FPS** difference is not insignificant at this framerate level.

### Number of Lights

Although our project intends to pull global illumination out of limited light sources, we wanted to test how the number of lights in the scene impacted quantitative performance. We expected the performance to go down with the addition of more lights because our direct lighting calculation relies on the total number of lights in the scene. Since this calculation is done for multiple bounces in the probe-data and raytracing shaders combined, the compute time from additional lights will accumulate. This is supported by our results for both the cave and Cornell box scenes.

![](/img/charts/fps_num_lights_cave.png)
![](/img/charts/fps_num_lights_cornell.png)

### Dynamic vs. Static Lights

We briefly tested how animating the lights affected performance, to see if it slowed it down terribly. For three lights in the Cornell scene, the framerate is at **250 FPS** for static and **220 FPS** for dynamic lights. However, for four lights in the cave scene, the framerate is at **29 FPS** for both static and dynamic lights. The actual calculation time should be consistent across scenes, so the discrepancy may result from their initial framerate levels; the Cornell box's framerate is more suspectible to change because of how high the framerate is already. Therefore, animating the lights may not impact the framerate as substantially as other parameters, at least for the cave scene. 



## Future Work

In the future, we would love to address the following features and concerns: 

- Additional Probe Placements
- Condensing Probe Textures for Less Memory Usage
- Faster Approaches to averaging texture pixels
- File-Loaded Textures
- Integration with Vulkan Path Tracing Extension
- More terrain generation for our Mini-Minecraft
- Interactable Blocks and Player Physics
- Glossy and Specular Reflections
- Volumetric Rendering
- Block Dynamics and Animation

## Disclaimers

By using this modpack, you agree to the following:

* The modpack has been set up to be compatible with the rules of most public third-party servers, but it is your responsibility to verify whether you are allowed to use it or not. By installing this modpack you agree that the modpack author, the mod developers and Mojang provide no warranties for using this modpack, every action you do with it is your own.   
    * The command *`/ghost`* (provided by [AntiGhost](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/antighost)) may be disallowed by the rules on some servers [as it sends a slight amount of packets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/antighost?comment=103), but it is safe if you don't spam it, use only when you are stuck in blocks.
* This modpack is using [Starlight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight) for chunk optimization and [due to the way it works](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md#chunk-save-format), disabling (or replacing) the mod will make your existing worlds initially load a bit slower. This is harmless, it simply means the game is calculating the lit up areas again with a different algorithm.
* This modpack disables the [third-party server disclaimer](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Multiplayer_disclaimer.png), so if you are using the multiplayer function, you also agree to the following: 
    > Caution: Online play is offered by third-party servers that are not owned, operated, or supervised by Mojang Studios or Microsoft. During online play, you may be exposed to unmoderated chat messages or other types of user-generated content that may not be suitable for everyone. 
    *  [The ""social interactions"" screen](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Social_Interactions_screen#Usage) can be used by pressing the key `P` in-game or the `Player Reporting` button in the pause menu.
    * On servers where Mojang's chat reporting is optional, the modpack opts out of it for the playing user. Chat status icons are changed to provide more accurate information about the signing state of the server. [Read more](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/chat-reporting-faq).
* Fabulously Optimized does not host any capes or other cosmetics, nor does it encourage users to buy them from any provider. Instead, the modpack encourages users to [prefer free cosmetics](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/free-cape), while also giving them options to use any paid cosmetics they've previously obtained from certain providers.  
* Yes, you can fork/remix this pack [according to the license](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/LICENSE.md). You cannot, however, use the ""Fabulously Optimized"" name or logo to _represent_ your fork (but you can mention that you forked it).

[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/kbroman/miner/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kbroman/miner/actions)

Following the python module
[py3minepi](https://github.com/py3minepi/py3minepi), this is an R package that allows
connection to the
[Minecraft API](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft-api-reference.html)
using [RaspberryJuice](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/raspberryjuice)
and either [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) or
[Minecraft:Pi](https://minecraft.net/en-us/edition/pi/).

The miner package provides a few simple functions to manipulate the
Minecraft world from R. The intent of this package is to encourage new
R users to learn R by writing scripts to do fun things in Minecraft.

See the online book, [R Programming with
Minecraft](https://kbroman.org/miner_book/), for details on
setting up a Minecraft server and using this package, and for a
variety of detailed examples. The package also contains a short
[vignette](vignettes/miner.Rmd) on its basic use.

Here are a few of the things you can do with
[miner](https://github.com/kbroman/miner):

### Write words on a hillside:

![](figure/rOpenSci_sign.png)

### Render a photograph as a wall of blocks:

![](figure/karthik_minecraft.png)

Or the [R](https://www.r-project.org) logo:

![](figure/Rlogo_minecraft.png)

### Generate a random maze in R, and create it in the world for players to explore:

![](figure/maze.gif)

![](figure/maze-minecraft.png)

This player is operated by a bot trying to find its way out of the maze via a rule-based algorithm:

![](figure/maze_bot.gif)

### Give the player the powers of Elsa:

[Freeze water as you run over it](https://youtu.be/6gcRyuj0smg)

[![](figure/elsa-animated.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gcRyuj0smg)

or create towers of ice with a gesture:

![](figure/ice_towers.png)

### Write a bot to play a game with players over chat:

![](figure/guessnum.png).


### And, of course, make `ggplot` plots in Minecraft:

[![](figure/ggplot.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zggCAYAfjXE)

### Extending

The [craft](https://github.com/kbroman/craft) package includes additional functions that illustrate and extend the use of [miner](https://github.com/kbroman/miner). Contributors who want to extend the functionality of [miner](https://github.com/kbroman/miner) should submit a pull request to the [craft](https://github.com/kbroman/craft) package.

"
895,Kas-tle/java2bedrock.sh,Shell,"## Usage

### Local

To run, simply:
```
./converter.sh MyResourcePack.zip
```

To run without settings prompts, use flags:
- `-w (true|false)` whether or not to show the warning prompt 
- `-m (pack_to_merge.mcpack)` filename of Bedrock Edition resource pack in the same diretory to merge with result of the conversion
- `-a (attachable_material)` material to use for attachables written by the script
- `-b (block_material)` material to use for blocks written by the script
- `-f (https://somesite.com/fallback_pack.zip|null)` URL of a Java Edition resource to use for fallback textures before the default pack
- `-v (default_asset_version)` version of Minecraft Java Edition for which to pull default assets

For example:

```
./converter.sh MyResourcePack.zip -w ""false"" -m ""MyBedrock.mcpack"" -a ""entity_alphatest_one_sided"" -b ""alpha_test"" -f ""null"" -v ""1.18.2""
```

### Item Icons

If you prepare 2D sprites for your 3D models, you can provide the converter with mappings for these sprites to be incorporated into item_texture.json and the exported Geyser mappings. To do so, simply include a file called `sprites.json` in the root of your Java resource pack. The format of this file is as follows:
```json
{
    ""leather"": [
        {
            ""custom_model_data"": 1,
            ""sprite"": ""textures/path/to/texture_in_bedrock_rp/texture1""
        },
        {
            ""custom_model_data"": 2,
            ""sprite"": ""textures/path/to/texture_in_bedrock_rp/texture2""
        }
    ],
    ""diamond_axe"": [
        {
            ""damage_predicate"": 2,
            ""unbreakable"": true,
            ""sprite"": ""textures/path/to/texture_in_bedrock_rp/texture3""
        }
    ]
}
```

When utilizing this feature, you should also use the merge feature to combine the converted pack with an existing Bedrock resource pack containing the specified sprite textures. If using the Github Actions based converter, simply provide a direct download URL of said Bedrock resource pack as done for the Java pack.

### Github Actions

You may also run the converter through Github Actions in this repository by creating an issue with the [Pack Conversion](https://github.com/Kas-tle/java2bedrock.sh/issues/new?assignees=&labels=conversion&template=pack-conversion.yml&title=%5BPack%5D%3A+) template. You are only required to enter the link to the Java pack, though the options described above may also be configured. Your pack will then be queued for conversion by Github Actions. After conversion is complete, the Github Actions bot will reply to your issue with a link to download your converted pack and associated mappings file. Included in the bundle is a behavior pack and addon to view the models in single player, as well as a configuration file containing the paths to the models converted from the Java resource pack and their corresponding identifiers in the Bedrock resource pack.

## About

**NOTICE:** Due to [MCPE-152191](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-152191), any blocks that are larger than 1.9 blocks will not load. This is only relavent to those using the preview pack to display converted models in single player.

The script has been updated to handle parent models and 2D items. It will generate multiple sprite sheets for 3D models without repeating the inclusion of any given texture. 2D item textures will be copied over individually. Note that sprites for 3D items must be added manually.

Your script and resource pack zip file must be in the same directory. Ensure that this zip file is properly setup. It should not have a root directory. Your resource pack must also be formatted correctly, to vanilla specifications. By default, this script will download the default assets in order to generate texture atlases in cases in which you have utilized those. If you wish to use different default assets, you may specify this at the beginning. The default pack will then be downloaded after your specified assets, with your specified assets taking precedence. As long as you provide valid JSON, the script should output something you can use.

You may also specify an input bedrock pack to merge with the output assets produced by the converter. This should be in the same directory as the script and your input Java pack. Like the Java pack, ensure that it is compressed with no root folder. When prompted, type the file name of the input file, such as `example_rp.mcpack`. Merging of behavior packs is not currently supported.

The packs generated by this script can currently only be used in Bedrock Edition 1.16.210.59 and above. Please be sure to enable the experimental setting ""Holiday Creator Features"" on world generation. You'll probably also want to be in creative mode as that will be the only way to give yourself the blocks generated by the script. Here are the commands to obtain one of the items or place them in your head slot:
```
/give @p geysercmd:gmdl_xxxxxxx
/replaceitem entity @p slot.armor.head 0 geysercmd:gmdl_xxxxxxx
``` 
The `xxxxxxx` term corresponds to the short hash assigned to the model. These are written to config.json, which can be found in the target directory, along with packaged and non-packaged versions of the output assets. This will specify the corresponding item and nbt for each input predicate. The short hash is constructed by combining the predicate entry's item, custom model data, damage, and damaged predicates, taking the md5 hash of this string, and keeping only the first 7 characters. As a result, this hash value will remain the same across conversions.

Also note that this script requires:
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) (1.6+)
- [sponge](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/)
- [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) (6+)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [spritesheet-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spritesheet-js)

It will exit if you fail to meet these dependencies. While the ultimate intention here is to import these via Geyser, the script currently generates a behavior pack so that you may view your converted models in Bedrock Edition. It also generates a mappings file compliant with Geyser's custom item mappings system.

Should you have any complaints about getting this to run because you ""only use windows"", do note that I was able to run this perfectly fine on a Mac running Parallels to run Windows to run WSL to run Ubuntu 20. Therefore, I am sure it is perfectly possible for you to get this working, regardless of your OS. I will gladly take such criticism only if you are willing to help develop this into a proper cross platform program. 

## Dependency Installation

### Debian, Ubuntu, & Mint
```sh
sudo apt-get install moreutils jq imagemagick unzip zip nodejs uuid-runtime
npm i -g spritesheet-js
```

### MacOS
```sh
brew install moreutils jq imagemagick unzip zip nodejs uuid-runtime
npm i -g spritesheet-js
```

### RHEL, Fedora, & Centos
```sh
sudo yum install moreutils jq imagemagick unzip zip nodejs uuid-runtime
npm i -g spritesheet-js
```

### Arch Linux
```sh
sudo pacman -S moreutils jq imagemagick unzip zip nodejs uuid-runtime
npm i -g spritesheet-js
```

### Windows
Impossible; consider [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

#### Special Notes for WSL (Ubuntu)

In general, packages on WSL seem to be a little wonky, and sometimes jq-1.5 will be installed, which will not work. To manually install jq-1.6 on WSL, at least for Ubuntu:
```sh
wget https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.6/jq-linux64 && sudo chmod +x jq-linux64 && sudo mv jq-linux64 /usr/bin/jq
```

If you install spritesheet-js globally, but the script fails due to missing the dependency, ensure that the folder containing your global node modules is added to your path. If, after installing, `which spritesheet-js` returns no output, you may add global node modules to your path by:
```sh
echo ""export PATH=$PATH:$(npm config --global get prefix)/bin"" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

https://youtu.be/jbyuWkF0RNQ

## Volumes

**Worlds**
* **Local folder:** /volume1/docker/bedrockserver/worlds
* **Mount path:** /bedrock-server/worlds

## Port Settings

**TCP**
* **Local Port:** 19132 TCP
* **Container Port:** 19132 TCP

**UDP**
* **Local Port:** 19132 UDP
* **Container Port:** 19132 UDP

Open these ports of the local ip of your NAS to the internet in your router. Consult the manual of your router for this.

![Correct local and container ports](https://marc.tv/media/2020/01/bedrock-port.jpg ""Correct local and container ports"")

### Optional: edit server.properties and allowlist.json

To edit the server.properties and allowlist.json you have to add them locally on your NAS
and mount these files in the container.

![Correct local and container paths](https://marc.tv/media/2019/04/bedrock-server-properties.jpg ""Correct local and container paths"")

Download these files and place them in the parent folder of your bedrock docker folder. e.g.

* [Example server.properties file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtoensing/Docker-Minecraft-Bedrock-Server/master/server.properties)
* [Example empty allowlist.json file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtoensing/Docker-Minecraft-Bedrock-Server/master/allowlist.json)

**Worlds**
* **Local folder:** /volume1/docker/bedrockserver/worlds
* **Mount path:** /bedrock-server/worlds

**server.properties**
* **Local file server.properties:** /volume1/docker/bedrockserver/server.properties
* **Mount path:** /bedrock-server/server.properties

**allowlist.json**
* **Local file allowlist.json:** /volume1/docker/bedrockserver/allowlist.json
* **Mount path:** /bedrock-server/allowlist.json

You can edit the server.properties on you NAS directly after you shut down the server. You can edit specific options like gamemode (creative or survival) or enable the allowlist. The later is highly recommended if you plan to open the ports to the internet.

## Add someone to the allowlist and grant user admin rights

You can enter commands in terminal on Synology on your Docker Container. Add users to the allowlist and do not edit the allowlist.json manually:

**allowlist add [xbox playername]**

e.g. `allowlist add MarcTV`

**op [xbox playername]**

e.g. `op MarcTV`

This only works if the user is online.

900,dizzyd/mcdex,Go,"# mcdex - Minecraft Modpack Management

mcdex is a command-line utility that runs on Linux, Windows and OSX 
and makes it easy to manage your modpacks while using the native
Minecraft launcher.

## Downloads

You can find the most recent releases here:

* [Windows](http://files.mcdex.net/releases/win32/mcdex.exe)
* [Linux](http://files.mcdex.net/releases/linux/mcdex)
* [OSX](http://files.mcdex.net/releases/osx/mcdex)

## Getting started

First, make sure you have the most recent database of mods:

```
mcdex db.update
```

## Listing available mod packs on Curseforge

If you want to find all the published modpacks available with 'engineer' in the name, you can do:

```
mcdex pack.list engineer 
```

You'll see output like:

```
advanced-engineering-immersive-rocketry | A RotaryCraft-esque pack for 1.12 | 154 downloads
age-of-engineering | Tech-only modpack with guide and trophies. Focus in progression, divided in 15 ages | 438,304 downloads
ancient-engineering | A light pack focused around Ancient Warfare and Immersive Engineering. | 4,856 downloads
arie-advanced-engineering | Modpack filled with immersive tech mods, combined with the possibility of exploring the galaxy! | 53 downloads
atmospheric-engineering | an overloaded skyfactory style modpack | 0 downloads
coles-engineering | An engineering modpack with big dig vibes | 60 downloads
...
...
```

The first part of each line is the ""slug""; we'll use this in the next step to install the modpack.

## Installing a modpack from Curseforge

Now, let's install the [Age of Engineering](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/age-of-engineering) modpack.

Using the slug we found via pack.list, run:
```
mcdex pack.install aoe age-of-engineering
```

Note that we provide the name ""aoe""; mcdex uses this to install the modpack into your Minecraft home directory
under ```<minecraft>/mcdex/pack/aoe```. Alternatively, you can control what directory the modpack is installed in by passing
an absolute path (e.g. `c:\aoe` or `/Users/dizzyd/aoe`) as the name and mcdex will use that instead.

Once the install is done, you can fire up the Minecraft launcher and you should have a new profile for the aoe pack!

## Creating a new modpack

We can start a new modpack by using the ```pack.create``` command:

```
mcdex pack.create mypack 1.11.2
```

Note that the recommended version of Forge is installed automatically. If you want to force a specific Forge to be used,
you can do
```
mcdex pack.create mypack 1.11.2 13.20.1.2386
```

As before, since we passed a non-absolute filename - 'mypack' - the pack will be created under the Minecraft home directory. 
If we wanted to create the modpack in our home directory (on OSX), we would do:

```
mcdex pack.create /Users/dizzyd/mypack 1.11.2
```

```pack.create``` will create the directory, make sure the appropriate version of Forge is installed and start a manifest.json. 
In addition, it will create an entry in the Minecraft launcher so you can launch the pack.

## Installing individual mods

Once you have a modpack, either installed from CurseForge or one you created locally, you can add individual mods to it. Let's
add [Immersive Engineering](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-engineering) to our new pack:

```
mcdex mod.select mypack immersive-engineering
```

This will search the database of mods for one named 'immersive-engineering' and find the most recent stable version and
add it to the pack's manifest.jason. To actually install the mod, you need to install the pack:

```
mcdex pack.install mypack
```

## Listing available mods

If you want to find all the mods with 'Map' in the name, you can do:

```
mcdex mod.list Map
```

Alternatively, if you want to only look for mods with 'Map' that work on 1.10.2, you can do:

```
mcdex mod.list Map 1.10.2
```

## Updating mods within a pack

If you want to update all the mods within a pack, you can now run:

```
mcdex mod.update.all mypack
```

This will walk over all the installed mods within a manifest and look for more recent versions of the mod that work with your selected version of minecraft.
It will list all the affected mods as it runs, so you can see exactly what changed. If you want to make sure a mod doesn't get updated, in the manifest.json
you can add a ""locked"": true entry to that mod and mcdex will not upgrade it.

Note that you can also run this command with a -n flag (dry run) so that it will simply print out the mods that were 
updated without actually updating the manifest.

Once you've updated the manifest with mod.update.all, you need to re-install the pack to make sure the new mods are updated:

```
mcdex pack.install mypack
```

902,MineWeb/MineWebCMS,JavaScript,"# MineWebCMS


## C'est quoi MineWeb ?

Le CMS est en bêta depuis 15 août 2015 et en version finale depuis le 3 mai 2016.

MineWeb est un CMS (c'est-à-dire un système de gestion de contenu), en plus simple, un site complètement personnalisable et intuitif, qui s'adaptera parfaitement à vos serveurs Minecraft !

Vous pourrez tenir vos joueurs au courant des actualités, leur faire acheter des articles sur la boutique... Vous pourrez personnaliser le CMS avec toutes sortes de thèmes ou plugins ! 

### Le CMS est gratuit et opensource ?

Jusqu'en mars 2018, il vous fallait avoir une licence payante pour utiliser le CMS. Mais désormais celui-ci est entièrement disponible sur Github et gratuitement. Il vous suffit de télécharger le repo pour utiliser le CMS sans aucun problème, celui-ci n'est plus dépendant de notre API. 

#### Pourquoi l'avoir rendu gratuit et opensource ?

Premièrement je maintenais ce projet depuis plusieurs années presque complètement seul (hormis les 2/3 supports et 2 amis pour m'aider sur l'infrastructure) et je commençais à m'en lasser, de plus, ne jouant plus à Minecraft je ne m'intéressais plus à ce domaine. Dès mars 2018 j'ai eu ma réelle première expérience professionnelle me poussant également a arrêter ce projet. 

Deuxièmement, le CMS est en développement depuis plusieurs années sur un vieux framework, le code est vieux et j'ai évolué depuis le début, une refonte sera nécessaire pour rajouter des fonctionnalités intéressantes et maintenir correctement le projet mais le manque de temps et de motivation ne m'ont pas permis de le faire.

Troisièmement je ne tenais pas a faire disparaitre le CMS et empêcher mes anciens utilisateurs de l'utiliser. De plus, cela ajoute du contenu sur mon Github. 

### Statistiques

MineWeb, avant ce passage à l'OpenSource c'est plus de 5 000 utilisateurs, plus de 1 500 licences, plus de 100 licences hébergées tous les mois, un Discord avec plus de 800 membres, plusieurs milliers de tickets sur le support.

## Comment l'utiliser ?

### Installation

Pour installer le CMS, rien de plus simple, il vous suffit de télécharger les fichiers sur ce repo, et de les placer sur votre serveur web, pour les pré-requis et autres informations, vous avez la documentation disponible [ici](https://docs.mineweb.org) ou [ici](https://github.com/MineWeb/docs.mineweb.org)

### Support

Le site officiel étant partiellement coupé, plus aucun support officiel n'est assuré, mais vous pouvez toujours faire part de vos problèmes sur le [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/3QYdt8r) ou avec les [Issues](https://github.com/MineWeb/MineWebCMS/issues) sur Github. 

### Plugins et thèmes

Le site officiel étant partiellement coupé, le market n'est plus disponible et maintenu sur celui-ci. Le CMS se base donc maintenant sur les repos faisant partie de l'[organisation MineWeb](https://github.com/MineWeb). Tous les plugins affichés sur le CMS sont les repos commençant par _Plugin-_ (et pour les thèmes _Theme-_). 
Si vous souhaitez voir les sources d'un plugin ou alors y contribuer, il vous suffit de vous rendre sur le repo correspondant (ex: [Boutique](https://github.com/MineWeb/Plugin-Shop)). 

Si vous souhaitez ajouter un plugin ou un thème sur le CMS, il vous suffit simplement de nous le demander sur notre Discord pour être ajouté dans l'organisation, ce qui vous permettra de créer un plugin ou un thème. 
Pour cela, il vous suffira de créer votre propre repo (sur l'organisation) avec le préfix adéquate (_Plugin-_ ou _Theme-_), et d'y développer votre plugin/thème en suivant la [documentation](https://docs.mineweb.org). 
Il vaut mieux créer plusieurs branches (_dev_ pour le développement par exemple) car le CMS utilise la branche _master_ pour récupérer le contenu du plugin ou du thème. 

## Contribuer

Si vous souhaitez contribuer au CMS vous êtes libres de soumettre des pull-requests que je me ferait une joie de regarder et merge.
De plus vous pouvez également encore développer des thèmes ou des plugins pour la communauté.

905,rokups/hello-vue-django,Python,"# hello-vue + Django

This is a boilerplate project for using vuejs with Django.

### Features

* Django backend in `./backend`
* vuejs (v2) frontend in `./frontend`
* Hot-reload with vue-loader
* eslint linter integration
* Makefile to make your life easy


### Development environment setup

These steps will install all required dependencies including development ones, run migrations and start dev server.

```bash
make dev
make migrate
make run
```

### Deployment

These steps will install production dependencies and build vuejs application to `static/dist` folder.

```bash
make prod
make build
```

### Be aware

For the sake of simplicity Django config is contained within its own backend app. In real world setting you would
probably want to remove `backend` from `INSTALLED_APPS`, create a new app and move `backend.views` to it.

You probably want to create python virtual environment as well. Default python instance available will be used.

907,tintin10q/minecraft-logs-analyzer,Python,"# Minecraft-Logs-Analyzer
A tool to analyze game logs generated by Minecraft to calculate your total playtime. This is done to calculate the total playtime based on the logs. You can create graphs from the playtime and also export it as a csv file. [Download it here](https://github.com/tintin10q/minecraft-logs-analyzer/releases/latest)

~Due to the text encoding used, this will likely only work on Windows.~ I have tested it on ubuntu 20 and it worked through wine. 

### There are 3 modes:

1. Automatic (default)
2. Enter path(s)
3. Enter glob

1: Automatic trys to detect your logs in the normal minecraft folder 
`C:/Users/USER/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/logs`

2: With this mode you can enter your own file paths
Separate multiple paths with pipes (vertical bar: | ).

3: With glob you can enter a glob to select multiple folders in a directory,
glob will basically select your path but also all the paths of any subdirectories that might exist in your specified path and that match the glob
Separate multiple globs with pipes (vertical bar: | ). Make sure files don't overlap

Folders that start with period must be explicitly specified
(AppData/Roaming/.*/logs)

> **Glob-Example:** To find all logs folders in all folders that start with . in AppData,
`C:/Users/USER/AppData/Roaming/.*/**`
This would select all the logs in .minecraft but also in .technic for example.

Globs can take a bit to load if your selection is large.

You can read more about globs [here](https://pymotw.com/3/glob/).


This is how it all looks:

![Program GUI](https://i.imgur.com/UDoV2pC.png)

![A minecraft playtime graph](https://i.imgur.com/Og3PXvG.png)

---

## Results
You can export the results into 2 ways
- A graph with hours per month
- A csv file with hours per session

## False positives
If you use the .exe file you might get a false positive with virus programs. I used pyinstaller to create a .exe from the .pyw file. I used this command to build the .exe: 

```
pyinstaller --clean --icon=icon.ico --onefile --splash=splash.png minecraft_logs_analyzer.pyw
```

There is also a [Makefile](./Makefile) included so you can just use that to build your own .exe if you don't trust mine but you have to install [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) with `pip install --user pyinstaller`.

This next part is only for those who use the .pyw version

---

At least python 3.6 is required for this program to work it might work on python 3.5, but I have not tested that.

(I now added python 3.7 and 3.8 support)

This program uses matplotlib pyplot to create graphs. If you do not have matplotlib installed please install it by entering the flowing command into the cmd:
`pip install --user matplotlib`

If that does not work try to reinstall python and make sure to click the install pip option.

The program will also detect if you do not have matplotlib installed, and it will ask you if you want to auto install.
This will basically run `os.system(""pip install --user matplotlib"")` this is the same as running `pip install --user matplotlib` in the cmd.

Prismarine-NBT is a JavaScript parser and serializer for [NBT](http://wiki.vg/NBT) archives. It supports big, little, and little-varint encoded NBT files.


## Usage

#### as a async promise

```js
const fs = require('fs/promises')
const nbt = require('prismarine-nbt')

async function main(file) {
  const buffer = await fs.readFile(file)
  const { parsed, type } = await nbt.parse(buffer)
  console.log('JSON serialized', JSON.stringify(result, null, 2))
  fs.createWriteStream('file.nbt').write(nbt.writeUncompressed(result, type)) // Write it back 
}

main('file.nbt')
```

#### as a callback

```js
var fs = require('fs'),
    nbt = require('prismarine-nbt');

fs.readFile('bigtest.nbt', function(error, data) {
    if (error) throw error;

    nbt.parse(data, function(error, data) {
        console.log(data.value.stringTest.value);
        console.log(data.value['nested compound test'].value);
    });
});
```

If the data is gzipped, it is automatically decompressed, for the buffer see metadata.buffer

## API

### parse(data, [format]): Promise<{ parsed, type, metadata: { size, buffer? } }>
### parse(data, [format,] callback)

Takes an optionally compressed `data` buffer and reads the nbt data.

If the endian `format` is known, it can be specified as 'big', 'little' or 'littleVarint'. If not specified, the library will
try to sequentially load as big, little and little varint until the parse is successful. The deduced type is returned as `type`.

Minecraft Java Edition uses big-endian format, and Bedrock uses little-endian.

### writeUncompressed(value, format='big')

Returns a buffer with a serialized nbt `value`. 

### parseUncompressed(data, format='big')

Takes a buffer `data` and returns a parsed nbt value.


### simplify(nbt)

Returns a simplified nbt representation : keep only the value to remove one level.
This loses the types so you cannot use the resulting representation to write it back to nbt.

### protos : { big, little, littleVarint }

Provides compiled protodef instances used to parse and serialize nbt

### proto

Provide the big-endian protodef instance used to parse and serialize nbt.

### protoLE

Provide the little-endian protodef instance used to parse and serialize little endian nbt.

### builder

Provides a way to build complex nbt structures simply:

```js
const nbt = require('prismarine-nbt')
const tag = nbt.comp({
  Air: nbt.short(300),
  Armor: nbt.list(nbt.comp([
    { Count: nbt.byte(0), Damage: nbt.short(0), Name: nbt.string('a') },
    { Count: nbt.byte(0), Damage: nbt.short(0), Name: nbt.string('b') },
    { Count: nbt.byte(0), Damage: nbt.short(0), Name: nbt.string('c') }
  ]))
})
nbt.writeUncompressed(tag) // now do something with this nbt buffer...
```

See [index.d.ts](typings/index.d.ts#L69) for methods

## Browser usage

For webpack usage, see an example configuration [here](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-web-client/blob/master/webpack.common.js#L28).

For a web bundle with browserify (after you ran `npm install prismarine-nbt` in your project):
```
npx browserify -r prismarine-nbt -r buffer -o pnbt.js
```
```html
<script src=""./pnbt.js""></script>
<script>
  const nbt = require('prismarine-nbt')
  const { Buffer } = require('buffer')
  fetch('test.nbt').then(resp => resp.arrayBuffer())
    .then(buf => nbt.parse(Buffer.from(buf))).then(console.log)
</script>
```

# MC-Remapper

Deobfuscator for Minecraft

Mojang provide mapping file of obfuscated class, field, and method name for minecraft mod developer.
This program applies mapping file to original minecraft code. It does not decompile jar,
but only apply mapping. You have to decompile jar with your favorite decompiler after deobfuscate minecraft with mc-remapper.

# Compile
Java 17 is required to compile MC-Remapper.\
Clone project to your local machine and open terminal in the directory where build.gradle located.
Run following command to compile.

```
./gradlew installDist
```

Runnable script and runtime libraries will generate under `build/install/MC-Remapper`.

# Usage

Open terminal at `build/install/MC-Remapper/bin`. 
Execute MC-Remapper (Mac/Linux) or MC-Remapper.bat(Windows) with following parameters.

## Arguments
### Execute with specific file
To run mc remapper with a specific file, you can provide input jar and mapping txt. 

Input jar is path to file or url of obfuscated minecraft client or server.

Mapping txt is path to file or url of proguard's mapping txt file.  You can find it at `.minecraft/versions/$version$/$version$.json` file.

### Execute with version

To run mc remapper with automatically download artifact and mapping tt, you can provide artifact name and version id.

Artifact name is either server or client.

Version id is release version or snapshot version.


## Options

### --output or --output-name(Default=Generate from other arguments)

Path to output file. If file already exists, overwrite it.

### --thread (Default=8)
Number of thread used for apply mapping to class.

### --fixlocalvar (Default=no)
Fix local variable name \u2603(☃). 
This variable name declared multiple time in same scope, 
so some decompiler does not work. There are three options.

|option|description|
|---|---|
|no|Do not fix|
|rename|Rename problematic local variable to debug$index like debug1, debug2...|
|delete|Delete problematic local variable|


### --reobf (Flag, Default=no)

__This option is useless for now. Both forge and bukkit modify nms with their own mapping, therefore applying this option is meaningless__

Reobf option reverses mapping direction. By default, MC-Remapper map obfuscated code to deobfuscated code. However, if you write your mod/plugin with deobfuscated minecraft source and apply it to forge/bukkit, minecraft will crash with NoClassDefFoundException, NoSuchMethodException, or else. That's because, forge or bukkit use obfuscated code, but your plugin tried to access to deobfuscated code. In this case, you have to re-obfuscate your mod/plugin to use obfuscated minecraft code. You can
use this option to map deobfuscated to. obfuscated code.

For csrg/srg mappings, this option is needed to apply deobfuscating mapping. i.e. deobfuscating = --reobf, reobfuscating = no --reobf.


### --format (Default=proguard)

Supported mapping format: proguard, csrg, srg

### --autologger (Flag, default=no)

Static final fields with type org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger is automatically renamed to `LOGGER` if it is not explicitly renamed by the mapping.

### --autotoken (Flag, default=no)

Members' names that are Java keywords are automatically appended an underscore (_).

### --mappackage (Map, default=None)

Renames packages AFTER other mappings are applied. Can occur multiple times, where they are merged.

Example: --mappackage =net.minecraft.server.v1_15 --mappackage net.minecraft.server=net.minecraft.server.v1_15

The unnamed package is renamed to net.minecraft.server.v1_15, and net.minecraft.server is renamed to net.minecraft.server.v1_15.

# Example usages

## Execute by specifying input file and mapping url

```
./MC-Remapper server.jar https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/448ccb7b455f156bb5cb9cdadd7f96cd68134dbd/server.txt
```

## Execute by specifying input and mapping file with options

```
./MC-Remapper server.jar server_mapping.txt --output deobf.jar --thread 8 --fixlocalvar=delete --reobf
```

## Execute by specifying version

```
./MC-Remapper server 1.15.2
```

The Minecraft Mod Package Manager!

Modget is based on TheBrokenRail's [ModUpdater](https://gitea.thebrokenrail.com/TheBrokenRail/ModUpdater) mod and is inspired heavily by Microsoft's [Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).


## Commands
Currently, Modget supports the following commands:
```
/modget list                     Lists all installed mods recognized by modget
/modget repos list               Lists all installed manifest repositories
/modget repos add <repo url>     Adds a custom repository
/modget repos enable <repo id>   Enables the selected repository
/modget repos disable <repo id>  Disables the selected repository
/modget repos remove <repo id>   Removes the selected repository
/modget search <mod>             Searches all repositories for a matching mod
/modget upgrade                  Lists all available mod updates
/modget refresh                  Refreshes the local manifest cache
```

These additional commands will be added over the next few releases:
```
/modget install <mod>            Downloads the according mod
/modget uninstall <mod>          Deletes the according mod
/modget upgrade <mod>            Updates the according mod
/modget upgrade --all            Updates all mods
```

If you're on a server, use `/modgetserver` instead of `/modget`.

In contrast to the original ModUpdater, Modget doesn't require specific opt-ins. It detects mods based on their modid and gets the update files using its manifest repository.


## GUI
We also have a WIP GUI. To access it, please install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)!
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48808497/146324594-9be0d900-9597-4e97-b237-85bfe8595795.png)



## Mod Developers
If you want to add first-party support for your mods, please regularly submit new versions over at the [manifest repository](https://github.com/ReviversMC/modget-manifests).

If you want to disable Modget's automatic update checks for your mod (in case you have implemented a custom solution), add the following to your `fabric.mod.json`:
```json
{
    ""custom"": {
        ""modget"": {
            ""noAutoCheck"": ""true""
        }
    }
}
```
Note that manual checks started by the user will still show updates for your mod.

Other values you can add are:
- `preferredPlatform`: Can take the values `curseforge`, `modrinth` or `sourceControl` and determines which platform Modget should prioritize when attempting to download your mod.


## Community
[![Discord chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat%20on-discord-7289DA?logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/6bTGYFppfz)

# Sandstone

Sandstone is a Typescript library for Minecraft Datapacks. It allows easy creation, debug and sharing of Minecraft functions, loot tables, predicates etc...

Interested? Join our Discord:

[![Discord](https://invidget.switchblade.xyz/4tzM5aXDRe)](https://discord.gg/4tzM5aXDRe)

## Features

## 💻 Perfect autocompletion & IDE support

Sandstone tells you what a command expects, and autocompletes complicated arguments for you.

You don't need to remember commands syntax anymore.

![autocomplete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheMrZZ/sandstone/4d3d74210b74ccf0bb807b90c35c1920ce1aa44a/docs/readme/autocomplete.gif)

This autocompletion works for all resources: commands, predicates, loot tables, advancements...

## 📂 Better organisation of resources
You can have multiple functions, advancements, loot tables per files - or you can keep the vanilla organisation, and have only 1 per file. Sandstone allows you to organise your data pack as you prefer, without sticking to Mojang's conventions.

You also benefit from all the capabilities of a real programming language: multiline comments, indentation, documentation...

## 🚀 Useful and heavily optimized abstractions

Sandstone includes common and heavily optimized abstractions:
- Control statements, with `if`, `else if` and `else`
- Boolean logic, with `or`, `and` and `not`
- Loops, with `while` and `for`
- Sleep statement, which waits a certain time before running the next commands

These statements are most of the time more optimized than hand-written code, since they switch between different implementations to get the fastest one. They have been studied and designed for performance.

However, you stay free: you can keep using only vanilla commands, if you prefer - Sandstone does not get in your way.

## 👐 Easy to share
Sharing commands has **never been easier**. Just publish your functions on NPM, and everyone can use them to improve their own datapacks. Whether it's some common code like raycasting, or some new abstractions like better `/tellraw`, the Sandstone ecosystem grows by the day.

You can finally stop reinventing the wheel.

A class to hold chunk data for Minecraft: PC 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15 and 1.16 and Bedrock Edition 0.14 and 1.0, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18 and 1.19

## Usage

```js
const registry = require('prismarine-registry')('1.8')
const ChunkColumn = require('prismarine-chunk')(registry)
const { Vec3 } = require(""vec3"")

const chunk = new ChunkColumn()

for (let x = 0; x < 16;x++) {
  for (let z = 0; z < 16; z++) {
    chunk.setBlockType(new Vec3(x, 50, z), 2)
    for (let y = 0; y < 256; y++) {
      chunk.setSkyLight(new Vec3(x, y, z), 15)
    }
  }
}

console.log(JSON.stringify(chunk.getBlock(new Vec3(3,50,3)),null,2))
```

## Test data

### pc

Test data can be generated with [minecraftChunkDumper](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-chunk-dumper).

Install it globally with `npm install minecraft-chunk-dumper -g` then run :

`minecraftChunkDumper saveChunks 1.19 ""1_19"" 10`

### bedrock

Run tests in [bedrock-provider](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/bedrock-provider/) (which loads chunks through a client as part of its tests) and copy the generated data from `fixtures/$version/pchunk` into `tests/bedrock_$version`.

For the version, copy one chunk column of `level_chunk` without caching, `level_chunk` with caching, `level_chunk CacheMissResponse`, `subchunk` without caching, `subchunk cached` and `subchunk CacheMissResponse` into the test/version folder.

Note: bedrock-provider tests network decoding and loading chunks from a save database. The tests in prismarine-chunk test other parts of the chunk API, such as
setting and getting block light, type, biome, entity and block entity data.

# API

## Chunk

#### Chunk(initData: { minY?: number, worldHeight?: number })

Build a new chunk. initData is only for 1.18+, and if not given or null the world will default to an old-style 0-256 world.

#### Chunk.initialize(iniFunc)

Initialize a chunk.
* `iniFunc` is a function(x,y,z) returning a prismarine-block.

That function is faster than iterating and calling the setBlock* manually. It is useful to generate a whole chunk and load a whole chunk.

#### Chunk.version

returns the version the chunk loader was called with

#### Chunk.section

![Release](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/eu.cloudnetservice.cloudnet/driver?label=release&logo=gradle)

## Adding CloudNet to your build

CloudNet is using the `eu.cloudnetservice.cloudnet` group id and is available through maven central. The most important
submodules are:

| artifact id | usage                                                                                                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| driver      | When developing plugins or modules, available on all platforms.                                              |
| node        | When developing a module which needs more specific access to node functions than the driver can offer.       |
| wrapper-jvm | When developing plugins which need some more specific access to the service api than the driver can offer.   |
| bridge      | When trying to catch player events and/or interacting with players regardless where they are on the network. |
| bom         | When you want to import all dependencies with the same version based on the imported bill of materials.      |

To add the CloudNet dependency using gradle (replace `%version%` with the latest version shown in the badge above):

```groovy
repositories {
  // ensure maven central is added
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  // optional - you can also specify versions directly
  implementation platform('eu.cloudnetservice.cloudnet:bom:%version%')
  compileOnly 'eu.cloudnetservice.cloudnet:driver'

  // without bom
  compileOnly 'eu.cloudnetservice.cloudnet:driver:%version%'
}
```

To add the CloudNet dependency using maven (replace `%version%` with the latest version shown in the badge above):

```xml
<!-- optional - you can also specify versions directly -->
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>eu.cloudnetservice.cloudnet</groupId>
      <artifactId>bom</artifactId>
      <version>%version%</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>eu.cloudnetservice.cloudnet</groupId>
    <artifactId>driver</artifactId>
    <version>%version%</version> <!-- only needed when bom is not used -->
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Snapshots

Snapshots for CloudNet are build off the `nightly` branch and are available from the sonatype snapshot repository:
`https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/`. You can declare a dependency on CloudNet as shown above
just append the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix to the version.

## Compile from source

To compile CloudNet you need JDK 17 and an internet connection. Then clone this repository and run `./gradlew` inside
the cloned project.

## Warnings

1. Api methods which are marked with `@ApiStatus.Internal` can change or get removed without a warning, even between
   patch releases. We recommend to not use these methods and try to find an alternative for them.
2. Api methods which are marked with `@ApiStatus.Experimental` can change or get removed without a warning, even between
   patch releases. While the api method is still in an experimental state, that does not mean that the implementation is
   considered experimental.
3. Api methods which are marked with `@Deprecated` should get replaced as soon as possible (the javadoc of the method
   will contain and explanation why the method is deprecated and how to replace the usage). This annotation is in most
   cases paired with `@ApiStatus.ScheduledForRemoval` indicating the minor version when the method gets removed.
4. Serialized forms of all classes are subject to change. Do not persist classes and assume that a future version will
   still be compatible with the stored version.
5. Dependencies which are not exposed directly might be upgraded to the next major release without a warning. Be aware
   of that when including dependencies and relying on CloudNet shipping them bundled.

Raspberry Jam Mod - a Mod Forge Minecraft 1.8+ mod implementing most of Raspberry Juice/Pi API

To install for single-player and LAN use (as well as for client-side use with a server):
 1. Set up a Minecraft profile of the correct Minecraft version and run it once.
 2. Install the lastest version of Minecraft Forge for your precise Minecraft version (http://files.minecraftforge.net/)
 3. Put the contents of mods.zip in your .minecraft/mods folder (there will be a number of 
    subfolders like 1.8, 1.8.9, etc.--they should all go there).
 4. Put the sample scripts in in your .minecraft/mcpipy directory.
 5. Install Python if you need to.
On Windows, steps 3-5 can be automated by using the .exe installer.

To install on a server:
 1. Download a Forge installer from http://files.minecraftforge.net/
 2. Run and it point it to a directory where you want your server to be, select ""Server"", 
    and it will download and install a Minecraft server.
 3. Create a mods/ folder in the server directory and put RaspberryJamMod.jar for your
    server version there.
 4. Put some sample scripts in a mcpipy/ subdirectory of the same folder as your minecraft server.
    Make sure to include all mcpipy/mcpi. 
 5. If your server is open outside your LAN make a passwords.dat file and place it in your server directory, and make sure
    each of your users has a .minecraft/mcpipy/mcpi/security.py file that matches it. See SECURITY.md for more information.
 6. Instead of running minecraft_server_X.Y.jar to start the server, run the forge jar.

On a server, /py launches a script in the server's mcpipy/ directory, while /lpy launches a script in the client's 
.minecraft/mcpipy/ directory. Note that /lpy only works if the client has the mod installed (otherwise, the user has
to submit script for curation and inclusion on the server, or launch them manually outside of Minecraft, making sure
their script contains the server IP; this is automagically handled if the script is launched via /lpy."

929,octarine-noise/simpledeobf,Kotlin,"### What is this?

**simpledeobf** is a very simple and primitive command-line deobfuscator for
Minecraft mods. You can use it to create dev versions of mod releases
for debugging. Or anything else, really - it all depends on what inputs and
mapping files you use. Feel free to get creative with it.

### How to use it?

simpledeobf will need files from your Gradle cache which are created by
ForgeGradle, so it's best to start with a ForgeGradle workspace already
set up for your target Minecraft version.

Command-line options:

* `--output` The path to the resulting jar. You can only have one.
* `--input` The input jar you wish to deobfuscate. Can be repeated, but the
files from all inputs will just end up in a single output jar.
* `--mapFile` The path to the MCP mapping file, found in your Gradle cache
somewhere under `minecraft/de/oceanlabs/mcp`. You need to use the one that
corresponds to the namespaces you are converting from and to, and also
matches the ones you use in your project. Can be repeated, later files will
overwrite mappings from previous ones.
* `--map` Defines a single explicit mapping. This option is treated as if
it was a line in the MCP mapping file. Takes precedence over mappings
read from MCP files. Can be repeated.
* `--ref` The path to a reference jar. Can be repeated. The classes inside
are read only to determine the class hierarchy, which may be needed to properly
deobfuscate certain jar files. The reference jar must be in the same namespace
as the input.

   More precisely: you will need to provide a proper class hierarchy
to deobfuscate overridden methods whose declaring classes or interfaces are
2 or more levels above the overriding class.

   When in doubt, try using a Minecraft jar of the proper namespace.
* `--defaultPkg` move all classes from the default package into this one. Having
classes in the default package can mess with source attachment in the IDE.
* `--forcePublic` make all fields, methods and inner classes public. The
poor man's access transformer.
* `--xdeltaPrefix` Prefix for xdelta files.
* `--xdeltaPostfix` Postfix for xdelta files. Must be used together with the
previous option.

   Files that match the given pre/postfixes will be interpreted as patches.
   The same filename with pre/postfixes stripped from it will be searched for
   in the reference jars. If found, the patch will be applied to this file
   and the result used as if the patched version had been read from the
   input jar.
* `--help` or `-?` displays a quick overview of these options.

Have your favourite brand of decompiler ready, and be prepared to dig through
the result, and make several iterations before you end up with something
usable.

Also there's no guarantee that it's even possible to create a workable dev jar
for any given mod. If it uses reflection and/or class transformation, chances
are good that it will just crash anyway, unless it's specifically made to be
environment agnostic.

### Have OptiFine, will debug

As an example, here is a guide on getting OptiFine into your dev
environment with simpledeobf. This is *the* prime use-case of simpledeobf,
and the reason for its existence.

The following is the actual command I use for the deobfuscation itself,
so you'll need to change the directory names. It's a single command, but I
broke it up into lines for readability.
```
java -jar simpledeobf-0.5.jar
--input h:\Minecraft\mods\obf\OptiFine_1.8.8_HD_U_H2.jar
--output h:\Minecraft\mods\mcp\OptiFine_1.8.8_HD_U_H2-dev.jar
--mapFile h:\Minecraft\.gradle\caches\minecraft\de\oceanlabs\mcp\mcp_stable\20\srgs\notch-mcp.srg
--ref h:\Minecraft\.gradle\caches\minecraft\net\minecraft\minecraft_merged\1.8.8\minecraft_merged-1.8.8.jar
--map=""CL: bet$1 net/minecraft/client/entity/AbstractClientPlayer$1""
--map=""CL: b$8 net/minecraft/crash/CrashReport$8""
--forcePublic
```
This will give you a jar with the `stable_20` mappings. The 2 `map` options are
needed because OptiFine declares some extra inner classes that are not present
in vanilla and have no mappings. If you want to do this for a different Minecraft
version, you'll have to change these. Just start without manual mappings, and
check if there are still obfuscated classes in the result. Check in the MCP
files what the outer class is, and add a mapping. Rinse and repeat.

Open the resulting jar file, and delete the `net/minecraftforge` directory.
There are dummy classes inside that are normally not loaded, but will cause
problems in a dev environment. They need to go.

Now you have to create a tweaker and class transformer, because the default
OptiFine ones will not work properly in a dev environment.
[Here is mine](https://github.com/octarine-noise/BetterFoliage/blob/c0be72bb37311508c68db5bd3b09d2f99a76614c/src/main/kotlin/optifine/OptifineTweakerDevWrapper.kt)
that I use in Better Foliage, you need something similar. The point is to
change dots to slashes in the class names, so the OptiFine transformer can find
the deobfuscated class files.

Edit the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file. Change the `TweakClass` option to the
tweaker you just made.

The jar is now ready. If you also want source attachment, which is highly
recommended, just decompile it with your favourite tool (I prefer JD-GUI), and
save a source jar. Make sure that *""Realign line numbers""* or the equivalent
option is turned on.

Drop the jar in the mods folder of your workspace, manually add it to the project
dependencies after all the Gradle stuff, set its source attachment, and you're
ready. You can start your project with OptiFine thrown in the mix, debug,
set breakpoints, and everything.

**Note:** Debugging *into* one of the vanilla classes that OptiFine overwrites
may or may not give you some headache under Eclipse. I can only confirm it works
fine under IDEA, which allows you to switch between sources on the fly if multiple
jar files declare a class. A popup comes up saying *""Alternative source available
for the class blah blah blah""*, and you can switch to the OptiFine jar, which
contains the class actually executing.

### OptiFine H5 and beyond

Starting with release H5, OptiFine has adopted a patch-based approach. Instead of
replacing the impacted class files with alternative ones, it supplies patches in
the *xdelta* format that are applied at runtime.

Instead of transforming xdelta files, simpledeobf is able to create classic
replacement-style deobfuscated jar files by applying the patches against the
original Minecraft jar. Again, you'll need to create a class transformer that is
able to load it [like this](https://github.com/octarine-noise/BetterFoliage/blob/abf037d8a9640594a76b9f2524885da6f440bd41/src/main/kotlin/optifine/OptifineTweakerDevWrapper.kt).

Here is the example command line I use to deobfuscate OptiFine for 1.9.
```
java -jar simpledeobf-0.6.jar
--input h:\Minecraft\mods\obf\OptiFine_1.9.0_HD_U_B2_pre.jar
--output h:\Minecraft\mods\mcp\OptiFine_1.9.0_HD_U_B2_pre-dev.jar
--mapFile h:\Minecraft\.gradle\caches\minecraft\de\oceanlabs\mcp\mcp_snapshot\20160406\srgs\notch-mcp.srg
--ref h:\Minecraft\.gradle\caches\minecraft\net\minecraft\minecraft\1.9\minecraft-1.9.jar
--forcePublic
--xdeltaPrefix=""patch/""
--xdeltaPostfix="".xdelta""
```

Note the use of the regular `minecraft` binary, instead of `minecraft_merged`.

## Quick start guide

_Prerequisites:_ Chunky requires **Java 17**. It is recommended to have the **64-bit** version if you have a 64-bit operating system (you most likely do). If you haven't installed Java, you can [download it from here, selecting Temurin 17 LTS][jdk]. You also need (Open) **JavaFX 17** LTS, which you can [download from here][jfx] and extract it; We cover valid extraction locations and manually adding the JavaFX module under the [Troubleshooting article][chunky-dev-troubleshooting].

1. Download [the Chunky Launcher][chunkylauncherjar] and open it
2. Install the latest version of Chunky by clicking on _Check for Updates_
3. Click on _Launch Chunky_ start rendering your beautiful buildings

For guides and more information please checkout the [Documentation][chunky-dev]. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out via [Reddit][chunky-reddit], [Discord][chunky-discord], or GitHub.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is there noise/grain/random bright dots in the render?</strong></summary>

> This is not a bug, but an unfortunate effect of [the rendering algorithm][chunky-dev-rendering] used in Chunky. Torches and other small light sources cause a very random illumination and it takes a long time to render such light nicely.
>
> You can disable emitters under the Lighting tab in the Render Controls dialog to remove most of the random bright dots. Note that rendering for a longer time will eventually remove the noise, though it may take a very long time.
>
> Another way of removing the noise is using the [Denoiser Plugin][chunky-denoiser]. While this can yield good results in most cases, it may distort the image in some cases.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How long does it take to render an image?</strong></summary>

> This depends on your CPU, the size of the image and the lighting conditions of the scene you are rendering. You can use the tips from the previous answer to get away with shorter render times.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why do I see blue question marks or red crosses instead of blocks?</strong></summary>

> Chunky renders blue question marks for unsupported blocks. Maybe your Chunky version is outdated or the block is not yet supported. If the latter is the case, please file a bug report.
>
> Red crosses are caused by missing textures. Please ensure that you're using a texturepack for the Minecraft version for the world you are rendering.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Which Minecraft versions are supported?</strong></summary>

> Chunky 2.4.4 supports Minecraft 1.2-1.19.2 worlds and Cubic Chunks for Minecraft 1.10-1.12 worlds.
>
> We typically add new blocks shortly after a new Minecraft snapshot is released. Use the latest Chunky snapshot to render them until a new Chunky version is released.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is GPU rendering supported?</strong></summary>

> There is a work-in-progress [OpenCL plugin for Chunky][chunky-opencl]. If you'd like to help with this, PRs are welcome!

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why are mobs not rendered?</strong></summary>

> Chunky currently can't render all entities. Future support for rendering more entities is planned, so stay tuned!

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can Chunky render mod blocks?</strong></summary>

> No. Due to the vast number of mods, this is not feasible at the moment. However support for JSON-defined block models is being worked on.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where can I find good skymaps?</strong></summary>

> The [skymaps page][chunky-dev-skymaps] has some good links. Another good place is the #skymaps channel on our [Discord server][chunky-discord].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Chunky keeps freezing or crashing</strong></summary>

> Chunky uses a lot of memory. If Chunky has too little memory to work with it may slow down to a crawl or crash. The memory limit can be increased in the Chunky Launcher.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Rendering using the command line (Headless Mode)</strong></summary>

> It is possible to render a scene from the command line. First set up a scene
> using the GUI. Don't forget to save the scene. Then run the following on the
> command line:
>
>     java -jar chunky.jar -render SceneName
>
> Where SceneName is the name of the scene to render. You can read more about [headless rendering here.][chunky-dev-headless]

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Shutdown when render completes on Unix-like Systems (Mac OS X, Linux, BSD)</strong></summary>

> In the Advanced tab of the Render Controls window, you can check the checkbox
> that says ""Shutdown when render completes"" to shut down your computer when the
> set SPP target is reached. (This can be toggled while rendering.)
>
> On Unix-like systems, the `shutdown` terminal command has to be run as root
> using `sudo`. For various reasons, Chunky cannot prompt for the password to
> `sudo`, so you must configure your system to allow the command to run without a
> password.
>
> Open a terminal (such as bash) and run `sudo visudo`, providing your password.
>
> Add the following line at the end of the file: (press Insert to type)
>
>     %user_name ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
>
> Replace `user_name` with your username.
>
> Press Escape, then type `:wq`.
>
> You may need to restart or log out and in for this to take effect.
>
> This will only allow `sudo shutdown` to run without a password; no other
> commands run with `sudo` will be affected.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about the Chunky SpigotMC plugin?</strong></summary>

> The [Chunky SpigotMC plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/) is an unfortunate name collision and is unrelated to this project. Chunky (SpigotMC plugin) is a handy plugin to quickly pre-generate server chunks should you need that functionality. You can also find [Chunky (SpigotMC Plugin) on GitHub](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky).

</details>

More information about Chunky, including a short getting started guide and
rendering tips are available at the [Chunky Documentation page][chunky-dev]. For more insights into Chunky's development, keep an eye on the [Discord][chunky-discord]; messages from contributors can sometimes give you insight into what everyone is working on.

## Hacking on Chunky

It is recommended to use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
Install the Java17 JDK ([Temurin](https://adoptium.net/) is the recomended distribution).
Then, [clone](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/set-up-a-git-repository.html#clone-repo) the Chunky
repository and let IntelliJ index the project. Navigate to `chunky/src/java/se/llbit/chunky/main/Chunky.java` and
click on the green play button next to `public class Chunky {` to build and run Chunky.

To build Chunky externally, run the `gradlew` script in the project root directory. Gradle is setup with a few
main tasks:

- `build` - Build Chunky, documentation, and run tests.
- `release` - Build and save files ready for a release to a Chunky update site. Outputs to `build/release`
- `buildReleaseJar` - Build an installer JAR. Outputs to `build/installer`
- `docs` - Build the documentation. Outputs to `build/docs`
- `install` - Create a publishable maven repository for Chunky core. Outputs to `build/maven`
- `clean` - Cleans the project. Removes old builds.

A custom version can be specified with `-PnewVersion=""<version>""`. A custom prerelease tag can be specified with
`-PprereleaseTag=""<tag>""`. The default version is in the format: `{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{tag (DEV)}.{commits since last tag}.g{git hash of commit}`

Chunky is split into four subprojects:

- **chunky** - the core rendering and GUI project
- **lib** - common code required by the other projects
- **launcher** - the launcher
- **releasetools** - tool used for packaging releases

If you want to hack on Chunky itself you will need to load the `chunky` and
`lib` directories in your favorite editor. If available, use a Gradle project
import option.

### Code Style

The [Google Java style guide][google-styleguide] should be followed for new code (2 spaces for
indentation, no tabs). If you want to contribute code to Chunky please make
your code look similar to the rest of the code, and refer to the style guide
when in doubt.

## Features

* Full minecraft network setup using latest [paper-spigot](https://papermc.io/) and [waterfall](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall) builds.
  *Using other distrubutions, like forge, sponge or veolicty is completly up to you. Just edit the `globals.env`*
* Up and running standalone [dynmap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap.274/) configuration with custom subdomain.
* Ready to use [Player Analytics (Plan)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plan-player-analytics.32536/) integration with custom subdomain.
* Usage of the [official minecraft docker](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) images from itzg with all config options.
* Integrated [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) database with not exposed public port for enhanced security.
* [phpMyAdmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/) for accessing the database.
* [RCON Web Interface](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/rcon) for easy console access on the go.
* Full git workflow for managing configurations. Easy rollbacks and change tracking of all configurations.
* Replacement of sensentive config information when the server starts. See [itzg/minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server#replacing-variables-inside-configs) for details.
* Integrated [backup container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/silthus/mc-restic-compose-backup) for local, remote or cloud backups running every three hours by default.
* Minecraft world integrity is ensured when backing up by turning auto-save off before and on again after backup.
* Adding more servers to the network is as easy as copying some files.
* Integrated webserver on custom subdomain to host downloads, e.g. images, plugins.
* All webservers and external domains are HTTPS enforced and secured with a letsencrypt certificate.
* Development server to create a minimal clone of the production server.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the following packages are installed and working on your system:

* The latest version of [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
* The latest version of [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* *(Optional)*: **unzip** to download and unzip the initial plugins

## Getting started

1. Use this [repository as a template](https://github.com/Silthus/minecraft-server-template/generate) to create your own and then clone it:
   `git clone https://github.com/Silthus/minecraft-server-template.git`
2. Execute the `init.sh` script:  
   *The script asks you a couple of questions initializing your minecraft network.*  
   *It will also generate a couple of `*.secrets.env` files that **must never be commited!***
3. Start the network with `./dc.sh up -d`.

## Console & CMD

The console is accessible over a RCON webinterface or the `console.sh` script.

`main` is the name of the server the console should attach to.

```bash
./console.sh main
```

Additionally there is the option to directly execute commands without mounting the console using the `cmd.sh` script.

```bash
./cmd.sh main op Silthus
```

![console](.github/console.gif)

## Server

The server can be started `./dc.sh up -d` and stopped with `./dc.sh down`.
To restart the server container use `./dc.sh restart main`. Where `main` is again the name of the server container.

> At the start of the server all contents of `plugins/` are copied into the servers data directory and overwrite any config there.  
> Everything from `configs/` will be copied into the root data directory of the server.

All live data, worlds, flatfiles, plugins and so on live under the `servers/` directory. There you can also find the `latest.log` of the server.

```bash
less +F servers/main/logs/latest.log
```

Exit the log file with `CTRL+C Q`. See `man less` for more details.
As an alternative you can also attach to one or multiple of the docker containers.

```bash
./dc logs -f main proxy
```

### Directory layout

Here is an overview of the directory structure of your server nework. The `plugins` and `proxy-plugins` directory can be swapped with a git submodule if your server grows larger or you want to split the commit messsages and repository access.

| Directory | Details |
| ------- | -------- |
| `configs/` | Contains the base server configurations, e.g. `bukkit.yml`. The `server-properties` must be configured in the `/server-properties.env`. |
| `database/` | Contains the `MariaDB` database files. Do not touch them and don't include them in your git repository. |
| `downloads/` | An optional webserver to serve the latest zip file of your plugins for the local development server. |
| `dynmap/` | Contains the web and tiles directory of your dynmap render - if needed. |
| `plugins/` | All plugin configs that derive from the default configs should be placed and configured here. **Do not include flat file storage, like the Citiziens saves.yml!**. Drop your plugin `*.jar` files into this directory as well. |
| `proxy-plugins/` | This is the same as the `plugins/` directory, just for the bungeecord/velocity plugins. Drop your proxy plugin `*.jar` files into the directory. |
| `rcon/` | Contains the data of the rcon web interface. Do not touch it or include it in the git repository. |
| `schematics/` | A directory to share schematics across servers in your network. It must be mounted for each server and map to the WorldEdit schematics directory. |
| `scripts/` | Contains utlity scripts used by the `init.sh` script. Feel free to add your own and customize it to your liking. |
| `servers/` | Contains the flesh and bones of your server and holds all data. Do not commit them to the repository, but make sure to keep regular backups using the built-in restic backup or your own. |
| `docker-compose.*.yml` | There is one file for each service deployed in your minecraft network. Add or remove them as required. |
| `*.env` | The env files contain individual settings for each container, e.g. RAM, gamemode, etc. |
| `*.secrets.env` | Contains generated secrets for your network. **Do not commit them to source control!** |

### Updating plugin configs

All plugin configurations are located inside the `plugins/` directory and copied to the `servers/.../plugins/` on start of the server. Only place the configs that derive from the defaults. Do not place flat files in there, e.g. Citizens `saves.yml`. Files in the `plugins/` directory overwrite your files in the `servers/...` directory on startup.

You can use the [variable replacements](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server#replacing-variables-inside-configs) from the official `minecraft-docker` image.

Here is an example database configuration which will automatically replace the variables with your database credentials on startup. See the `globals.env` for details.

```yaml
database:
  type: ${CFG_DB_DRIVER}
  host: ${CFG_DB_HOST}
  port: ${CFG_DB_PORT}
  user: ${CFG_DB_USER}
  password: ${CFG_DB_PASSWORD}
  database: ${CFG_DB_NAME}
  url: ${CFG_DB_URL}
```

### Installing/Updating plugins

Drop the `.jar` files of your plugins into the `plugins/` directory. They will be copied together with the configs into the `servers/` directory on startup. Any old *.jar files will be removed. You can finetune the deletion depth in the `globals.env` with the `REMOVE_OLD_MODS_DEPTH` property.

By default this means that nested jar files, e.g. the ones from `PlaceholderAPI` will be deleted as well. Include them in the `plugins/` directory under `plugins/PlaceholderAPI/expansions/`.

After you updated plugins you can execute the `zip-plugins.sh` script to create a zip file of all of your plugins that is then available for download and use in the testserver.

### Adding more servers

You can add more servers any time. Just copy the `docker-compose.main.yml` and replace every occurance of `main` with your new server name. Create a custom `<your-server>.env` file to override additional properties and include in the in the `env-files:` part of the compose config. Also update the name of your world by setting the `LEVEL:` property.

Copy the `configs/main/` directory and adjust the `bukkit.yml` and so on.

Create a new empty directory with the name of your server under: `servers/<your-server>`.

## Database

The setup will deploy a [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) docker image with a random `root` and `minecraft` user password. Only the password of the minecraft user is stored in the `mysql.secrets.env`. You must look at the first startup log of the db container and note the root password to manually create new users: `./dc.sh logs db`.

There is also a phpyMyAdmin deployment available under `db.your-server.net`. You can login with the users above. Creating new users to access the database from the web is highly recommended.

## Dynmap

The stack will be deploy with a standalone dynmap webserver and dynmap has to be configured accordingly. To make things easier this template comes with a dynmap `configuration.txt` and preconfigured web directory that works out of the box.

To enable the dynmap integration download the [dynmap plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap.274/) and drop it into the `plugins/` directory. The dynmap can then be accessed using `https://map.your-server.net`.

## Player Analytics

Download the[player analytics](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plan-player-analytics.32536/) plugin drop it into the `plugins/` and `proxy-plugins/` directory. Restart your server and access PLAN under `plan.your-server.net`.

## Backup

The stack comes with a [restic](https://restic.readthedocs.io/) backup [sidecar container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/silthus/mc-restic-compose-backup) which allows configuring any number of [backup repositories](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html). [AWS glacier](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/) can be configured easily, as it is very cheap for huge amount of data.

By default backups are written into the `backup/` directory. Adjust the `backup.env` file to your liking. You can also add a discord webhook to one of your discord channels to get notified when a backup occured. This way you can quickly see if backups are successful or failing.

To get the status of your backups attach to the backup container and run `rcb status` and `rcb snapshots`.

``./backup.sh attach``

You can also use the `backup.sh` script to create an instant backup or cleanup the repository based on your retention times in `backup.env`.

* ``./backup.sh now`` - *Takes an instant backup.*
* ``./backup.sh cleanup`` - *Removes old snapshots freeing disk space.*
* ``./backup.sh snapshots`` - *Shows all backups.*
* ``./backup.sh attach`` - *Attaches to the backup container. Use the `rcb` command inside for more details.*

![backup](.github/backup.gif)

## Web Traefik

[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) is used to dynamically serve urls, create certificates and make the various web sites accessible under their subdomains.

## Developer Setup

One of the mail goals of this project was to make mirroring the production server to a development environment as easy as possible. At the same time should the local development environment not eat up all local resources. For that reason there is a `minimal.sh` setup of the server. It only serves the required docker services and makes the phpMyAdmin accessible on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) without login.

> All of the following steps must be executed inside a `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)` or Linux environment. `Docker for Windows` must also be installed and have the [WSL2 integration activated](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/). Depending on your system you must also activate CPU virtualization in your BIOS: [Troubleshooting Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization)

1. Clone this repository with the `--recursive` flag:
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Silthus/minecraft-server-template.git`
2. Execute the `init.sh` script:
   *The script asks you a couple of questions initializing your minecraft network.*
   *It will also generate a couple of `*secrets.env` files that **must never be commited!**
3. Delete all non required plugins (just `.jar` files) from the `plugins/` directory.
   *This will speed up the startup time of your server signifficantly.*
4. Start the development server with the `minimal.sh` script.  
   `./minimal.sh up -d`
5. Happy coding :)

### Logs and Reboot

The logs of the dev server can be viewed with `./minimal.sh logs -f minimal`.

The server can be restarted with `./minimal.sh restart minimal` and stopped with `./minimal.sh down`.

### phpMyAdmin

The dev server has an integrated phpMyAdmin webinterface without authentication. Simply access [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### OP Rights

You should give yourself OP rights after joining the server: `./minimal.sh exec minimal rcon-cli op <USER>`

If using luckperms use the following command: `./minimal.sh exec minimal rcon-cli lp user <USER> permission set luckperms.autoop`

### Copying plugins

To avoid the pesky manual copying of plugins a new gradle task was created: `other -> installPlugin`.
The task will automatically build and copy your plugin into the `plugins/` directory.

You need to include the following in your `build.gradle` to make this work. The `init.sh` script did the rest and copied the task from the `lib/scripts/` directory.

```groovy
if (project.hasProperty(""local_script"")) {
    apply from: file(local_script + ""/build.local.gradle"")
}
```

### Debugging

The development server started with `minimal.sh` will automatically expose the default remote debugging port under `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005`.

Here is how to setup IntelliJ with a remote debug task.

![step1](.github/remote_debug_1.png) ![step2](.github/remote_debug_2.png) ![step3](.github/remote_debug_3.png)

And then start your development server (`./minimal.sh up -d`) and attach to it using the task we just created.

# phantom

Makes hosted Bedrock/MCPE servers show up as LAN servers, specifically for consoles.

You can now play on remote servers (not Realms!) on your Xbox and PS4 with friends.

It's like having a LAN server that's not actually there, spooky.

## Installing

phantom is a command line application with no GUI (yet). See the usage section below.

[Download](https://github.com/jhead/phantom/releases) phantom from the releases page.

**macOS / Linux**

Add execute permissions if necessary:

```bash
$ chmod u+x ./phantom-<os>
```

Just replace `<os>` with macos, linux, etc. for the correct OS you're using.

## Usage

Open up a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS & Linux) to the location
where you downloaded phantom, then type in the phantom command and hit enter.
The server should show up on your LAN server list within a few seconds. If not,
you did something wrong. Or I did ;)

```
Usage: ./phantom-<os> [options] -server <server-ip>

Options:
  -6	Optional: Enables IPv6 support on port 19133 (experimental)
  -bind string
    	Optional: IP address to listen on. Defaults to all interfaces. (default ""0.0.0.0"")
  -bind_port int
    	Optional: Port to listen on. Defaults to 0, which selects a random port.
    	Note that phantom always binds to port 19132 as well, so both ports need to be open.
  -debug
    	Optional: Enables debug logging
  -remove_ports
    	Optional: Forces ports to be excluded from pong packets (experimental)
  -server string
    	Required: Bedrock/MCPE server IP address and port (ex: 1.2.3.4:19132)
  -timeout int
    	Optional: Seconds to wait before cleaning up a disconnected client (default 60)
```

**Example**

Connect to a server at IP `lax.mcbr.cubed.host` port `19132`:

```bash
./phantom-<os> -server lax.mcbr.cubed.host:19132
```

![fVoNSdU](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/360153/85956959-18003880-b93e-11ea-811e-424b33b98528.png)

Same as above but bind to a specific local IP:

```bash
./phantom-<os> -bind 10.0.0.5 -server lax.mcbr.cubed.host:19132
```

Same as above but bind the proxy server to port 19133:
   
```bash
./phantom-<os> -bind_port 19133 -server lax.mcbr.cubed.host:19132
```

Same as above but bind the proxy server to local IP 10.0.0.5 and port 19133:
   
```bash
./phantom-<os> -bind 10.0.0.5 -bind_port 19133 -server lax.mcbr.cubed.host:19132
```

**Running multiple instances**

If you have multiple Bedrock servers, you can run phantom multiple times on
the same device to allow all of your servers to show up on the LAN list. All
you have to do is start one instance of phantom for each server and set the
`-server` flag appropriately. You don't need to use `-bind` or change the port.
But you probably do need to make sure you have a firewall rule that allows
all UDP traffic for the phantom executable.

**A note on `-bind`:**

The port is randomized by default and specifically omitted from the flag because
the port that phantom runs on is irrelevant to the user. phantom must bind to
port 19132 on all interfaces (or at least the broadcast address) to receive
ping packets from LAN devices. So phantom will always do that and there's no
way to configure otherwise, but you can also pick which IP you want the proxy
itself to listen on, just in case you need that. You shouldn't though.

As long as the device you run phantom from is on the same LAN, the default
settings should allow other LAN devices to see it when you open Minecraft.

**A note on `-bind_port`:**

The port used by the proxy server can be defined with the `-bind_port` flag.
It can be useful if you are behind a firewall or using Docker and want to open only
necessary ports to phantom. Note that you'll always need to open port 19132 in addition
to the bind port for phantom to work.

This flag can be used with or without the `-bind` flag. 
Default value is 0, which means a random port will be used.

## Building

Makefile builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux, including x86 and ARM.

```bash
make
```

## How does this work?

On Minecraft platforms that support LAN servers, the game will broadcast a
server ping packet to every device on the same network and display any valid
replies as connectable servers. This tool runs on your computer - desktop,
laptop, Raspberry Pi, etc. - and pretends to be a LAN server, acting as a proxy,
passing all traffic from your game through your computer and to the server
(and back), so that Minecraft thinks you're connected to a LAN server, but
you're really playing on a remote server. As soon as you start it up, you should
see the fake server listed under LAN and, upon selecting it, connect to the real
Bedrock/MCPE server hosted elsewhere.

For an optimal experience, run this on a device that is connected via ethernet
and not over WiFi, since a wireless connection could introduce some lag. Your
game device can be connected to WiFi. Your remote server can be running on a
computer, a VM, or even with a Minecraft hosting service.

## Supported platforms

- This tool should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- ARM builds are available for Raspberry Pi and similar SOCs.
- Minecraft for Windows 10, iOS/Android, Xbox One, and PS4 are currently supported.
- **Nintendo Switch is not supported.**

Note that you almost definitely need to create a firewall rule for this to work.
On macOS, you'll be prompted automatically. On Windows, you may need to go into
your Windows Firewall settings and open up all UDP ports for phantom.

## Troubleshooting

**My server isn't showing up on the list but it's online and phantom is showing connections!**

Make sure ""Visible to LAN players"" is turn **ON** in your server's settings: *(below shows setting OFF)*

[Documentation, Guides & API](https://william278.net/docs/husksync) · [Resource Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/husksync.97144/) · [Bug Reports](https://github.com/WiIIiam278/HuskSync/issues)

**HuskSync** is a modern, cross-server player data synchronisation system that enables the comprehensive synchronisation of your user's data across multiple proxied servers. It does this by making use of Redis and MySQL to optimally cache data while players change servers.

## Features
![Data snapshot viewer](images/data-snapshot-viewer.png)

- Synchronise inventories, ender chests, advancements, statistics, experience points, health, max health, hunger, saturation, potion effects, persistent data container tags, game mode, location and more across multiple proxied servers. 
- Create and manage ""snapshot"" backups of user data and roll back users to previous states on-the-fly. (`/userdata`)
- Preview, list, delete, restore & pin user data snapshots in-game with an intuitive menu.
- Examine the contents of player's inventories and ender chests on-the-fly. (`/inventory`, `/enderchest`)
- Hooks with your [Player Analytics](https://github.com/plan-player-analytics/Plan) web panel to provide an overview of user data.
- Supports segregating synchronisation across multiple distinct clusters on one network.

## Requirements
* A MySQL Database (v8.0+).
* A Redis Database (v5.0+)
* Any number of proxied Spigot servers (Minecraft v1.16.5+, Java 16+)

## Setup
1. Place the plugin jar file in the `/plugins/` directory of each Spigot server. You do not need to install HuskSync as a proxy plugin.
2. Start, then stop every server to let HuskSync generate the config file.
3. Navigate to the HuskSync config file on each server (`~/plugins/HuskSync/config.yml`) and fill in both the MySQL and Redis database credentials.
4. Start every server again and synchronization will begin.

## Building
To build HuskSync, simply run the following in the root of the repository:
```
./gradlew clean build
```

var launcher = new CMLauncher(path);

// show launch progress to console
launcher.FileChanged += (e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine(""[{0}] {1} - {2}/{3}"", e.FileKind.ToString(), e.FileName, e.ProgressedFileCount, e.TotalFileCount);
};
launcher.ProgressChanged += (s, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine(""{0}%"", e.ProgressPercentage);
};

var versions = await launcher.GetAllVersionsAsync();
foreach (var item in versions)
{
    // show all version names
    // use this version name in CreateProcessAsync method.
    Console.WriteLine(item.Name);
}

var launchOption = new MLaunchOption
{
    MaximumRamMb = 1024,
    Session = session, // replace this with login session value. ex) Session = MSession.GetOfflineSession(""hello"")

This is a Minecraft mod which implements a Level-of-Detail (LoD) terrain renderer into the game.
The name is in reference to [Foghrye4's CWGFarPlaneView](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cwg-far-plane-view), which is an addon for CubicWorldGen (which, in turn, is an addon for Cubic Chunks) which renders a plane at sea level with block and biome colors, and served as the original inspiration for me to make this.
**This mod is a work in progress! If you do decide to download this, don't expect stuff to work correctly because it probably won't.**

**Remember to [Read the FAQ first](https://github.com/PorkStudios/FarPlaneTwo/wiki/FAQ)**!

## Installation
*This is a Forge mod for Minecraft 1.12.2. Other versions WILL be supported in the future.*
1) Install [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html) for Minecraft 1.12.2.
2) [Download](https://jenkins.daporkchop.net/job/PorkStudios/job/FarPlaneTwo/job/master/) the mod.
3) Download these dependencies too:
   - [ForgeRocks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgerocks)
   - [Mixin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-0-7-0-8-compatibility)

For best results use cubic chunks and cubic world gen and set the world type to custom cubic.

(Cubic Chunks bundles Mixin inside it, so don't use both cubic chunks and mixin together.)
   - [Cubic Chunks](https://jenkins.daporkchop.net/job/OpenCubicChunks/job/CubicChunks/)
   - [Cubic World Gen](https://jenkins.daporkchop.net/job/OpenCubicChunks/job/CubicWorldGen/)

Some of the above pages should look a lot like this:

![download1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25571687/119328744-49aa7e00-bc39-11eb-827f-f44611c8ae4e.png)

There can be a lot of links on these pages. Click on the first one underneath ""Last Successful Artifacts"".


## Goals and Motivations

My end goal is to achieve the following:

- be able to use render distances of *at least* 100 thousand blocks
- cause at most a 25% decrease in performance when using my i5-2520M's integrated graphics
- be compatible with [Cubic Chunks](https://github.com/OpenCubicChunks/CubicChunks)
- be as compatible as reasonably possible with other mods

I have exactly zero concern with doing stuff that is unsafe: for instance, [the client-side render tree](https://github.com/PorkStudios/FarPlaneTwo/blob/master/src/main/java/net/daporkchop/fp2/mode/common/client/FarRenderTree.java), which the renderer traverses when deciding which tiles to render each frame, is implemented entirely using off-heap memory.

At some point (once the internals of the mod are more polished) I'll probably write up a big section here describing exactly how a lot of the stuff works.

# Dynamic FPS

Dynamic FPS automatically reduces the speed at which minecraft renders when it's not focused (to 1 FPS) or hidden (no renders at all). It also fixes a bug in Vanilla Minecraft that makes it take much more performance in the background than it should.

Download in [the releases section](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), or on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).

**McDeob** is a re-mapping and deobfuscation tool for Minecraft server/client jars.   
This tool will download the appropriate Minecraft server/client jar along with the mappings for that version, 
then it will proceed to remap the jar and optionally decompile it. Simply unzip that file to find all your remapped/decompiled Minecraft code.

## Requirements
- A computer
- Java 16+
- A few minutes of your time

## Running
Details for installing and running **McDeob** can be found on the [**WIKI**](https://github.com/ShaneBeeStudios/McDeob/wiki)

### Note:
The remapping process takes around 2 minutes (give or take). Whilst its remapping you will see the progress in the app.   
The decompiling process takes about 3 minutes (give or take). Currently there is no progress in the app, so just wait til the app says its completed.    
(These numbers are based on a test run on my Mac (MacbookPro with M1 chip), times may vary on other machines.)

### SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE
The files output by this app are for your own personal use only.   
The mappings used to decompile are provided by Mojang, but come with a hefty copyright from Microsoft.   
You can use these files personally however you see fit, but you are not permitted to distribute them, since they do contain proprietery Minecraft code.    
That said, you may **NOT** upload the resulting files to something like GitHub.

## Preview
![](https://i.imgur.com/eOSuIGr.png)

## Compiling
If you wish to compile this yourself, simply clone the repo and run `mvn clean package`.   
Super Simple!!!

## Tools
This application uses 2 different tools for the processing of the jar files
1) [**Reconstruct by LXGaming**](https://github.com/LXGaming/Reconstruct) = This tool remaps the Minecraft jar using Minecraft's mappings. 
2) [**Fernflower**](https://github.com/fesh0r/fernflower) = This tool is used to decompile the jar file (class files) into usable .java files.

## License
This tool shades in both [**Reconstruct by LXGaming**](https://github.com/LXGaming/Reconstruct) and [**Fernflower**](https://github.com/fesh0r/fernflower),
please see their repos for the appropriate licenses.

## 🚀 A blazing fast alternative renderer for Minecraft
### Discord
https://discord.gg/NTuK8bQ2hn
### Matrix
https://matrix.to/#/#wgpu-mc:matrix.org

#### Intro

`wgpu` is a crate implementing the WebGPU specification in Rust. It's primary backends are Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal.

#### Goals

wgpu-mc is a standalone, mostly-batteries-included rendering engine written in Rust.
Electrum is a fabric mod that integrates wgpu-mc with Minecraft.

#### Current status

Both the engine and Electrum are both currently under active development.
wgpu-mc is fairly mature, while Electrum needs more development. The whole project is 
WIP, so something may work one day then be rewritten the next.
Terrain rendering works somewhat, while entities are still entirely un-integrated in Electrum.
A publicly testable release of the mod should be out Soonish.

#### WIP and Completed Features

- [ ] Particles

Pie in the sky

- [ ] Use https://github.com/birbe/jvm to run Minecraft in the browser"
950,Choonster-Minecraft-Mods/MinecraftModDecompiler,Java,"# Discontinued
This project has been discontinued. I recommend using [BON2](https://github.com/tterrag1098/BON2) to deobfuscate mods and a regular Java decompiler to decompile them.

# Minecraft Mod Decompiler
Decompiles and deobfuscates all Minecraft Forge mods in a specified directory and outputs the source files to another directory.

Please respect the individual mod licenses when using this tool.

## Supported Platforms
This tool uses [JD-Core-java](https://github.com/nviennot/jd-core-java) for decompilation.

JD itself supports:
- Linux 32/64-bit
- Windows 32/64-bit
- Mac OSX 32/64-bit on x86 hardware

## Build
Clone the repository and run `gradlew build`. This will generate two JAR files in the `build/libs` directory:
- `MinecraftModDecompiler-<version>.jar`, which contains only this tool
- `MinecraftModDecompiler-<version>-withdeps.jar`, which contains this tool and all of its dependencies

The `idea` and `eclipse` Gradle plugins are included in the build script, so you can run `gradlew idea` or `gradlew eclipse` to generate an IDE project.

## Usage
```shell
java -jar MinecraftModDecompiler.jar [options]
  Options:
  * -mappingsDirectory
       The directory containing the MCP mapping files (fields.csv and methods.csv)
  * -modDirectory
       The directory containing the mods to decompile
  * -outputDirectory
       The directory to output the decompiled classes to
```

For convenience, the included `MCModDecompiler` batch/shell scripts can be run with the same arguments after building in a cloned repository.

The MCP mapping files can be found in the [MCP releases](http://www.modcoderpack.com/website/releases) under the `conf` directory. If you've set up a ForgeGrqadle workspace, you can also find the mapping files in your Gradle cache (`~/.gradle/caches/minecraft/net/minecraftforge/forge/<forge_version>/unpacked/conf` for Minecraft 1.7.2 and later).

## License
MinecraftModDecompiler is released under the MIT license. See `LICENSE.txt` for details.

JD-IntelliJ (included with JD-Core-java) is free for non-commercial use. This means that JD-IntelliJ shall not be included or embedded into commercial software products. Nevertheless, this tool may be freely used for personal needs in a commercial or non-commercial environments.

953,amalbansode/Discord-Minecraft-Bot,JavaScript,"# Discord Minecraft Bot


## Introduction
This is a Node.js script for a Discord bot. Based on [MineStat](https://github.com/ldilley/minestat), the bot checks the status of user-specified Minecraft servers and returns the number of players online.

## Installation
This requires Node.js to be installed on your system, along with primary dependencies discord.js and minestat.js.

### Setting up for use with Node.js
1. Install Node.js and npm on your system. (You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) binary.)
2. Clone this repository and place it in a folder. (Use `git clone https://github.com/amalbansode/Minecraft-Discord-Bot`)
2. In terminal, navigate to this folder.
	```bash
	$ cd location/of/your/Minecraft-Discord-Bot
	```
3. Install the latest `discord.js` using npm.
	```bash
	$ npm i -S discord.js # You can remove the -S because npm now automatically saves it to package.json
	```

### Setting up a Discord Application
1. [Create a Discord Application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) for the purpose of this bot. Setup a Discord account if you do not have one yet.
2. Give the application/bot a name and description.
3. Navigate to the ‘Bot’ section. Reveal your bot’s token, and copy it.
4. Open `auth.json`, which is contained in the same folder as `bot.js`.
5. Paste your token within the double quotes corresponding to the ""token"" key, and save `auth.json`.
6. Now, with Terminal open in the same directory as before, run
	```bash
	$ node bot.js
	```
7. The output should say the following. If so, you have setup the bot correctly.
	```
	Logged in as <your bot’s discord tag>!
	Ready...
	```
8. Exit the application using a keyboard escape (typically `control/command + C`).

### Adding the bot to a server
1. On the [Dicord Chat Client](https://discordapp.com/channels/), click the '+' icon on the left side and create a new server for testing the bot. Skip this step if you manage a pre-existing server you want the bot to be added to.
2. On the Discord Develper Portal for your bot, navigate to the section titled ‘OAuth2’. Scroll down to view the OAuth2 URL Generator.
3. Check the following boxes: 
	* In Scopes, _bot_
	* In Bot Permissions, _Send Messages_ and _Read Message History_
4. A URL must have been generated above. Follow this URL in a new browser tab.
5. Specify the server you would like to add the bot to (this could be the one you created in step 1, or a pre-existing server).
6. Verify the permissions stated, and click ‘Authorize’.
7. The bot should now be a member of your specified server.
8. Start the bot in Terminal again
	```bash
	$ node bot.js
	```
9. In the Discord chat window for this server, enter ‘!ip’ and check for output in your Discord chat.

## Features

### Player count display
The number of players on the server is displayed as the bot’s activity in the ‘Users‘ list on the right side.

![Discord Bot Activity shows player count](/images/discord_activity.png)

### Printing the list of server IPs in chat
The IP details of servers can be displayed in Discord chat by typing `!ip` into Discord chat. The bot will reply to the user invoking the command.

![Discord Bot replies with list of IPs to servers](/images/discord_reply.png)

## Configuration

### Changing the servers to be checked
1. Stop the bot if it is running. Open `bot.js` in a text-editing program.
2. Navigate to line _33_, which contains the dictionary type variable `servIP`.
3. By default, the dictionary contains the IP Address for the MInecraft Hypixel server.
	```javascript
	const servIP = {
	    hypixel: 'mc.hypixel.net:25565',
	    // 'your title': 'your.ip:port',
	};
	```
4. Modify this dictionary to follow the template, keeping the title(s) and IP Address(es) within single quotation (') marks, separated by a colon (:) mark. The order of servers in this dictionary list will be preserved in the bot’s output.

### Changing the frequency of checking servers' status
1. By default, the bot checks the status of servers every four minutes.
2. To modify this, change the variable `refreshEvery` on line _29_ to the number of minutes between every refresh. Use a floating point numeral if required.

Note: The bot being asynchronous, however, will require at least `the number of servers times 2.5` seconds to fetch the statuses of all servers at once. This time interval can be reduced, but it is suggested that this remain as it is to prevent any malfunctioning.

## FAQs
**There's no port specified for my Minecraft server**

The standard port for Minecraft servers is typically _25565_.

**Does the bot run forever?**

No, the bot goes offline when you close Terminal or end the process on your system. You could host the bot on AWS or Heroku, following the same steps as above, instead. The bot can be kept online using the _forever_ module. Check out [this guide](https://shiffman.net/a2z/bot-ec2/) on the usage of AWS.

#ATTENTION#

Primary development has moved to the opencog/opencog-to-minecraft repo,
[here](https://github.com/opencog/opencog-to-minecraft). The code here
no longer quite works.  Please go there to get the most current version!

#opencog-to-minecraft#

A ROS-based module linking OpenCog and the Minecraft world. This code serves as a starting point for integrating the two environments. The code is in a 'heavy experimentation' phase, and will therefore change drastically over the next couple of months. The steps to set up and run the module are currently rather complicated, but this will change as the code stabilizes.

For now this repository are mainly made and managed by [LucidBlue](https://github.com/LucidBlue) and [chenesan](https://github.com/chenesan). Later this repo may be included under the [Opencog](https://github.com/opencog).

##Prerequisite##

####Ubuntu http://www.ubuntu.com

It's recommended to set up environment under [Ubuntu Trusty](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/).

You can also use the [Opencog docker container](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Building_OpenCog#Docker_.2864_bit_systems_only.29), which containing Ubuntu Trusty and Opencog. Note that when starting a docker container, you have to publish port 25565 to make the Minecraft Server in the container use the port 25565 in your machine:

`docker create --name opencog -p 25565:25565-p 17001:17001 -p 5000:5000 -it $USER/opencog`

####ROS http://www.ros.org/

Now(20150823) ROS indigo distro is OK and recommended for Minecraft embodiment. Not sure if other distro will work or not.

Install instruction of ROS indigo is [here](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu).

After installing ROS you have to create a workspace ([tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)) and install the minecraft_bot package by the instruction in [official tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/CreatingPackage) and [minecraft_bot/README](https://github.com/OC2MC/opencog-to-minecraft/tree/master/minecraft_bot).

####Octomap http://wiki.ros.org/octomap

In ubuntu you can directly install Octomap by:

`sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-octomap

(Assume you have setuped the sources.list when you install ROS, or you will fail to find the package.)

If you are not using ROS indigo distro, just change the `ros-indigo-octomap` to `ros-your_distro-octomap`

####Opencog https://github.com/opencog/opencog

There are some Octomap codes in Opencog side has not been pulled into Opencog official repository. So you have to add all of files under [opencog-to-minecraft/opencog](https://github.com/OC2MC/opencog-to-minecraft/tree/master/opencog)) in the same place in your Opencog code base manually.

Because for now(2015-08-23) the new OctoMap breaks the old embodiment, so it will FAIL to build the whole Opencog. To make this Minecraft embodiment work, we only need to partially build Opencog Space/TimeServer, spacetime-types, SpaceMap and cython binding,

So, after adding files under your opencog directory, build it by following procedure (assume the working directory is under your Opencog):

    mkdir build
    cmake ..
    cd build
    cd ../spatial
    make
    cd ../spacetime
    make
    cd ../cython/opencog
    make


Before installing Opencog you have to install [atomspace](https://github.com/opencog/atomspace) and [cogutils](https://github.com/opencog/cogutils). Just install them by the instruction in README.

####Minecraft server(official) https://minecraft.net/download

Install instuction of Minecraft server is [here](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Setting_up_a_server)

You can also choose other Minecraft server manager you prefer.

####Spock https://github.com/SpockBotMC/SpockBot

A python API to connect with Minecraft server.

##Step to run##

It's recommended to use `tmux or `screen to run multiple ROS nodes in multiple terminal if you use Opencog docker container.

1. add the following PYTHONPATH:

    `/usr/local/share/opencog/python`

    `/your_opencog/build/opencog/cython/`

    `/your_opencog-to-minecraft/`

   and setup the ROS environment:

    `roscore &`
    `source /where_you_create_catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash`

   and set up your path to action schema, in opencog_python_eval.conf:
   
   `PYTHON_PRELOAD_FUNCTIONS = /path/to/your/minecraft_obt/src/action_schemas.py`

2. Start Minecraft Server.

3. Follow instructions in [minecraft_bot](https://github.com/OC2MC/opencog-to-minecraft/tree/master/minecraft_bot) to start ROS nodes and initialize Spock. Now you should see the bot appeared in your Minecraft. You can find the bot by move to the place bot spawned(showed in the Minecraft Server).

4. Start the opencog_initializer.py.

5. You should see the bot start to move toward 90 degree directions(you can see the information by pressing F3 in your Minecraft client.)

6. Put a ""Gold"" block in front of the bot.

7. You should see the bot stops and walks toward the block. The bot is attracted by the target gold block. Then the bot leaves the gold block and keep going since as time going the attention value of block decreases. For now (20150822) that's all behaviors of the bot.

##TODO##

* Document all the code.

* Add more actions in actions ROS node and Opencog: mining, placing block, inventing items and more and more and more.

* Add more percetions in middle ROS node and Opencog: Entity, items, chat message and more and more and more.

* More visibility: For testing now we confine the bot's FOV so it only can get what it sees in near distance(distance < 10). It's great if we can make it see further and more accurate.

* Use the existing [planner](https://github.com/opencog/opencog/blob/master/opencog/embodiment/Control/OperationalAvatarController/OCPlanner.h) and [pathfinding](https://github.com/opencog/opencog/blob/master/opencog/spatial/3DSpaceMap/Pathfinder3D.cc) module in the action generator. Cython binding seems a possible way.

* Use the idmap in minecraft_bot/src/embodiment-testing/ to replace the block id in perception manager. So we can have a useful atom name.

* Pass every message to Opencog with the ROS/Minecraft timestamp to record the timestamp in atomspace/TimeServer correctly.

* add a void block handle in SpaceMap to distinguish the ""unknown"" block and the ""air"" block. (For example, if we only use Handle::UNDEFINED to express all non-void block, what does it mean when we get a undefined handle from spaceMap::get_block(position)? Does it mean (1) we've known there's no block in this position? or (2) we haven't record block in this position and we don't know if there's a block in the embodied environment?) To distinguish it, I guess it's better to use different block handle to distinguish void and unknown block.

* write a script for starting all of the things(ROS nodes/Spock/Opencog/Minecraft server) in differenct terminal(using tmux/screen)

* There are more subtle TODOs in the codes...We should move them to the github issues.

* Powerful **REST-API**
* Support for **Spigot**, **BungeeCord** and **Velocity**
* Template-System

<br />

## Dashboard

SimpleCloud provides a **Dashboard accessible** for every user.
The domain for the **Dashboard** is: **http://dashboard-nossl.thesimplecloud.eu**.
Now you have to enter the **IP-Address** of your server follwed by the port of the **REST-Module.**
<br />
<br />
The default port of the **REST-Module** is **8585**. So an ip would be **55.55.55.55:8585**. <br />
The username and password can be found in **""modules/rest/users.json""**

<br />

## Modules

SimpleCloud provides some modules by default.

### Internal-Wrapper

The **Internal-Wrapper Module** starts a wrapper every time the manager of the cloud gets started.
This wrapper does only run when the manager is running. It connects **automatically** with no need to set it up.
The wrapper will be automatically named **""InternalWrapper""** and it will have **2GB of memory**.
<br />
You can **download**
it [here](https://repo.thesimplecloud.eu/artifactory/gradle-release-local/eu/thesimplecloud/simplecloud/simplecloud-module-internalwrapper/2.4.0/simplecloud-module-internalwrapper-2.4.0.jar)
<br />

To edit the memory of the wrapper you can use the command: <br />
``edit wrapper InternalWrapper maxMemory <amount in MB>``

<br />

### Signs

The **Sign Module** is used to show available services for players in the lobby via a **sign**.
The players can click on that sign and will be sent to the server. The layout of the signs is **fully customizable**.
<br />
You can **download**
it [here](https://repo.thesimplecloud.eu/artifactory/gradle-release-local/eu/thesimplecloud/simplecloud/simplecloud-module-sign/2.4.0/simplecloud-module-sign-2.4.0.jar)

Install and update mods from ~~CurseForge~~ and Modrinth through a simple command.

## News — Slow progress and an Alternative CLI (2022-08-02)

Hi everyone!

I have acquired a CurseForge API key, but still want to make it easy to install mods from CurseForge
without applying for a key.

Maybe that's not possible, but I have some ideas at least for improving `mcman`.
This includes downloading mods from CurseForge.

For now though, I can point you to an awesome and in my opinion, better alternative: [ferium](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/ferium).

Cheers,
Senth

_[(News Archive)](./NEWS.md)_

## Features

- Install mods with `minecraft-mod-manager install mod_name`
- Update all mods with `minecraft-mod-manager update`, `mcman update` or `mmm update`
- Searches on CurseForge and Modrinth for updates on installed mods
- Filter updates by
  - Stable (default), beta `--beta`, or alpha `--alpha` releases
  - Minecraft version `-v 1.16.4`
  - Fabric/Forge mod `--mod-loader fabric`

## Installation/Upgrade & Requirements

1. Requires at least python 3.8
1. Install/Upgrade with `$ pip install --user --upgrade minecraft-mod-manager`

=========
This license is intended to fix some of the problems and loopholes in the original [MMPL](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/blob/6.1.x/buildcraft_resources/LICENSE.txt), and in general make a modder-friendly, easily usable Open Source license for mods of all types.

Please keep in mind that this is currently very work-in-progress. Ideas, tweaks, working adjustments, and partial rewrites are happening as members of the modding community contribute ideas or express concerns.  
Once we've got a version that we're comfortable with, @jakimfett is going to have his lawyer read it and suggest changes for purposes of clarity and legality.

Thanks for your patience while we work through this process.

License Purpose
=========
This license intends to provide an easy to understand, relatively permissive license that addresses a number of fairly tricky constraints.
* Mod authors disappear, and the license doesn't allow anyone to build on their work
* People think a mod is cool, but can't determine if they're allowed to use it in modpacks
* Malicious and/or greedy individuals exploit mod popularity for profit, out of spite, or to spread malware
* Mod authors are hesitant to accept contributions due to potential complications with unclear contribution guidelines

This license is intended as a non-commercial, visible source, legally enforcable tool that encourages the author's creative process, allows the end user to have fun, and generally makes the modding community a better place.

What if you could put mods on a server, without needing it on the client?  
Well, that's impossible. But we can try! *Nothing is impossible!*

**Note:** if you're a mod developer looking to make a mod that'll be solely used serverside, you might want to consider [Polymer](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer). It has some advantages and disadvantages over PolyMc.

## How PolyMc works
PolyMc is unique in that it operates on packet level. This means PolyMc doesn't touch the mechanics of the mod at all.
The server is *genuinely modded*. This results in the server being quite stable, all the hacks PolyMc does to display things
are separated from what's actually happening. 

PolyMc uses a host of techniques to automatically try and display your modded things. PolyMc also features a large api
to customize how items/blocks/entities/whatevers are transformed.

## Building
Run `./gradlew runDatagen` once. Then just run `./gradlew build`

Version 2.2.8 is out 2022-12-24

[![Build Status](http://jenkins.usrv.eu:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=GTNewHorizons%20Configs)](http://jenkins.usrv.eu:8080/job/GTNewHorizons%20Configs/)

## What is GT New Horizons?

<p align=""justify"">
    You are looking at a big progressive kitchensink pack for Minecraft 1.7.10 balanced around the mod GregTech.<BR><BR>
    Over 7 years of development (and still going) have formed a balance and refinement that only a handful of packs can keep up with. We are talking about thousands of recipe tweaks, a massive questbook with over 3000 quests, unique world generation, custom mods coded for the pack, custom Thaumonomicon pages, and many more.
    The main intentions of the pack are a long-lasting experience and tying mods together in a progressive fashion, making it feel more like a single game than a compilation of mods thrown together.<BR><BR>
    To reach this goal, GT New Horizons is using the tiers (basically ages of technology) from GregTech and allocates content of other mods to a fitting point within the progression.<BR><BR>
    Starting in the stone age you will barely be able to survive until you get your first steam machines and, eventually, reach electricity. Later on, you will have to visit other planets and dimensions to gather important resources and fight mighty bosses to channel their magical power.<BR><BR>
    If you are a fan of expert mode packs and want to take it to the next level this pack will be your friend!

## What does this pack have to offer?

***Technology***<BR>

<p align=justify>
    GregTech on its own comes with a huge tech tree using the EU system and the other technology-based mods will open up while you are progressing through the tiers.<BR>
    <BR>
    The main cables of GregTech convert EU to RF so you don't have to worry about different energy systems and things feeling incompatible.<BR>
    <BR>
    Complex processing lines, automation, a large variety in power generation and a lot of materials to work with create an environment with many possibilities that the player has to explore.<BR>
    <BR>
    Crossbreeding plants, bees and crops with Forestry and IndustrialCraft2, setting up mob farms using EnderIO and Draconic Evolution, and general infrastructure improvements with Railcraft and Applied Energistics - it's all there, anything you want (and need!) if you enjoy the technical aspect of modded Minecraft.
</p>

***Magic***<BR> 

<p align=""justify"">
    GT New Horizons comes with a variety of powerful magic mods. Your main access will be through the Thauminomicon which is modified to also feature custom sections for Blood Magic, Witchery, and other important things besides having the usual content of Thaumcraft and its add-ons.<BR>
    <BR>
    The Twilight Forest is the dimension linked to magic in this pack and you will have to explore and defeat the bosses to progress in magic. Later on, there is power generation with essentia and options to store it using your AE system connecting technology with magic.
</p>

***Exploration***<BR>

<p align=""justify"">
    Using Realistic World Gen along with Biomes O' Plenty creates a beautiful terrain in the overworld.<BR>
    <BR>
    Besides all the biomes and natural structures you can find there will be challenging Rogue-like Dungeons that come with decent loot and spawners you might want to use in creative ways.<BR>
    <BR>
    In the early game, villages offer a nice resting spot while looking for the optimal base location. Later you will revisit the villages to trade for key items and scavenge for parts. Eventually, you may end up relocating villagers closer to you - or taking over a village yourself.
</p>

***Put the mining back in Minecraft*** <BR>

<p align=""justify""> 
    GregTech spawns ore in large localized veins rather than small clusters of everything, rewarding long searches with a huge vein that can sustain your base's growth for a long time.<BR>
    <BR>
    In most packs, nearly everything spawns in the overworld which is not the case in GT New Horizons, and you are encouraged to mine in other dimensions such as the Twilight Forest, the nether, the end and (later on) even on other planets to make your way to the endgame. Unlocking things by mining for materials on other planets will create that situation where Galacticraft all of a sudden becomes important to progress which feels really rewarding.<BR>
</p>

***Survival***<BR>

<p align=""justify"">
    The first few days and nights will be rough, in fact, nights will stay rough for a while since hardcore darkness makes them pitch black without any light sources or potion effects, so you might want to get a bed quickly!<BR>
    <BR>
    Food is a critical thing early game and you can't keep eating the same things because of Spice of Life. Better watch out for some gardens from Pam's Harvestcraft to get some variety into your nutrition!<BR>
    <BR>
    Be prepared to face strong mobs that can cause death quickly if you play without any strategy.<BR>
    <BR>
    Facing them with better gear will make life easier once you progress but until then light up your base - there are plenty of options available from Chisel, Project Red, Ztones and Floodlights.<BR>
</p>

***Questing***<BR>
<p align=""justify"">
    GT New Horizons comes with over 1300 quests that will guide the player through the maze that modded Minecraft can be.<BR>
    <BR>
    The texts will inform you what's required to progress so you don't have to watch tutorials or ask others as often. The questbook can even save you the time to type into NEI, just click the items displayed in the quest and it will display the recipe through NEI, quite handy, right?<BR>
    <BR>
    Custom lootbags and the coin system make for unique and helpful rewards. And we all enjoy the gamble from time to time.
</p>

***Is this a game for newbies?***<BR>

<p align=""justify"">
    Newbies to Minecraft? Definitely not. Newbies to modded Minecraft?  Maybe.  The questbook is a great introduction to the variety and type of mods available. With each mod, gated players must learn about the mod to make the most of it while waiting for the next mod to unlock.
</p>

***Is this modpack for me?***<BR>

<p align=""justify"">
    Does the thought of earning that top-end gear over weeks or months appeal to you? The usual packs feel like they are over in 1 or 2 weeks since you get OP gear so quickly?<BR>
    <BR>
    How about designing a chemical processing system to rival a real oil refinery, with multiple inputs creating dozens of outputs and intermediate products to finally make a bar of plastic, rubber, explosives or other top-end gear?<BR>
    <BR>
    Does the sound of machinery processing ore via crushing, washing, centrifuging, smelting in a blast furnace, and cooling off in a vacuum freezer tickle your brain?<BR>
    <BR>
    Then this is the pack for you.<BR>
    <BR>
    Your pick is not ready.<BR>
    <BR>
    Welcome home.<BR>

969,minecraft-addon-tools/minecraft-addon-toolchain,JavaScript,"# Notice

Mojang has deprecated the bedrock scripting API in favour of the GameTest API. This repository has been archived as a a result.

# minecraft-addon-toolchain

Helps with some common tasks when building a minecraft mod for Bedrock edition:

-   builds `.mcpack` and `.mcaddon` packages
-   installs the mod into Minecraft for Windows 10's development folders
-   watches for file changes and reinstalls as necessary
-   has extension points to do transpilation

## Prerequisites

| Software  | Minimum                                                 | Recommended                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Minecraft | Minecraft Bedrock Edition Beta                          | Minecraft Bedrock Edition Beta on your Windows 10 device  |
| Storage   | 1.0 GB of free space for text editor, game, and scripts | 3.0 GB of free space for Visual Studio, game, and scripts |
| Node.js   | 8.x                                                     | 10.x                                                      |

Scripting in Minecraft is currently only officially supported on Windows 10 Bedrock Edition Beta, however there have been reports that users have been able to use alternative launchers to get scripting working on other platforms, and although the toolchain attempts to support Linux, Mac OS and Android, they are currently untested and support for these platforms is limited. (I am happy to take PRs to improve the experience)

### Getting the Bedrock Edition Beta

Mojang provides instructions on how to get into the Beta program here: [How to get into Minecraft betas](https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/how-get-minecraft-betas)

## Getting Started

Ensure you have a package.json file present in your development directory, if you do not, you can create a minimal valid package with the following contents:

```json
{
	""private"": true
}
```

install the package (It's not currently available on NPM, you'll have to use the Github repository)

```
npm install --save-dev minecraft-addon-toolchain
```

This will automatically install gulp vNext (4.0.0)

## Create a gulpfile.js gulp configuration

use the following as a template for your gulpfile.js, replacing `<youraddonname>` with the name of your mod, which will be used on the filesystem to identify your mod

```javascript
const MinecraftAddonBuilder = require(""minecraft-addon-toolchain/v1"");

const builder = new MinecraftAddonBuilder(<youraddonname>);
module.exports = modBuilder.configureEverythingForMe();
```

The MinecraftAddonBuilder object can be used to create your own tasks, but the default tasks configured by `configureEverythingForMe()` should be sufficient for simple addons.

Next, update your package.json with appropriate scripts, here are some useful scripts

```json
  ""scripts"": {
    ""build"": ""gulp build"",
    ""installaddon"": ""gulp install"",
    ""rebuild"": ""gulp rebuild"",
    ""watch"": ""gulp watch""
  },
```

-   use **npm run build** to create the directory structure for a .mcaddon
-   use **npm run installaddon** to install the addon into Minecraft for Windows 10
-   use **npm run rebuild** to clean the build directory and rebuild it
-   use **npm run watch** to:
    -   build the project
    -   deploy it to to Minecraft for Windows 10
    -   monitor for changes on the filesystem
        -   automatically rebuilds and deploys the project.

## Conventions

These scripts will assume a certain directory structure by default. These can be overridden by altering properties on the `MinecraftModBuilder` object in your gulpfile.js.

| directory      | purpose                                                                                                                | config property |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| .\packs        | place a directory in here for each pack you have. The type of the pack will be determined by it's `manifest.json` file | sourceDir       |
| .\out\bundled  | the constructed pack directories will be assembled here, ready for deployment into Minecraft                           | bundleDir       |
| .\out\packaged | constructed .mcpack and .mcaddon files will be placed here                                                             | packageDir      |

an example of changing the build directory would look something like this:

```javascript
const MinecraftAddonBuilder = require(""minecraft-addon-toolchain/v1"");

const builder = new MinecraftAddonBuilder(<youraddonname>);
builder.bundleDir = ""./bundle"";
builder.packageDir = ""./package"";
```

## Using plugins

We provide the following plugins.

Because plugins insert themselves into the toolchain, their order is dependent. Refer to their individual read me files for installation and usage.

| NPM package                          | Purpose                                                                                            | Readme                                                                                                                                                              |

Updated to: Minecraft Java Edition 1.14

Json schemas for Minecraft files. Information about json schemas can be found at
[json-schema.org](http://json-schema.org/)

## Design choices

-   The use of the `minecraft:` namespace is mandatory anywhere it can be used.
    This does mean that it will not necessarily validate against all vanilla
    files

## Current progress

At the moment, the following schemas are provided in the `java` folder:

1. Advancements
2. `pack.mcmeta` for both data and resource packs
3. `*.mcmeta` animation files
4. Loot tables
5. `sounds.json`
6. Models
7. Recipes

### Future plans

The following files should be supported in the future

1. Bedrock schemas

973,FalconNL/mc2obj,Haskell,"mc2obj v0.6.5
=============

mc2obj is a tool to convert part of a Minecraft world to a .obj file, which
can be imported into a 3D package such as 3ds max or Blender to make a
rendering of that world.

mc2obj is similar to mcobj (https://github.com/quag/mcobj), with the following
differences:

* It automatically generates texture coordinates and applies textures
* It generates the full geometry, not just blocks
* Support for custom texture packs

Below is an example rendering of a world exported with mc2obj.

[![example export](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LvgUDF3sSZA/TmQDKXXhzFI/AAAAAAAAASU/9VdrdtFhLLE/s640/mc2obj_alpha.jpg ""example export"")](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LvgUDF3sSZA/TmQDKXXhzFI/AAAAAAAAASU/9VdrdtFhLLE/s1600/mc2obj_alpha.jpg)

User manual
-----------

Extract the archive you downloaded somewhere. Open a command line and go to the
mc2obj folder. Type the following (replacing myworld with the name of your save file
and the output folder with whatever you want):

    mc2obj ""%appdata%\.minecraft\saves\world"" -o ""e:\output"" --spawncircle=3 --miny=63

This will output a circle with radius 3, i.e. 7 chunks wide (2 * radius + 1) centered
around the spawn point. The --miny=63 argument means it will only export everything at or
above sealevel (minecraft worlds go from 0 to 127, with 0 being bedrock and 63 being sealevel).
Let's look at some of the other options by exporting part of the Nether:

    mc2obj ""%appdata%\.minecraft\saves\world"" -o ""e:\output"" --rect=-3,-3,3,3 -n -s -b

This will export the rectangle from (-3,-3) to (3,3) of the nether (-n) with sides (-s)
and top and bottom (-b) enabled.

Similarly, you can use --circle and --spawnrect (use mc2obj -? for more information). 
You can also just export the entire world with -e. Note that depending on the size of your world
this may take a long time and result in a very large .obj file. I would recommend using
--miny to keep the filesize down:

    mc2obj ""%appdata%\.minecraft\saves\world"" -o ""e:\output"" -e --miny=63

After exporting, start 3ds max or whatever other 3D package you have and import the .obj
file in the output folder. For 3ds max, use the following settings:

![3ds max import settings](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pm8T_hmlIso/TmQFe9mZsaI/AAAAAAAAASY/Xjeeg0jFtLI/s720/settings.jpg ""3ds max import settings"")

FAQ
---

__I'm running Linux and your program doesn't work__  
I have only tested the release on Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 11.10, but hopefully it should run
on other distributions as well (I'm new at compiling for Linux). Make sure you're using the
correct version (x86 for 32-bit machines, x64 for 64-bit machines). If it doesn't work,
please let me know.

__Is there an OS X version?__  
Not yet. I'm still trying to get OS X working in a virtual machine so I can create a binary.
In the meantime, you can compile the source yourself. See the 'How to compile' section below. 

__How do I run this program/what do I do with these .hs files?__  
If you just want to run the program, make sure you're getting the binary release
(click the big Downloads button in the top right of the Github page) instead of
the source code.

__I've found a bug__  
Please check the Known Bugs section below to see if it's in there.
If not, please let me know so I can fix it. Just add a new issue on
https://github.com/FalconNL/mc2obj/issues (assuming the issue hasn't
been reported before).

__Why is the exporter so slow?__  
Unfortunately, generating the correct geometry takes more time than just generating
cubes like mcobj does. To speed up exporting, you can increase the minY argument to
something like 63 so all the underground caves are skipped. 
Since mc2obj is still in alpha there are probably still some ways to speed up the
program. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. See the FAQ section for
more details.

__I get the message that the chunks are not generated yet__  
mc2obj can only generate chunks that have been generated by Minecraft. Especially
when exporting an area near the edges of your explored terrain or when exporting
the entire world you will frequently get this messsage. If none of the chunks you're
trying to export are generated, you're probably looking in the wrong location.
See the next question for information on determining the correct chunk coordinates,
or use the --spawncircle or --spawnrect options.

__How do I determine which chunk coordinates I should use?__  
While in game, press F3. This will show you a lot of information, among which your
x and z coordinates (in the middle of the screen). Divide both of these by 16 to get
the x and z coordinates for the chunk you're on.

__I imported the model in Blender but I don't see anything__  
Try zooming out, especially if you used the --miny setting. By default the viewpoint
in Blender is too zoomed in to be able to see the world.

__I'm using Blender/Cinema 4D/some other 3D package. How do I import the .obj file?__  
I only use 3ds max, so I'm not familiar with the other packages. The important
setting is to use the z-axis as the up direction. Aside from that, use the normals,
texture coordinates, etc. from the file rather than recalculating them. If you have
other issues, please seek a forum or other help service specific to that package.

__Why are all the textures so blurry in the rendering?__  
Unlike Minecraft, 3ds max (and probably other 3D packages as well) apply texture
filtering by default. This is particularly noticeable when doing closeup renderings.
You can usually turn this off in your renderer. Note that this will cause moire
patterns on overview shots. For 3ds max, the setting can be found at:

* Scanline renderer: Renderer -> Antialiasing -> Filter maps
* V-ray: V-Ray -> Global switches -> Materials -> Filter maps

__What are these purple blocks?__  
They're the 1.8 blocks I haven't implemented yet: iron bars, glass panes and fence
gates. These will be implemented in the next update.

__What render settings should I use?__  
Whatever you want. I'd recommend some type of global illumination but given the
amount of packages, render engines and possible settings I can't go into more detail.
Again, seek the help of someone with more experience with your 3D package/render engine.

__How do I use a custom texture pack?__  
Make sure you have [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php)
installed. Put the required texture files (terrain.png, fire.png, portal.png and sign.png)
in the texsplit folder. Run texsplit.bat (Windows) or texplsit.sh (Linux). The next time
you export a world it will use the new texture pack. Alternatively, replace the tex folder
in your output directory with the one in the texsplit folder and your 3D package should
update the textures immediately.

Known bugs
----------
Major:

* Not all 1.8 blocks have been implemented yet.
* Redstone wire does not display correctly.

Minor:

* Paintings, mine carts, animals and other non-block entities are not exported
* Signs have no text. I have yet to come up with a good way of doing this.
* Chests may not always orient correctly.
* Fence texture coordinates aren't entirely correct
* Some minor player interaction-related geometry effects like pressed pressure
  plates and lit up redstone ore are ignored
* Performance still leaves a lot to be desired. For those interested: according to the
  profiler the two slowest functions are indexString and addFace in ObjExport.hs.
  Suggestions for performance improvement are welcome.

How to compile
--------------
Install the latest version of the [Haskell platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform).
On the command line, execute the following commands (linux users will need to add sudo to all of these):

    cabal update
    cabal install binary-strict
    cabal install cmdargs
    cabal install split
    cabal install utility-ht

Go to the mc2obj folder. Execute the following command:

    ghc mc2obj.hs --make -outputdir=bin -O2 -Wall -fno-warn-missing-signatures -fno-warn-type-defaults

You should now be able to run the program. If not, please let me know."
974,qixils/minecraft-randomiser,GLSL,"# Minecraft Randomiser

This is a set of programs to randomise data about Minecraft.

Requires Python 3.6+ to run. (~~Experimental compiled builds are avaiable from the releases tab.~~ These are extra broken right now, please use Python to run.)

## `resource_randomiser.py`

This randomises every single image, sound, shader, and language file of a resource pack and automatically installs it into your resource pack folder.

This has been tested on Minecraft 1.13.2 & 1.14, and likely works on other versions as well due to its safe way of randomising files.

The regular Minecraft resource pack is included by default. The images, sounds, and other files included in said resource pack are owned and created by Mojang AB and I
take no credit for creating them.

### Usage

To use, simply run `resource_randomiser.py` in python3, or double click the executable file. Options can be viewed from the command line using `resource_randomiser.py -h`

#### Examples

`python3 resource_randomiser.py -h` - Get the program's help and list of options.

`python3 resource_randomiser.py` - Randomises the resource pack from the ""pack"" folder with all default randomisation settings.

`python3 resource_randomiser.py --pack faithful` - Randomises the resource pack from the ""faithful"" folder.

`python3 resource_randomiser.py --notextures --nosounds --pack faithful` - Randomise everything except the textures and sounds from the resource pack in the ""faithful"" folder.

## `data_randomiser.py`

This randomises the Minecraft data pack, which includes files such as loot tables for random block drops, recipes, advancements, and experimentally structures (disabled by default, some configurations crash).

Has only been tested on the 1.14.3 data pack. This may not be fully compatible with custom data packs (especially randomised advancements). Please report any issues you have.

### Usage

`python3 data_randomiser.py -h` - Get the program's help and list of options.

`python3 data_randomiser.py` - Randomises loot tables, recipes, and advancements.

`python3 data_randomiser.py --norecipes --structures` - Enables structure randomisation and disables recipes.

## Bugs

Please report any bugs for either program, especially on Windows and Mac, as they have had little testing. Feature requests are also allowed.

This is Purdue University, built in Minecraft! This project started in March 2019, my second semester here at Purdue. I built the inside and outside of my campus ministry, Launch Campus Ministry, to scale in Minecraft (located at 507 Waldron Street)
Then I built the parking lots surround the building, and then the apartment complex across the street. Then the fraternities and sororities surrounding us. Then I made Ford dining court, and so on and so forth.
Esteban Richey is the main contributor of this project, approximately 65% of the buildings. Andrew, my roommate, contributed approximately 30% of the buildings (including the Corec, Stewart, and many others!) and my fellow campus ministry friend Zach contributed approximately 5% of the buildings, 3 greek house buildings on the north east corner of Waldron.

Here is a picture of the current map of the build (the floor map is located inside Beering!)

980,etil2jz/etil-minecraft-flags,,"## Why [Aikar flags](https://aikar.co/2018/07/02/tuning-the-jvm-g1gc-garbage-collector-flags-for-minecraft/)?
Aikar studied the JVM flags for several weeks before ending with these. The G1 garbage collector offers a great stability with decent performance, but may be slow in certain situations. It helped big servers at that time and it still helps them nowadays, but Java evolved. More and more garbage collectors are being created, and a good alternative today would be ShenandoahGC, tho it drastically increases CPU usage. In a near future, ZGC will be the reference of garbage collectors for Minecraft server, but it is still in development and kills your CPU, for real. That's why I stick to the G1GC.

## Disclaimer
First and foremost, I cannot be held responsible for any problems on your server as a result of these changes. This is still experimental and bugs can happen. No one has the same configuration, everything can vary from person to person.

## Java distribution
I recommend going for [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/), no known memory leaks and vastly used. Right now, use Java 18 as it comes with G1GC improvements over 17.

## Flags
**From 1.18, Java 17 is the minimal requirement. If you're using older versions, I recommend using Java 11. Never ever use Java 8, it's a 7 years old version and has bad performance. Newer released versions are preferred.**

***Supported server softwares:***
- [x] Vanilla
- [x] Spigot/Paper and its multiple forks – *([Mirai](https://github.com/etil2jz/Mirai) is recommended for ultimate performance)*

*of course, adjust -Xms and -Xmx values to whatever you want, same for your java path and server jar*

You shouldn't use more than 20GB of RAM, G1GC could start to struggle…

#### Use WebServer for dynmap :
- You need to change your configuration from class: `org.dynmap.InternalClientUpdateComponent` to class `org.dynmap.JsonFileClientUpdateComponent` *(comment all the section InternalClientUpdateComponent and uncomment JsonFileClientUpdateComponent)*
- Chat will not work when hosted by mcsleepingserverstarter. For a full compatibilty, you can use an apache server *(https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap/wiki/Setting-up-without-the-Internal-Web-Server)*

## 🕸 Bungeecord

While SleepingServerStarter is made to run on a single server, it can be integrated to a Bungeecord network. **But please note that you'll need to install and configure SleepingServerStarter on every servers you want to be affected by the program.**

Installing SleepingServerStarter only on your proxy server <u>**will NOT work**</u>

For each server you're installing SleepingServerStarter on :
- the `serverPort` should be the port of the server you're installing the program on, not the proxy's port
- make sure `serverOnlineMode` is set to `false` to avoid any problems with Bungee when switching between servers

We know this can be a little bit time consuming, but this solution is working great

#### In action :

When trying to join a sleeping server, you get this kind of message by Bungee<br/>
Basically, it keeps kicking the player with `loginMessage` as reason, telling the player the server is being started

This is not the [official carpet version](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) by [gnembon](https://github.com/gnembon),
but an alternative implementation providing a different set of features.

Major features include:
- Commands to measure performance and change the tick speed
- Movable Block Entities
- Auto Crafting Table
- Features to make more items renewable

Almost all features can be configured using `/carpet` and are set to their vanilla value by default.

A list of all configurable rules can be queried with `/carpet list` or seen
[here][rules] for the latest development version

Primarily aimed for use as a standalone mod, but compatibility with other *open source* mods is attempted if feasible.
Report an [issue][new-issue] in that case.

## Installation
- Install Fabric: [Instructions][fabric-wiki-install] 
- Download QuickCarpet:
    - Full releases from [Releases][releases]
    - Development builds from [Actions][actions-dev-builds]
        - Select the build you want to download
            (`master` for the latest stable Minecraft version,other branches for snapshots)
        - When logged in click on `quickcarpet-jars`
        - Extract `quickcarpet-jars` and use the JAR file with the shortest name (without `-dev.jar` or `-sources`)
- Put the `quickcarpet-<version>.jar` into the `mods/` folder

## Compiling
Steps 2 & 3 are optional if you don't want to change the source code

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `gradlew genSources idea` for IntelliJ and `gradlew genSources eclipse` for Eclipse and import the Gradle project
3. Run `gradlew generateJava` and add `build/generated/java` as a source directory (""Generated Sources Root"" in IntelliJ)
4. Run `gradlew build` for creating a build (result in `build/libs/`)

987,joezimjs/Minecraft-Server-Manager-Old,JavaScript,"Minecraft Server Manager (Old)
============================

The old version of a project for starting and sending commands to Minecraft Servers via a web interface. Here's a demonstration:

[![Minecraft Server Manager Demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/dTIv_f-Ll2g/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTIv_f-Ll2g)

This project is no longer maintained as I am working on an entirely new and different version. When it is ready, I will add a link to it here.

## Getting Started
1) git clone the repo to a directory accessible by a normal web server (apache, IIS, etc). You can also use `npx http-server -p 80` from the root directory to start the file server accessible at [http://localhost](http://localhost). You'll also need to start a Node server, though, so before opening it up in your browser, finish the rest of the steps

2) In console, go to /app folder

3) npm install

4) Open `/app/app.js` and edit the CWD (line 37) to point to the folder containing all the folders of your Minecraft Servers

5) Open `/app/servers.js` to configure the servers for the app. Read the comment at the top for more information.

6) You should be able to run the app now. You may start the app server by going to `/app` in your console and running 
`node app`. This isn't technically necessary because if you go the `index.html` from a normal server with PHP enabled 
instead of using `npx http-server` and the app isn't started, there should be a button on the page that will run a PHP
script (`/app/start_node.php`) that will start the Node server for you. If you do this, and it doesn't seem to do anything,
refresh the page a couple times to be sure. If it still doesn't work, start the Node server manually.

If you run into any troubles, just contact me: http://www.joezimjs.com/contact-me/

### The LLVM target for Minecraft you've never wanted

Langcraft is a code generator targeting [Minecraft Data Packs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_Pack). It can currently run a fairly substantial set of bitcode files without issue. The project has a built-in command interpreter for debugging that supports breakpoints (ish) and inspecting register/memory values. All generated datapacks can be run in a real Minecraft Java Edition 1.16+ world in under 5 minutes.

(See also [Wasmcraft2](https://github.com/SuperTails/wasmcraft2) for the spiritual successor to this project, which is faster and more reliable)

### Usage
```
cargo run -- --arg1 --arg2 ./path/to/llvm/bitcode.bc
```
Valid arguments are:
 - `--help`: Display usage and available options
 - `--out=path/to/dir/`: Specify the directory the datapack files should be placed in (default is `./out`)
 - `--run`: Run the command interpreter on the generated code
 - `--trace-bbs`: Insert a print command at the beginning of each LLVM basic block

To use the generated datapack in Minecraft:
 1. Copy the entire output folder (`./out` by default) to the `datapacks/` directory of a Minecraft world (using a superflat void world is recommended)
 2. Run `/function setup:setup`. This only has to be done the first time a Langcraft datapack is used in a world.
 3. Run `/function rust:run`
 4. If the datapack is modified while the world is open, run `/reload` and then go back to step 3.

Rust code must be built as follows:
 - Release mode 
 - `panic=abort`
 - `#![no_std]`
 - `#![no_main]`
 - Have a `main` function with `#[no_mangle]`
 - Use `i686-unknown-linux`

`rust_interp` is a Rust project already configured to generate the proper bitcode. The `interpreter` binary target as shown in the demo can be built with:
```
sh compile_rust.sh
```

And the file to use will be:

`rust_interp/target/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/release/deps/interpreter-SOMEHEXSTRING.bc`

Any other language capable of generating LLVM bitcode can be used, as long as it can be built for a bare-metal 32-bit target. For a clang example see `compile_c.sh`.

Note that the latest nightly versions of rustc now use LLVM 11, which Langcraft cannot parse (yet). You can set an earlier version to use for a directory with:
```
rustup override set nightly-2020-08-23
```

A video of a Langcraft-compiled interpreter can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/Cx0w5Wn9pPU).

[![discord chat](https://img.shields.io/discord/936788458939224094.svg?logo=Discord)](https://discord.gg/C2wX7zduxC)
![supported python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/mcstatus.svg)
[![current PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mcstatus.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/mcstatus/)
[![Validation](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/actions/workflows/validation.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/actions/workflows/validation.yml)
[![Tox test](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/actions/workflows/tox-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/actions/workflows/tox-test.yml)

Mcstatus provides an API and command line script to fetch publicly available data from Minecraft servers. Specifically, mcstatus retrieves data by using these protocols: [Server List Ping](https://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping) and [Query](https://wiki.vg/Query). Because of mcstatus, you do not need to fully understand those protocols and can instead skip straight to retrieving minecraft server data quickly in your own programs.

## Installation

Mcstatus is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mcstatus/), and can be installed trivially with:

```bash
python3 -m pip install mcstatus
```

## Usage

### Python API

#### Java Edition

```python
from mcstatus import JavaServer

# You can pass the same address you'd enter into the address field in minecraft into the 'lookup' function
# If you know the host and port, you may skip this and use JavaServer(""example.org"", 1234)
server = JavaServer.lookup(""example.org:1234"")

# 'status' is supported by all Minecraft servers that are version 1.7 or higher.
# Don't expect the player list to always be complete, because many servers run
# plugins that hide this information or limit the number of players returned or even
# alter this list to contain fake players for purposes of having a custom message here.
status = server.status()
print(f""The server has {status.players.online} player(s) online and replied in {status.latency} ms"")

# 'ping' is supported by all Minecraft servers that are version 1.7 or higher.
# It is included in a 'status' call, but is also exposed separate if you do not require the additional info.
latency = server.ping()
print(f""The server replied in {latency} ms"")

# 'query' has to be enabled in a server's server.properties file!
# It may give more information than a ping, such as a full player list or mod information.
query = server.query()
print(f""The server has the following players online: {', '.join(query.players.names)}"")
```

#### Bedrock Edition

```python
from mcstatus import BedrockServer

# You can pass the same address you'd enter into the address field in minecraft into the 'lookup' function
# If you know the host and port, you may skip this and use BedrockServer(""example.org"", 19132)
server = BedrockServer.lookup(""example.org:19132"")

# 'status' is the only feature that is supported by Bedrock at this time.
# In this case status includes players_online, latency, motd, map, gamemode, and players_max. (ex: status.gamemode)
status = server.status()
print(f""The server has {status.players_online} players online and replied in {status.latency} ms"")
```

### Command Line Interface

This only works with Java servers; Bedrock is not yet supported. Use `mcstatus -h` to see helpful information on how to use this script.

## Description

<details>
  <summary>Open Description</summary>
  
  The Enderite Mod adds new armor and tools, which are successors of Netherite tools.
Enderite ore can be found in the End and needs to be blown up before it can be mined.
You can smelt the ore in a blast furnace to get scraps, which can be craft with diamonds to Enderite Ingots (similar to Netherite).
With these ingots you can craft Enderite tools and blocks, which all have the void floating ability.

### Void floating ability

- no gravity
- they avoid the void (y<0) and float above it, even after a player fell out of the world
- fireproof (like netherite)

### Special items/blocks

- **Enderite Ore**: can only be mined after it was cracked through an explosion (heights 12-48 in the End)
- **Enderite Shulker Box**: safer alternative to normal shulker box (survives the void and is fireproof)
- **Enderite Respawn Anchor**: allows respawns in the End (charged with ender pearls)
- **Enderite Sword**: Can be charged with ender pearls in the smithing table, lets you teleport with sneak + right click if charged
- **Enderite Helmet**: prevents Enderman from getting aggressive towards you when looking at them
- **Enderite Elytra Chestplate**: Enderite Chestplate fused with the Elytra, provides armor and Eyltra flight
- **Enderite Bow/Crossbow**: Are able to shoot Enderman

Sends a [server list ping](http://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping#1.6) packet to Minecraft servers

Usage:

    require('minecraft-ping').ping_fe01fa({host:'localhost', port:25565}, function(err, response) {
      console.log(err, response);
    });

Several pings are supported. Version compatibility:

| Minecraft Version | ping_fe01fa   | ping_fe01     | ping_fe       | Netty status ping(*)
| -------------     | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
| 1.9               | YES           | YES           | Limited       | YES
| 1.8.9             | YES           | YES           | Limited       | YES
| 1.7.10            | YES           | YES           | Limited       | YES
| 1.6.4             | YES           | Slow          | Limited, Slow | NO
| 1.5.2             | YES           | YES           | Limited, Slow | NO
| 1.4.4             | YES           | YES           | Limited, Slow | NO

| earlier           | NO            | maybe         | probably      | NO

(*) As implemented in [node-minecraft-protocol](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol) src/ping.js

(**) Limited = responds but does not return the game/protocol version

Example:

    node demo.js localhost 25565

### ping_fe01fa

`ping_fe01fa` is the best general-purpose ping for most use cases, where a fast response and
reasonable version compatibility is required. It includes `MC|PingHost`,
for efficient 1.6.4 compatibility (but ≤1.3.2 incompatibility). You can use it on old servers
starting with 1.4.4 at the earliest, then 1.5.2 and 1.6.4, and it even works on Netty-based
1.7.10, 1.8.9, and 1.9 servers. The protocol and game version is included in the ping so you
can tell what protocol to speak to it. Example responses from `ping_fe01fa`:

```javascript
{
  pingVersion: 1,
  protocolVersion: 78,
  gameVersion: '1.6.4',
  motd: 'A Minecraft Server',
  playersOnline: 0,
  maxPlayers: 2
}

{
  pingVersion: 1,
  protocolVersion: 61,
  gameVersion: '1.5.2',
  motd: 'A Minecraft Server',
  playersOnline: 0,
  maxPlayers: 2
}

{
  pingVersion: 1,
  protocolVersion: 49,
  gameVersion: '1.4.4',
  motd: 'A Minecraft Server',
  playersOnline: 0,
  maxPlayers: 2
}
```

`ping_fe01fa` does not support 1.3.2 and 1.2.5. If you need to be compatible with older versions,
see `ping_fe01`, `ping_fe`, and/or `ping_fefd_udp`.

`ping_fe01fa` is also exported as `ping`, since it is expected to be the most commonly used ping type.

### ping_fe01

`ping_fe01` is similar to `ping_fe01fa`, but without the `MC|PingHost` channel. The missing
`MC|PingHost` means it will respond slowly on 1.6.4 servers, but this has the advantage of
not confusing 1.3.2 and 1.2.5 servers with the extra data.

However, 1.3.2 and 1.2.5 servers respond only with limited information (no protocol payload,
only server message of the day description, number of online players, and maximum player count).
1.7.10 and above will respond quickly and include the full response, including protocol version.

If you need to support arbitrarily old versions, but do not mind the slow 1.6.4 response (for example,
if you're sending a batch of ping requests over a long period of time), `ping_fe01` may be a good choice.

### ping_fe

`ping_fe` sends nothing more than a single 0xfe byte, and only returns `motd`, `playersOnline`, and
`maxPlayers`. No protocol or game version. However it works even on 1.2.5 and 1.3.2. It will also
work on 1.4.4, 1.5.2, and 1.6.4, but is noticeably slower than `ping_fe01`. On 1.7.10, 1.8.9, and 1.9
it responds quicker, but still lacks the protocol information also returned in `ping_fe01`.

If all you need is the server description, and do not mind the slowness of 1.6.4/1.5.2/1.4.4, consider
`ping_fe`. It is not very useful in most situations, better served by `ping_fe01fa` or `ping_fe01`.


### ping_fefd_udp

`ping_fefd_udp` is a multi-step UDP-based query protocol described in 2011 at
https://dinnerbone.com/blog/2011/10/14/minecraft-19-has-rcon-and-query (for Minecraft 1.9 *beta*).

    require('minecraft-ping').ping_fefd_udp({host:'localhost', port:25565}, function(err, response) {
      console.log(err, response);
    });

Example response from `ping_fefd_udp`:

```javascript
{ worldHeight: 128,
  motd: 'A Minecraft Server',
  gameType: 'SMP',
  gameName: 'MINECRAFT',
  gameVersion: '1.5.2',
  plugins: 'CraftBukkit on Bukkit 1.5.2-R1.1-SNAPSHOT: MultiWorld 4.5.4; SilkSpawners 3.2.2; OpenInv 2.0.2; EnchantMore 2.0; WorldEdit 5.5.6',
  defaultWorld: 'world',
  numPlayers: 0,
  maxPlayers: 20,
  port: 25565,
  host: '0.0.0.0'
}
```

It can be used to query modified servers, such as CraftBukkit, in order to get their installed plugins.
Unlike the fe pings, it does not include the protocol version, though it does include the game version.

On vanilla servers, support can be enabled by setting `enable-query=true` in `server.properties`
(and optionally `query.port`, which defaults to the same as `server-port`). If enabled, the server will log:

```
2016-01-30 11:28:10 [INFO] Starting GS4 status listener
2016-01-30 11:28:11 [INFO] Setting default query port to 25565
2016-01-30 11:28:11 [INFO] Query running on 0.0.0.0:25565
```

where GS4 is apparently the ""GameSpy4"" protocol. Since it is off by default, you'll probably
not need to use `ping_fefd_udp` except in very specialized situations.

### ping_all

`ping_all` sends all of the types of pings, and calls the callback multiple times.
You can get the ping type with the third argument in the callback function.

Note: synchronizing and waiting for each of the pings is currently out of the scope
of this module (see https://github.com/deathcap/node-minecraft-ping/issues/4),
in general it is preferrable to use only one ping type (suggestion: `ping_fe01fa`).
