# Minecraft NLP Project
### Presented by:
- Rae Downen, Cristina Lucin, Michael Mesa and John "Chris" Rosenberger

## Deliverables
* A GitHub Repository ("repo") containing project work
* A Readme file with project description and instructions on how to duplicate project

## Project Description

This project focuses on building a prediction model for accurately predicting the coding language of a project using
examination of GitHub repo README files. Our goal is to develop several predictive models utilizing Python and Python libraries,
and select the most effective model for production. Initially, we are utilizing BeautifulSoup to acquire our data, selecting 500
repositories from the 'Minecraft' topic tag from GitHub, taking in all Readme text and repo language information from each repo. 
After gathering the data, we explore the data through questions, visualizations, and statistical tests before developing a model
that can tell us: "What language is this repository most likely to be written in?"

## Initial Thoughts

Keywords, either singularly or through bigrams and trigrams, will help develop features to effectively model prediction
of Repo programming languages.
