## Project Description

#### This project focuses on building a prediction model for accurately predicting the coding language of a project using examination
#### of GitHub repo README files. Our goal is to develop several predictive models utilizing Python and Python libraries, and select
#### the most effective model for production. Initially, we are utilizing BeautifulSoup to acquire our data, selecting 500 repositories
#### from the 'Minecraft' topic tag from GitHub, taking in all Readme text and repo language information from each repo. After gathering
#### the data, we explore the data through questions, visualizations, and statistical tests before developing a model that can tell us:
#### "What language is this repository most likely to be written in?"
