    "\n",
    "This project focuses on building a prediction model for accurately predicting the coding language of a project using examination of GitHub repo README files. Our goal is to develop a predictive model utilizing Python and Python libraries, and select the most effective model for production. Initially, we are utilizing BeautifulSoup to acquire our data, selecting 1000 repositories tagged with 'Minecraft' from GitHub, taking in all Readme text and repo language information from each repo. After gathering the data, we explore the data through questions and visualizations before developing a model that can tell us: \"What language is this repository most likely to be written in?\""
