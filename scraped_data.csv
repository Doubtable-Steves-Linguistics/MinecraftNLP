**Like this project?**

You might also like my other Minecraft clone written in C using modern OpenGL (GL shader language). It performs better, has better terrain generation and saves state to a sqlite database. See here:

https://github.com/fogleman/Craft

## Goals and Vision

I would like to see this project turn into an educational tool. Kids love Minecraft and Python is a great first language.
This is a good opportunity to get children excited about programming.

The code should become well commented and more easily configurable. It should be easy to make some simple changes
and see the results quickly.

I think it would be great to turn the project into more of a library / API... a Python package that you import and then
use / configure to setup a world and run it. Something along these lines...


```python
import mc

world = mc.World(...)
world.set_block(x, y, z, mc.DIRT)
mc.run(world)
```

The API could contain functionality for the following:

- Easily configurable parameters like gravity, jump velocity, walking speed, etc.
- Hooks for terrain generation.

## How to Run

```shell
pip install pyglet
git clone https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft.git
cd Minecraft
python main.py
```

### Mac

On Mac OS X, you may have an issue with running Pyglet in 64-bit mode. Try running Python in 32-bit mode first:

```shell
arch -i386 python main.py
```

If that doesn't work, set Python to run in 32-bit mode by default:

```shell
defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes 
```

This assumes you are using the OS X default Python.  Works on Lion 10.7 with the default Python 2.7, and may work on other versions too.  Please raise an issue if not.
    
Or try Pyglet 1.2 alpha, which supports 64-bit mode:  

```shell
pip install https://pyglet.googlecode.com/files/pyglet-1.2alpha1.tar.gz 
```

### If you don't have pip or git

For pip:

- Mac or Linux: install with `sudo easy_install pip` (Mac or Linux) - or (Linux) find a package called something like 'python-pip' in your package manager.
- Windows: [install Distribute then Pip](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12476379/992887) using the linked .MSI installers.

For git:

- Mac: install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) first, then `brew install git`.
- Windows or Linux: see [Installing Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) from the _Pro Git_ book.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft/wiki) for this project to install Python, and other tips.

This docker image provides a Minecraft Server that will automatically download the latest stable
version at startup. You can also run/upgrade to any specific version or the
latest snapshot. See the _Versions_ section below for more information.

To simply use the latest stable version, run

    docker run -d -it -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE itzg/minecraft-server

where, in this case, the standard server port 25565, will be exposed on your host machine.

> If you plan on running a server for a longer amount of time it is highly recommended using a management layer such as [Docker Compose](#using-docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](#deployment-templates-and-examples) to allow for incremental reconfiguration and image upgrades.

> Be sure to always include `-e EULA=TRUE` in your commands and container definitions, as Mojang/Microsoft requires EULA acceptance.

By default, the container will download the latest version of the ""vanilla"" [Minecraft: Java Edition server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) provided by Mojang. The [`VERSION`](#versions) and the [`TYPE`](#server-types) can be configured to create many variations of desired Minecraft server. 

## Mitigated Log4jShell Vulnerability

**Please ensure you have pulled the latest image** since [all official mitigations](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition) are automatically applied by the container startup process.

## Looking for a Bedrock Dedicated Server

For Minecraft clients running on consoles, mobile, or native Windows, you'll need to
use this image instead:

[itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server)

## Interacting with the server

[RCON](http://wiki.vg/RCON) is enabled by default, so you can `exec` into the container to
access the Minecraft server console:

```
docker exec -i mc rcon-cli
```

Note: The `-i` is required for interactive use of rcon-cli.

To run a simple, one-shot command, such as stopping a Minecraft server, pass the command as arguments to `rcon-cli`, such as:

```
docker exec mc rcon-cli stop
```

_The `-i` is not needed in this case._

If rcon is disabled you can send commands by passing them as arguments to the packaged `mc-send-to-console` script. For example, a player can be op'ed in the container `mc` with: 

```shell
docker exec mc mc-send-to-console op player
            |                     |
            +- container name     +- Minecraft commands start here
```

In order to attach and interact with the Minecraft server, add `-it` when starting the container, such as

    docker run -d -it -p 25565:25565 --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

With that you can attach and interact at any time using

    docker attach mc

and then Control-p Control-q to **detach**.

For remote access, configure your Docker daemon to use a `tcp` socket (such as `-H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375`)
and attach from another machine:

    docker -H $HOST:2375 attach mc

Unless you're on a home/private LAN, you should [enable TLS access](https://docs.docker.com/articles/https/).

## Data Directory

Everything the container manages is located under the **container's** `/data` path, as shown here:

![](docs/level-vs-world.drawio.png)

> NOTE: The container path `/data` is pre-declared as a volume, so if you do nothing then it will be allocated as an anonymous volume. As such, it is subject to removal when the container is removed. 

### Attaching data directory to host filesystem

In most cases the easiest way to persist and work with the minecraft data files is to use the [volume mounting](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) `-v` argument to map a directory on your host machine to the container's `/data` directory. In the following example, the path `/home/user/minecraft-data` **must be** a directory on your host machine:

    -v /home/user/minecraft-data:/data
       ------------------------- -----
        |                         |
        |                         +-- must always be /data
        |
        +-- replace with a directory on your host machine

When attached in this way you can stop the server, edit the configuration under your attached directory and start the server again to pick up the new configuration.

With Docker Compose, setting up a host attached directory is even easier since relative paths can be configured. For example, with the following `docker-compose.yml` Docker will automatically create/attach the relative directory `minecraft-data` to the container.

```yaml
version: ""3""

services:
  mc:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    ports:
      - 25565:25565
    environment:
      EULA: ""TRUE""
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      # attach a directory relative to the directory containing this compose file
      - ./minecraft-data:/data
```

> NOTE: if you have SELinux enabled, then you might need to add `:Z` to the end of volume mount specifications, [as described here](https://prefetch.net/blog/2017/09/30/using-docker-volumes-on-selinux-enabled-servers/).

### Converting anonymous `/data` volume to named volume

If you had used the commands in the first section, without the `-v` volume attachment, then an anonymous data volume was created by Docker. You can later bring over that content to a named or host attached volume using the following procedure.

> In this example, it is assumed the original container was given a `--name` of ""mc"", so change the container identifier accordingly.

> You can also locate the Docker-managed directory from the `Source` field obtained from `docker inspect <container id or name> -f ""{{json .Mounts}}""`

First, stop the existing container:
```shell
docker stop mc
```

Use a temporary container to copy over the anonymous volume's content into a named volume, ""mc"" in this case:
```shell
docker run --rm --volumes-from mc -v mc:/new alpine cp -avT /data /new
```

Now you can recreate the container with any environment variable changes, etc by attaching the named volume created from the previous step:
```shell
docker run -d -it --name mc-new -v mc:/data -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE -e MEMORY=2G itzg/minecraft-server
```

### Locating filesystem path of anonymous volume

The `Source` field from the output of this command will show where the anonymous volume is mounted from:

```shell
docker inspect -f ""{{json .Mounts}}"" CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
```

> **NOTE** On Windows with WSL the volumes path is `\\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\data\docker\volumes`

## Versions

To use a different Minecraft version, pass the `VERSION` environment variable (case sensitive), which can have the value

- LATEST (the default)
- SNAPSHOT
- or a specific version, such as ""1.7.9""

For example, to use the latest snapshot:

    docker run -d -e VERSION=SNAPSHOT ...

or a specific version:

    docker run -d -e VERSION=1.7.9 ...

When using ""LATEST"" or ""SNAPSHOT"" an upgrade can be performed by simply restarting the container.
During the next startup, if a newer version is available from the respective release channel, then
the new server jar file is downloaded and used. _NOTE: over time you might see older versions of
the server jar remain in the `/data` directory. It is safe to remove those._

## Running Minecraft server on different Java version

> **For Forge versions less than 1.18, you _must_ use the `java8-multiarch` (or other java8) image tag.**

When using the image `itzg/minecraft-server` without a tag, the `latest` image tag is implied from the table below. To use a different version of Java, please use an alternate tag to run your Minecraft server container.

| Tag name          | Java version | Linux  | JVM Type    | Architecture      |
|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| latest            | 17           | Ubuntu | Hotspot     | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java8             | 8            | Alpine | Hotspot     | amd64             |
| java8-jdk         | 8            | Ubuntu | Hotspot+JDK | amd64             |
| java8-multiarch   | 8            | Ubuntu | Hotspot     | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java8-openj9      | 8            | Debian | OpenJ9      | amd64             |
| java8-graalvm-ce  | 8            | Oracle | GraalVM CE  | amd64             |
| java11            | 11           | Ubuntu | Hotspot     | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java11-jdk        | 11           | Ubuntu | Hotspot+JDK | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java11-openj9     | 11           | Debian | OpenJ9      | amd64             |
| java17            | 17           | Ubuntu | Hotspot     | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java17-jdk        | 17           | Ubuntu | Hotspot+JDK | amd64,arm64,armv7 |
| java17-openj9     | 17           | Debian | OpenJ9      | amd64             |
| java17-graalvm-ce | 17           | Oracle | GraalVM CE  | amd64,arm64       |
| java17-alpine     | 17           | Alpine | Hotspot     | amd64             |

For example, to use Java version 8 on any supported architecture:

    docker run --name mc itzg/minecraft-server:java8-multiarch

> Keep in mind that some versions of Minecraft server, such as Forge before 1.17, can't work on the newest versions of Java. Instead, one of the Java 8 images should be used. Also, FORGE doesn't support openj9 JVM implementation.
> 
> Some versions of vanilla Minecraft, such as 1.10, also do not run correctly with Java 17. If in doubt, use `java8-multiarch` for any version less than 1.17.

### Deprecated Image Tags

The following image tags have been deprecated and are no longer receiving updates:
- adopt13
- adopt14
- adopt15
- openj9-nightly
- multiarch-latest
- java16/java16-openj9

## Healthcheck

This image contains [mc-monitor](https://github.com/itzg/mc-monitor) and uses its `status` command to continually check on the container's. That can be observed from the `STATUS` column of `docker ps`

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS                                 NAMES
b418af073764        mc                  ""/start""            43 seconds ago      Up 41 seconds (healthy)   0.0.0.0:25565->25565/tcp, 25575/tcp   mc
```

You can also query the container's health in a script friendly way:

```
> docker container inspect -f ""{{.State.Health.Status}}"" mc
healthy
```

There's actually a wrapper script called `mc-health` that takes care of calling `mc-monitor status` with the correct arguments. If needing to customize the health checks parameters, such as in a compose file, then use something like the following in the service declaration:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: mc-health
  start_period: 1m
  interval: 5s
  retries: 20
```

Some orchestration systems, such as Portainer, don't allow for disabling the default `HEALTHCHECK` declared by this image. In those cases you can approximate the disabling of healthchecks by setting the environment variable `DISABLE_HEALTHCHECK` to `true`.

## Deployment Templates and Examples

### Helm Charts

  - [Helm Chart repo](https://itzg.github.io/minecraft-server-charts/)
- [mcsh/server-deployment](https://github.com/mcserverhosting-net/charts)

### Examples

The [examples directory](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/tree/master/examples) also provides examples of deploying the [itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server/) Docker image.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS) Deployment

If you're looking for a simple way to deploy this to the Amazon Web Services Cloud, check out the [Minecraft Server Deployment (CloudFormation) repository](https://github.com/vatertime/minecraft-spot-pricing). This repository contains a CloudFormation template that will get you up and running in AWS in a matter of minutes. Optionally it uses Spot Pricing so the server is very cheap, and you can easily turn it off when not in use.

### Using Docker Compose

Rather than type the server options below, the port mappings above, etc
every time you want to create new Minecraft server, you can now use
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Start with a
`docker-compose.yml` file like the following:

```yml
version: ""3""

services:
  mc:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    ports:
      - 25565:25565
    environment:
      EULA: ""TRUE""
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    restart: unless-stopped
```

and in the same directory as that file run

    docker-compose up -d

Now, go play...or adjust the `environment` section to configure
this server instance.

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot the container initialization, such as when server files are pre-downloaded, set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `true`. The container logs will include **much more** output, and it is highly recommended including that output when reporting any [issues](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/issues).

To troubleshoot just the command-line used to start the Minecraft server, set the environment variable `DEBUG_EXEC` to `true`.

To troubleshoot any issues with memory allocation reported by the JVM, set the environment variable `DEBUG_MEMORY` to `true`.

## Server types

### Running a Forge Server

Enable [Forge server](http://www.minecraftforge.net/) mode by adding a `-e TYPE=FORGE` to your command-line.

The overall version is specified by `VERSION`, [as described in the section above](#versions) and will run the recommended Forge version by default. You can also choose to run a specific Forge version with `FORGE_VERSION`, such as `-e FORGE_VERSION=14.23.5.2854`.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=FORGE \
        -e VERSION=1.12.2 -e FORGE_VERSION=14.23.5.2854 \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

To use a pre-downloaded Forge installer, place it in the attached `/data` directory and
specify the name of the installer file with `FORGE_INSTALLER`, such as:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e FORGE_INSTALLER=forge-1.11.2-13.20.0.2228-installer.jar ...

To download a Forge installer from a custom location, such as your own file repository, specify
the URL with `FORGE_INSTALLER_URL`, such as:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e FORGE_INSTALLER_URL=http://HOST/forge-1.11.2-13.20.0.2228-installer.jar ...

In both of the cases above, there is no need for the `VERSION` or `FORGEVERSION` variables.

> If an error occurred while installing Forge, it might be possible to resolve by temporarily setting `FORGE_FORCE_REINSTALL` to ""true"". Be sure to remove that variable after successfully starting the server.

### Running a Fabric Server

Enable [Fabric server](https://fabricmc.net/) mode by adding a `-e TYPE=FABRIC` to your command-line.

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
    -e TYPE=FABRIC \
    -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server
```

By default, the container will install the latest [fabric server launcher](https://fabricmc.net/use/server/), using the latest [fabric-loader](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/documentation:fabric_loader) against the minecraft version you have defined with `VERSION` (defaulting to the latest vanilla release of the game).

A specific loader or launcher version other than the latest can be requested using `FABRIC_LOADER_VERSION` and `FABRIC_LAUNCHER_VERSION` respectively, such as:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
    -e TYPE=FABRIC \
    -e FABRIC_LAUNCHER_VERSION=0.10.2 \
    -e FABRIC_LOADER_VERSION=0.13.1
```

> If you wish to use an alternative launcher you can:
> * Provide the path to a custom launcher jar available to the container with `FABRIC_LAUNCHER`, relative to `/data` (such as `-e FABRIC_LAUNCHER=fabric-server-custom.jar`)
> * Provide the URL to a custom launcher jar with `FABRIC_LAUNCHER_URL` (such as `-e FABRIC_LAUNCHER_URL=http://HOST/fabric-server-custom.jar`)

See the [Working with mods and plugins](#working-with-mods-and-plugins) section to set up Fabric mods and configuration.

### Running a Quilt Server

Enable [Quilt server](https://quiltmc.org/) mode by adding a `-e TYPE=QUILT` to your command-line.

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
    -e TYPE=QUILT \
    -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server
```

By default, the container will install the latest [quilt server launcher](https://quiltmc.org/install/server/), using the latest [quilt-installer](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-installer) against the minecraft version you have defined with `VERSION` (defaulting to the latest vanilla release of the game).

A specific loader or installer version other than the latest can be requested using `QUILT_LOADER_VERSION` and `QUILT_INSTALLER_VERSION` respectively, such as:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
    -e TYPE=QUILT \
    -e QUILT_LOADER_VERSION=0.16.0 \
    -e QUILT_INSTALLER_VERSION=0.4.1
```

> If you wish to use an alternative launcher you can: 
> * Provide the path to a custom launcher jar available to the container with `QUILT_LAUNCHER`, relative to `/data` (such as `-e QUILT_LAUNCHER=quilt-server-custom.jar`)
> * Provide the URL to a custom launcher jar with `QUILT_LAUNCHER_URL` (such as `-e QUILT_LAUNCHER_URL=http://HOST/quilt-server-custom.jar`)

See the [Working with mods and plugins](#working-with-mods-and-plugins) section to set up Quilt mods and configuration.

### Running a Bukkit/Spigot server

Enable Bukkit/Spigot server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=BUKKIT` or `-e TYPE=SPIGOT` to your command-line.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=SPIGOT \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If the downloaded server jar is corrupted, set `FORCE_REDOWNLOAD` to ""true"" to force a re-download during next container startup. After successfully re-downloading, you should remove that or set to ""false"".

If you are hosting your own copy of Bukkit/Spigot you can override the download URLs with:

- -e BUKKIT_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>
- -e SPIGOT_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>

You can build spigot from source by adding `-e BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=true`

Plugins can either be managed within the `plugins` subdirectory of the [data directory](#data-directory) or you can also [attach a `/plugins` volume](#optional-plugins-mods-and-config-attach-points). If you add plugins while the container is running, you'll need to restart it to pick those up.

[You can also auto-download plugins using `SPIGET_RESOURCES`.](#auto-downloading-spigotmcbukkitpapermc-plugins-with-spiget)

> NOTE some of the `VERSION` values are not as intuitive as you would think, so make sure to click into the version entry to find the **exact** version needed for the download. For example, ""1.8"" is not sufficient since their download naming expects `1.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT-latest` exactly.

### Running a Paper server

Enable Paper server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=PAPER` to your command-line.

By default, the container will run the latest build of [Paper server](https://papermc.io/downloads) but you can also choose to run a specific build with `-e PAPERBUILD=205`.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
        -e TYPE=PAPER \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If you are hosting your own copy of Paper you can override the download URL with `PAPER_DOWNLOAD_URL=<url>`.

If you have attached a host directory to the `/data` volume, then you can install plugins via the `plugins` subdirectory. You can also [attach a `/plugins` volume](#optional-plugins-mods-and-config-attach-points). If you add plugins while the container is running, you'll need to restart it to pick those up.

[You can also auto-download plugins using `SPIGET_RESOURCES`.](#auto-downloading-spigotmcbukkitpapermc-plugins-with-spiget)

### Running a Pufferfish server

A [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish) server, which is ""a highly optimized Paper fork designed for large servers requiring both maximum performance, stability, and ""enterprise"" features.""

    -e TYPE=PUFFERFISH

### Running a Magma server

A [Magma](https://magmafoundation.org/) server, which is a combination of Forge and PaperMC, can be used with

    -e TYPE=MAGMA

> **NOTE** there are limited base versions supported, so you will also need to  set `VERSION`, such as ""1.12.2"", ""1.16.5"", etc.


### Running a Mohist server

A [Mohist](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist) server can be used with

    -e TYPE=MOHIST

> **NOTE** there are limited base versions supported, so you will also need to  set `VERSION`, such as ""1.12.2""

By default the latest build will be used; however, a specific build number can be selected by setting `MOHIST_BUILD`, such as

    -e VERSION=1.16.5 -e MOHIST_BUILD=374

### Running a Catserver type server

A [Catserver](http://catserver.moe/) type server can be used with

    -e TYPE=CATSERVER

> **NOTE** Catserver only provides a single release stream, so `VERSION` is ignored

### Running a Loliserver type server

A [Loliserver](https://github.com/Loli-Server/LoliServer) type server can be used with

    -e TYPE=LOLISERVER

> **NOTE** Loliserver only provides a single release stream, so `VERSION` is ignored

> **Disclaimer** The retrieval of the serverjar is not bulletproof. It can and probably will change in the future.

### Running a Canyon server

[Canyon](https://github.com/canyonmodded/canyon) is a fork of CraftBukkit for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3. It includes multiple enhancements whilst also retaining compatibility with old Bukkit plugins and mods as much as possible.

    -e VERSION=b1.7.3 -e TYPE=CANYON

> **NOTE** only `VERSION=b1.7.3` is supported. Since that version pre-dates the health check mechanism used by this image, that will need to be disabled by setting `DISABLE_HEALTHCHECK=true`.

By default, the latest build will be used; however, a specific build number can be selected by setting `CANYON_BUILD`, such as

    -e CANYON_BUILD=11

### Running a SpongeVanilla server

Enable SpongeVanilla server mode by adding a `-e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA` to your command-line.
    
By default the container will run the latest `STABLE` version.
If you want to run a specific version, you can add `-e SPONGEVERSION=1.11.2-6.1.0-BETA-19` to your command-line.
    
Beware that current [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org) `STABLE` versions for Minecraft 1.12 require using [the Java 8 tag](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version):
    
    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server:java8-multiarch

You can also choose to use the `EXPERIMENTAL` branch.
Just change it with `SPONGEBRANCH`, such as:

    $ docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data ... \
        -e TYPE=SPONGEVANILLA -e SPONGEBRANCH=EXPERIMENTAL ...

### Running a Limbo server

A [Limbo](https://github.com/LOOHP/Limbo) server can be run by setting `TYPE` to `LIMBO`.

Configuration options with defaults:

- `LIMBO_BUILD`=LATEST

  The `VERSION` will be ignored so locate the appropriate value from [here](https://ci.loohpjames.com/job/Limbo/) to match the version expected by clients.

- `FORCE_REDOWNLOAD`=false
- `LIMBO_SCHEMA_FILENAME`=default.schem
- `LEVEL`=""Default;${LIMBO_SCHEMA


NAME}""

> NOTE: instead of using format codes in the MOTD, Limbo requires [JSON chat content](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_JSON_text_format#Java_Edition). If a plain string is provided, which is the default, then it gets converted into the required JSON structure. 

### Running a Crucible server

A [Crucible](https://github.com/CrucibleMC/Crucible) server can be run by setting `TYPE` to `CRUCIBLE`.

Configuration options with defaults:

- `CRUCIBLE_RELEASE`=latest

Crucible is only available for 1.7.10, so be sure to set `VERSION=1.7.10`.

## Running a server with a Feed the Beast modpack

> **NOTE** requires one of the Ubuntu with Hotspot images listed in [the Java versions section](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version).

[Feed the Beast application](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/) modpacks are supported by using `-e TYPE=FTBA` (**note** the ""A"" at the end of the type). This server type will automatically take care of downloading and installing the modpack and appropriate version of Forge, so the `VERSION` does not need to be specified.

### Environment Variables:
- `FTB_MODPACK_ID`: **required**, the numerical ID of the modpack to install. The ID can be located by [finding the modpack](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpack) and locating the ID in this part of the URL:
  ```
  https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks/23-ftb-infinity-evolved-17
                                          ^^
  ```
- `FTB_MODPACK_VERSION_ID`: optional, the numerical ID of the version to install. If not specified, the latest version will be installed. The ""Version ID"" can be obtained by hovering over a server file entry and grabbing [this ID in the URL](docs/ftba-version-id-popup.png).

### Upgrading

If a specific `FTB_MODPACK_VERSION_ID` was not specified, simply restart the container to pick up the newest modpack version. If using a specific version ID, recreate the container with the new version ID.

### Example

The following example runs the latest version of [FTB Presents Direwolf20 1.12](https://ftb.neptunepowered.org/pack/ftb-presents-direwolf20-1-12/):

```
docker run -d --name mc-ftb -e EULA=TRUE \
  -e TYPE=FTBA -e FTB_MODPACK_ID=31 \
  -p 25565:25565 \
  itzg/minecraft-server:java8-multiarch
```

> Normally you will also add `-v` volume for `/data` since the mods and config are installed there along with world data.

## Running a server with a CurseForge modpack

### Auto CurseForge Management

To manage a CurseForge modpack automatically with upgrade support, pinned or latest version tracking, set `TYPE` to ""AUTO_CURSEFORGE"". The appropriate mod loader (Forge / Fabric) version will be automatically installed as declared by the modpack.

> **NOTE:**
> Be sure to use the appropriate [image tag for the Java version compatible with the modpack](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version).

Use one of the following to specify the modpack to install:

Pass a page URL to the modpack or a specific file with `CF_PAGE_URL` such as the modpack page ""https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-8"" or a specific file ""https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-8/files/4248390"". For example:

```
-e TYPE=AUTO_CURSEFORGE -e CF_PAGE_URL=https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-8
```

Instead of a URL, the modpack slug can be provided as `CF_SLUG`. The slug is the short identifier visible in the URL after ""/modpacks/"", such as

![img.png](docs/cf-slug.png)

For example:
```
-e TYPE=AUTO_CURSEFORGE -e CF_SLUG=all-the-mods-8
```

With either the modpack page or slug approach, the latest file will be located and used. If a specific version is desired, set either `CF_FILE_ID` to the numerical file ID or use a matching substring with `CF_FILENAME_MATCHER`.

The file ID can be located in the URL like

![img.png](docs/cf-file-id.png)

The following two examples both refer to version 1.0.7 of ATM8:

```
-e TYPE=AUTO_CURSEFORGE -e CF_SLUG=all-the-mods-8 -e CF_FILE_ID=4248390
```

```
-e TYPE=AUTO_CURSEFORGE -e CF_SLUG=all-the-mods-8 -e CF_FILENAME_MATCHER=1.0.7
```

### Old approach

Enable this server mode by adding `-e TYPE=CURSEFORGE` to your command-line,
but note the following additional steps needed...

You need to specify a modpack to run, using the `CF_SERVER_MOD` environment
variable. A CurseForge server modpack is available together with its respective
client modpack at <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks> .

Now you can add a `-e CF_SERVER_MOD=name_of_modpack.zip` to your command-line.

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -e TYPE=CURSEFORGE \
        -e CF_SERVER_MOD=SkyFactory_4_Server_4.1.0.zip \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

If you want to keep the pre-download modpacks separate from your data directory,
then you can attach another volume at a path of your choosing and reference that.
The following example uses `/modpacks` as the container path as the pre-download area:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -v /path/to/modpacks:/modpacks \
        -e TYPE=CURSEFORGE \
        -e CF_SERVER_MOD=/modpacks/SkyFactory_4_Server_4.1.0.zip \
        -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

### Modpack data directory

By default, CurseForge modpacks are expanded into the sub-directory `/data/FeedTheBeast` and executed from there. (The default location was chosen for legacy reasons, when Curse and FTB were maintained together.)

The directory can be changed by setting `CF_BASE_DIR`, such as `-e CF_BASE_DIR=/data`.

### Buggy start scripts

Some modpacks have buggy or overly complex start scripts. You can avoid using the bundled start script and use this image's standard server-starting logic by adding `-e USE_MODPACK_START_SCRIPT=false`.

### Fixing ""unable to launch forgemodloader""

If your server's modpack fails to load with an error [like this](https://support.feed-the-beast.com/t/cant-start-crashlanding-server-unable-to-launch-forgemodloader/6028/2):

    unable to launch forgemodloader

then you apply a workaround by adding this to the run invocation:

    -e FTB_LEGACYJAVAFIXER=true

## Running a server with a packwiz modpack

[packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/) is a CLI tool for maintaining and providing modpack definitions, with support for both CurseForge and Modrinth as sources. See the [packwiz tutorial](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/getting-started/) for more information.

To configure server mods using a packwiz modpack, set the `PACKWIZ_URL` environment variable to the location of your `pack.toml` modpack definition:

    docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -e TYPE=FABRIC \
        -e ""PACKWIZ_URL=https://example.com/modpack/pack.toml"" \
        itzg/minecraft-server

packwiz modpack defitions are processed before other mod definitions (`MODPACK`, `MODS`, etc.) to allow for additional processing/overrides you may want to perform (in case of mods not available via Modrinth/CurseForge, or you do not maintain the pack).

> packwiz is pre-configured to only download server mods. If client-side mods are downloaded and cause issues, check your pack.toml configuration, and make sure any client-only mods are not set to `""both""`, but rather `""client""` for the side configuration item.

## Working with mods and plugins

### Optional plugins, mods, and config attach points

There are optional volume paths that can be attached to supply content to be copied into the data area:

`/plugins`
: contents are synchronized into `/data/plugins` for Bukkit related server types. Set `SYNC_SKIP_NEWER_IN_DESTINATION=false` if you want files from `/plugins` to take precedence over newer files in `/data/plugins`.

`/mods`
: contents are synchronized into `/data/mods` for Fabric and Forge related server types. The destination can be changed by setting `COPY_MODS_DEST`.

`/config`
: contents are synchronized into `/data/config` by default, but can be changed with `COPY_CONFIG_DEST`. For example, `-v ./config:/config -e COPY_CONFIG_DEST=/data` will allow you to copy over files like `bukkit.yml` and so on directly into the server directory. Set `SYNC_SKIP_NEWER_IN_DESTINATION=false` if you want files from `/config` to take precedence over newer files in `/data/config`.

By default, the [environment variable processing](#replacing-variables-inside-configs) is performed on synchronized files that match the expected suffixes in `REPLACE_ENV_SUFFIXES` (by default ""yml,yaml,txt,cfg,conf,properties,hjson,json,tml,toml"") and are not excluded by `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDES` and `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDE_PATHS`. This processing can be disabled by setting `REPLACE_ENV_DURING_SYNC` to `false`.

If you want old mods/plugins to be removed before the content is brought over from those attach points, then add `-e REMOVE_OLD_MODS=TRUE`. You can fine tune the removal process by specifying the `REMOVE_OLD_MODS_INCLUDE` and `REMOVE_OLD_MODS_EXCLUDE` variables, which are comma separated lists of file glob patterns. If a directory is excluded, then it and all of its contents are excluded. By default, only jars are removed. 

You can also specify the `REMOVE_OLD_MODS_DEPTH` (default is 16) variable to only delete files up to a certain level.

For example: `-e REMOVE_OLD_MODS=TRUE -e REMOVE_OLD_MODS_INCLUDE=""*.jar"" -e REMOVE_OLD_MODS_DEPTH=1` will remove all old jar files that are directly inside the `plugins/` or `mods/` directory.

These paths work well if you want to have a common set of modules in a separate location, but still have multiple worlds with different server requirements in either persistent volumes or a downloadable archive.

> For more flexibility with mods/plugins preparation, you can declare directories to use in [the `MODS` variable](#downloadable-modplugin-pack-for-forge-fabric-and-bukkit-like-servers)

### Auto-downloading SpigotMC/Bukkit/PaperMC plugins with Spiget

The `SPIGET_RESOURCES` variable can be set with a comma-separated list of SpigotMC resource IDs to automatically download [SpigotMC resources/plugins](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/) using [the spiget API](https://spiget.org/). Resources that are zip files will be expanded into the plugins directory and resources that are simply jar files will be moved there.

> NOTE: the variable is purposely spelled SPIG**E**T with an ""E""

The **resource ID** can be located from the numerical part of the URL after the shortname and a dot. For example, the ID is **9089** from

    https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/
                                                   ====

For example, the following will auto-download the [EssentialsX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/) and [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) plugins:

    -e SPIGET_RESOURCES=9089,34315

### Auto-download mods from Modrinth

[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) is an open source modding platform with a clean, easy to use website for finding [Fabric and Forge mods](https://modrinth.com/mods). At startup, the container will automatically locate and download the newest versions of mod files that correspond to the `TYPE` and `VERSION` in use. Older file versions downloaded previously will automatically be cleaned up.

- **MODRINTH_PROJECTS** : comma separated list of project slugs (short name) or IDs. The project ID can be located in the ""Technical information"" section. The slug is the part of the page URL that follows `/mod/`:
  ```
    https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api
                             ----------
                              |
                              +-- project slug
  ```
- **MODRINTH_DOWNLOAD_OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCIES**=true : required dependencies of the project will _always_ be downloaded and optional dependencies can also be downloaded by setting this to `true`
- **MODRINTH_ALLOWED_VERSION_TYPE**=release : the version type is used to determine the newest version to use from each project. The allowed values are `release`, `beta`, `alpha`.

### Downloadable mod/plugin pack for Forge, Fabric, and Bukkit-like Servers

Like the `WORLD` option above, you can specify the URL or path of a ""mod pack""
to download and install into `mods` for Forge/Fabric or `plugins` for Bukkit/Spigot.
To use this option pass the environment variable `MODPACK`, such as

    docker run -d -e MODPACK=http://www.example.com/mods/modpack.zip ...

**NOTE:** The referenced URL must be a zip file with one or more jar files at the
top level of the zip archive. Make sure the jars are compatible with the
particular `TYPE` of server you are running.

You may also download or copy over individual mods using the `MODS` environment variable. `MODS` contains a comma-separated list of
- URL of a jar file
- container path to a jar file
- container path to a directory containing jar files

  docker run -d -e MODS=https://www.example.com/mods/mod1.jar,/plugins/common,/plugins/special/mod2.jar ...

### ForgeAPI usage to use non-version specific projects

**NOTE:** This potentially could lead to unexpected behavior if the Mod receives an update with unexpected behavior.

This is more complicated because you will be pulling/using the latest mod for the release of your game. To get started make sure you have a [CursedForge API Key](https://docs.curseforge.com/#getting-started). Then use the environmental parameters in your docker build.

Please be aware of the following when using these options for your mods:
* Mod Release types: Release, Beta, and Alpha.
* Mod dependencies: Required and Optional
* Mod family: Fabric, Forge, and Bukkit.

Parameters to use the ForgeAPI:

* `MODS_FORGEAPI_KEY` - Required
* `MODS_FORGEAPI_FILE` - Required or use MODS_FORGEAPI_PROJECTIDS (Overrides MODS_FORGEAPI_PROJECTIDS)
* `MODS_FORGEAPI_PROJECTIDS` - Required or use MODS_FORGEAPI_FILE
* `MODS_FORGEAPI_RELEASES` - Default is release, Options: [Release|Beta|Alpha]
* `MODS_FORGEAPI_DOWNLOAD_DEPENDENCIES` - Default is False, attempts to download required mods (releaseType Release) defined in Forge.
* `MODS_FORGEAPI_IGNORE_GAMETYPE` - Default is False, Allows for filtering mods on family type: FORGE, FABRIC, and BUKKIT. (Does not filter for Vanilla or custom)
* `REMOVE_OLD_FORGEAPI_MODS` - Default is False
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_DEPTH` - Default is 1
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_INCLUDE` - Default is *.jar

Example of expected forge api project ids, releases, and key: 

```yaml
  MODS_FORGEAPI_PROJECTIDS: 306612,256717
  MODS_FORGEAPI_RELEASES: Release
  MODS_FORGEAPI_KEY: $WRX...
```

Example of expected ForgeAPI file format.

**Field Description**: 
* `name` is currently unused, but can be used to document each entry.
* `projectId` id is the id found on the CurseForge website for a particular mod
* `releaseType` Type corresponds to forge's R, B, A icon for each file. Default Release, options are (release|beta|alpha).
* `fileName` is used for version pinning if latest file will not work for you.

```json
[
  {
      ""name"": ""fabric api"",
      ""projectId"": ""306612"",
      ""releaseType"": ""release""
  },
  {
      ""name"": ""fabric voice mod"",
      ""projectId"": ""416089"",
      ""releaseType"": ""beta""
  },
  {
      ""name"": ""Biomes o plenty"",
      ""projectId"": ""220318"",
      ""fileName"": ""BiomesOPlenty-1.18.1-15.0.0.100-universal.jar"",
      ""releaseType"": ""release""
  }
]
```

### Generic pack files

To install all the server content (jars, mods, plugins, configs, etc.) from a zip or tgz file, then set `GENERIC_PACK` to the container path or URL of the archive file. This can also be used to apply a CurseForge modpack that is missing a server start script and/or Forge installer.

If multiple generic packs need to be applied together, set `GENERIC_PACKS` instead, with a comma separated list of archive file paths and/or URLs to files.

To avoid repetition, each entry will be prefixed by the value of `GENERIC_PACKS_PREFIX` and suffixed by the value of `GENERIC_PACKS_SUFFIX`, both of which are optional. For example, the following variables

```
GENERIC_PACKS=configs-v9.0.1,mods-v4.3.6
GENERIC_PACKS_PREFIX=https://cdn.example.org/
GENERIC_PACKS_SUFFIX=.zip
```

would expand to `https://cdn.example.org/configs-v9.0.1.zip,https://cdn.example.org/mods-v4.3.6.zip`.

If applying large generic packs, the update can be time-consuming. To skip the update set `SKIP_GENERIC_PACK_UPDATE_CHECK` to ""true"". Conversely, the generic pack(s) can be forced to be applied by setting `FORCE_GENERIC_PACK_UPDATE` to ""true"".

The most time consuming portion of the generic pack update is generating and comparing the SHA1 checksum. To skip the checksum generation, set `SKIP_GENERIC_PACK_CHECKSUM` to ""true.

### Mod/Plugin URL Listing File 

As an alternative to `MODS`, the variable `MODS_FILE` can be set with the path to a text file listing a mod/plugin URL on each line. For example, the following

     -e MODS_FILE=/extras/mods.txt

would load from a file mounted into the container at `/extras/mods.txt`. That file might look like:

```text
https://edge.forgecdn.net/files/2965/233/Bookshelf-1.15.2-5.6.40.jar
https://edge.forgecdn.net/files/2926/27/ProgressiveBosses-2.1.5-mc1.15.2.jar
# This and next line are ignored
#https://edge.forgecdn.net/files/3248/905/goblintraders-1.3.1-1.15.2.jar
https://edge.forgecdn.net/files/3272/32/jei-1.15.2-6.0.3.16.jar
https://edge.forgecdn.net/files/2871/647/ToastControl-1.15.2-3.0.1.jar
```
> Blank lines and lines that start with a `#` will be ignored

> [This compose file](examples/docker-compose-mods-file.yml) shows another example of using this feature.

> It is recommended to combine this option with `REMOVE_OLD_MODS=TRUE` to ensure the mods/plugins remain consistent with the file's listing.

### Remove old mods/plugins

When the option above is specified (`MODPACK`) you can also instruct script to
delete old mods/plugins prior to installing new ones. This behaviour is desirable
in case you want to upgrade mods/plugins from downloaded zip file.
To use this option pass the environment variable `REMOVE_OLD_MODS=TRUE`, such as

    docker run -d -e REMOVE_OLD_MODS=TRUE -e MODPACK=http://www.example.com/mods/modpack.zip ...

**WARNING:** All content of the `mods` or `plugins` directory will be deleted
before unpacking new content from the MODPACK or MODS.

## Working with world data

### Downloadable world

Instead of mounting the `/data` volume, you can instead specify the URL of a ZIP or compressed TAR file containing an archived world. It will be searched for a file `level.dat` and the containing subdirectory moved to the directory named by `$LEVEL`. This means that most of the archived Minecraft worlds downloadable from the Internet will already be in the correct format.

    docker run -d -e WORLD=http://www.example.com/worlds/MySave.zip ...

**NOTE:** This URL must be accessible from inside the container. Therefore, you should use an IP address or a globally resolvable FQDN, or else the name of a linked container.

**NOTE:** If the archive contains more than one `level.dat`, then the one to select can be picked with `WORLD_INDEX`, which defaults to 1.

### Cloning world from a container path

The `WORLD` option can also be used to reference a directory, zip file, or compressed tar file that will be used as a source to clone or extract the world directory.

For example, the following would initially clone the world's content from `/worlds/basic`. Also notice in the example that you should use a read-only volume attachment to ensure the clone source remains pristine.

```
docker run ... -v $HOME/worlds:/worlds:ro -e WORLD=/worlds/basic
```

The following diagram shows how this option can be used in a compose deployment with a relative directory:

![](docs/world-copy-compose-project.drawio.png)

### Overwrite world on start
The world will only be downloaded or copied if it doesn't exist already. Set `FORCE_WORLD_COPY=TRUE` to force overwrite the world on every server start.

### Custom worlds directory path
To set a custom worlds directory for the Multiverse plugin on a baremetal server, you'd pass the `--world-dir` argument after the jar file.
In order to accomplish the same in a containerized server, set the `EXTRA_ARGS` environment variable in your command line or docker compose yaml to the same argument string. For example:
```
docker run -d -e EXTRA_ARGS='--world-dir ./worlds/'
```
`--world-container`, `-W`, and `--universe` are aliases to `--world-dir` and can also be used.

### Datapacks
Datapacks can be installed in a similar manner to mods/plugins. There are many environment variables which function in the same way they do for [mods](#working-with-mods-and-plugins): 

* `DATAPACKS`: comma-separated list of zip file URL, zip file in container, or directory in container
* `DATAPACKS_FILE`: a text file within the container where each line is a zip file URL, zip file in container, or directory in container
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS`: if ""true"" the datapacks directory is removed of everything matching `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_INCLUDE`, but excluding `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_EXCLUDE` no deeper than `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_DEPTH`
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_DEPTH`: default is 16
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_INCLUDE`: default is `*.zip`
* `REMOVE_OLD_DATAPACKS_EXCLUDE`: default is empty

Datapacks will be placed in `/data/$LEVEL/datapacks`

### VanillaTweaks

[VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resource packs can be installed with a share code from the website **OR** a json file to specify packs to download and install. Datapacks and crafting tweaks will be installed into the current world directory specified by `$LEVEL`. As new versions of the packs are retrieved the previous versions will automatically be cleaned up.

The share code is the part following the hash sign, as shown here:

```
https://vanillatweaks.net/share/#MGr52E
                                 ------
                                  |
                                  +- share code MGr52E
```

Accepted Parameters:

- `VANILLATWEAKS_FILE`: comma separated list of JSON VanillaTweak pack files accessible within the container
- `VANILLATWEAKS_SHARECODE`: comma separated list of share codes

Example of expected VanillaTweaks share codes: 
  **Note**: ResourcePacks, DataPacks, and CraftingTweaks all have separate sharecodes

```yaml
VANILLATWEAKS_SHARECODE: MGr52E,tF1zL2,LnEDwT
```

Example of expected VanillaTweaks files:

```yaml
VANILLATWEAKS_FILE: /config/vt-datapacks.json,/config/vt-craftingtweaks.json,/config/vt-resourcepacks.json
```

Datapacks Json:
```json
{
  ""type"": ""datapacks"",
  ""version"": ""1.18"",
  ""packs"": {
    ""survival"": [
      ""graves"",
      ""multiplayer sleep""
    ],
    ""items"": [""armored elytra""]
  }
}
```

Resourcepacks Json:
```json
{
    ""type"": ""resourcepacks"",
    ""version"": ""1.18"",
    ""packs"": {
        ""aesthetic"": [""CherryPicking"", ""BlackNetherBricks"", ""AlternateBlockDestruction""]
    }
}
```

CraftingTweaks Json:
```json
{
    ""type"": ""craftingtweaks"",
    ""version"": ""1.18"",
    ""packs"": {
        ""quality of life"": [
            ""dropper to dispenser"",
            ""double slabs"",
            ""back to blocks""
        ]
    }
}
```

## Server configuration

By default, the server configuration will be created and set based on the following environment variables, but only the first time the server is started. If the `server.properties` file already exists, the values in them will not be changed.

If you prefer to manually manage the `server.properties` file, set `OVERRIDE_SERVER_PROPERTIES` to ""false"". Similarly, you can entirely skip the startup script's creation of `server.properties` by setting `SKIP_SERVER_PROPERTIES` to ""true"".

> NOTE: to clear a server property, set the variable to an empty string, such as `-e RESOURCE_PACK=""""`. A variables that maps to a server property that is unset, is ignored and the existing `server.property` is left unchanged. 

### Message of the Day

The message of the day, shown below each server entry in the client UI, can be changed with the `MOTD` environment variable, such as

    -e MOTD=""My Server""

If you leave it off, a default is computed from the server type and version, such as

    A Paper Minecraft Server powered by Docker

That way you can easily differentiate between several servers you may have started.

The section symbol (§) and other unicode characters are automatically converted to allow [formatting codes](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes) to be used consistently with all server versions. For example,

     -e MOTD=""A §l§cMinecraft§r §nserver""

renders

![](docs/motd-example.png)

To produce a multi-line MOTD, you will need to double escape the newline such as

    -e MOTD=""Line one\\nLine two""

### Difficulty

The difficulty level (default: `easy`) can be set like:

    docker run -d -e DIFFICULTY=hard ...

Valid values are: `peaceful`, `easy`, `normal`, and `hard`, and an
error message will be output in the logs if it's not one of these
values.

### Whitelist Players

> **NOTE** it is very important to set this with servers exposed to the internet where you want only limited players to join.

To whitelist players for your Minecraft server, you can:
- Provide a list of usernames and/or UUIDs separated by commas via the `WHITELIST` environment variable  
  `docker run -d -e WHITELIST=user1,uuid2 ...`
- Provide the url or path to a whitelist file via `WHITELIST_FILE` environment variable  
  `docker run -d -e WHITELIST_FILE=/extra/whitelist.json ...`

When either is set, [whitelisting of connecting users](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server.properties#white-list) is enabled . If managing the list manually, `ENABLE_WHITELIST` can be set to ""true"" to set the `white-list` property.

If whitelist configuration already exists, `WHITELIST_FILE` will not be retrieved and any usernames in `WHITELIST` are **added** to the whitelist configuration. You can enforce regeneration of the whitelist on each server startup by setting `OVERRIDE_WHITELIST` to ""true"". This will delete the whitelist file before processing whitelist configuration.

> NOTE: You can provide both `WHITELIST_FILE` and `WHITELIST`, which are processed in that order.

> NOTE: UUIDs passed via `WHITELIST` need to be the dashed variant, otherwise it not be recognised and instead added as a username.

> If running Minecraft 1.7.5 or earlier, these variables will apply to `white-list.txt`, with 1.7.6 implementing support for `whitelist.json`. Make sure your `WHITELIST_FILE` is in the appropriate format.

To [enforce the whitelist changes immediately](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server.properties#enforce-whitelist) when whitelist commands are used , set `ENFORCE_WHITELIST` to ""true"".

### Op/Administrator Players

Similar to the whitelist, to add users as operators (aka adminstrators) to your Minecraft server, you can:
- Provide te url or path to an ops file via `OPS_FILE` environment variable  
    `docker run -d -e OPS_FILE=https://config.example.com/extra/ops.json ...`
- Provide a list of usernames and/or UUIDs separated by commas via the `OPS` environment variable  
    `docker run -d -e OPS=user1,uuid2 ...`

If ops configuration already exists, `OPS_FILE` will not be retrieved and any usernames in `OPS` are **added** to the ops configuration. You can enforce regeneration of the ops configuration on each server startup by setting `OVERRIDE_OPS` to ""true"". This will delete the ops file before processing ops configuration.

> Similar to whitelists, you can provide both `OPS_FILE` and `OPS`, and Minecraft 1.7.5 or earlier will use `ops.txt` rather than `ops.json`.

### Enable/disable initial selection of datapacks

New to [22W42A](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-22w42a), datapacks with feature flags can be controlled before initial world creation by setting these to a comma separated list of packs:

- `INITIAL_ENABLED_PACKS`
  such as ""update_1_20,bundle""
- `INITIAL_DISABLED_PACKS`

### Server icon

A server icon can be configured using the `ICON` variable. The image will be automatically
downloaded, scaled, and converted from any other image format:

    docker run -d -e ICON=http://..../some/image.png ...

The server icon which has been set doesn't get overridden by default. It can be changed and overridden by setting `OVERRIDE_ICON` to `TRUE`.

    docker run -d -e ICON=http://..../some/other/image.png -e OVERRIDE_ICON=TRUE...

### RCON

RCON is **enabled by default** to allow for graceful shut down the server and coordination of save state during backups. RCON can be disabled by setting `ENABLE_RCON` to ""false"".

The default password is ""minecraft"" but **change the password before deploying into production** by setting `RCON_PASSWORD`.

**DO NOT MAP THE RCON PORT EXTERNALLY** unless you aware of all the consequences and have set a **secure password** with `RCON_PASSWORD`. 

> Mapping ports (`-p` command line or `ports` in compose) outside the container and docker networking needs to be a purposeful choice. Most production Docker deployments do not need any of the Minecraft ports mapped externally from the server itself.

By default, the server listens for RCON on port 25575 within the container. It can be changed with `RCON_PORT` but only do this if you have a very good reason. **DO NOT change `rcon.port` via `server.properties`** or integrations will break.

### Query

Enabling this will enable the gamespy query protocol.
By default the query port will be `25565` (UDP) but can easily be changed with the `QUERY_PORT` variable.

    docker run -d -e ENABLE_QUERY=true

### Max players

By default max players is 20, you can increase this with the `MAX_PLAYERS` variable.

    docker run -d -e MAX_PLAYERS=50

### Max world size

This sets the maximum possible size in blocks, expressed as a radius, that the world border can obtain.

    docker run -d -e MAX_WORLD_SIZE=10000

### Allow Nether

Allows players to travel to the Nether.

    docker run -d -e ALLOW_NETHER=true

### Announce Player Achievements

Allows server to announce when a player gets an achievement.

    docker run -d -e ANNOUNCE_PLAYER_ACHIEVEMENTS=true

### Enable Command Block

Enables command blocks

     docker run -d -e ENABLE_COMMAND_BLOCK=true

### Force Gamemode

Force players to join in the default game mode.

- false - Players will join in the gamemode they left in.
- true - Players will always join in the default gamemode.

  `docker run -d -e FORCE_GAMEMODE=false`

### Generate Structures

Defines whether structures (such as villages) will be generated.

- false - Structures will not be generated in new chunks.
- true - Structures will be generated in new chunks.

  `docker run -d -e GENERATE_STRUCTURES=true`

### Hardcore

If set to true, players will be set to spectator mode if they die.

    docker run -d -e HARDCORE=false

### Snooper

If set to false, the server will not send data to snoop.minecraft.net server.

    docker run -d -e SNOOPER_ENABLED=false

### Max Build Height

The maximum height in which building is allowed.
Terrain may still naturally generate above a low height limit.

    docker run -d -e MAX_BUILD_HEIGHT=256

### Max Tick Time

The maximum number of milliseconds a single tick may take before the server watchdog stops the server with the message, A single server tick took 60.00 seconds (should be max 0.05); Considering it to be crashed, server will forcibly shutdown. Once this criteria is met, it calls System.exit(1).
Setting this to -1 will disable watchdog entirely

    docker run -d -e MAX_TICK_TIME=60000

### Spawn Animals

Determines if animals will be able to spawn.

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_ANIMALS=true

### Spawn Monsters

Determines if monsters will be spawned.

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_MONSTERS=true

### Spawn NPCs

Determines if villagers will be spawned.

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_NPCS=true

### Set spawn protection

Sets the area that non-ops can not edit (0 to disable)

    docker run -d -e SPAWN_PROTECTION=0

### View Distance

Sets the amount of world data the server sends the client, measured in chunks in each direction of the player (radius, not diameter).
It determines the server-side viewing distance.

    docker run -d -e VIEW_DISTANCE=10

### Level Seed

If you want to create the Minecraft level with a specific seed, use `SEED`, such as

    -e SEED=1785852800490497919

If using a negative value for the seed, make sure to quote the value such as:

    -e SEED=""-1785852800490497919""

### Game Mode

By default, Minecraft servers are configured to run in Survival mode. You can
change the mode using `MODE` where you can either provide the [standard
numerical values](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Game_mode#Game_modes) or the
shortcut values:

- creative
- survival
- adventure
- spectator (only for Minecraft 1.8 or later)

For example:

    docker run -d -e MODE=creative ...

### PVP Mode

By default, servers are created with player-vs-player (PVP) mode enabled. You can disable this with the `PVP`
environment variable set to `false`, such as

    docker run -d -e PVP=false ...

### Level Type and Generator Settings

By default, a standard world is generated with hills, valleys, water, etc. A different level type can
be configured by setting `LEVEL_TYPE` to [an expected type listed here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server.properties#level-type).

For some of the level types, `GENERATOR_SETTINGS` can be used to further customize the world generation [as described here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Server.properties#generator-settings).

### Custom Server Resource Pack

You can set a link to a custom resource pack and set it's checksum using the `RESOURCE_PACK` and `RESOURCE_PACK_SHA1` options respectively, the default is blank:

    docker run -d -e 'RESOURCE_PACK=http://link.com/to/pack.zip?=1' -e 'RESOURCE_PACK_SHA1=d5db29cd03a2ed055086cef9c31c252b4587d6d0'

You can enforce the resource pack on clients by setting `RESOURCE_PACK_ENFORCE` to `TRUE` (default: `FALSE`).

### Level / World Save Name

You can either switch between world saves or run multiple containers with different saves by using the `LEVEL` option,
where the default is ""world"":

    docker run -d -e LEVEL=bonus ...

> **NOTE:** if running multiple containers be sure to either specify a different `-v` host directory for each
`LEVEL` in use or don't use `-v` and the container's filesystem will keep things encapsulated.

> **INFO** Refer to the [data directory](#data-directory) section for a visual description of where the `$LEVEL` directory is situated.

### Online mode

By default, server checks connecting players against Minecraft's account database. If you want to create an offline server or your server is not connected to the internet, you can disable the server to try connecting to minecraft.net to authenticate players with environment variable `ONLINE_MODE`, like this

    docker run -d -e ONLINE_MODE=FALSE ...

### Allow flight

Allows users to use flight on your server while in Survival mode, if they have a mod that provides flight installed.

    -e ALLOW_FLIGHT=TRUE|FALSE

### Server name

The server name (e.g. for bungeecord) can be set like:

    docker run -d -e SERVER_NAME=MyServer ...

### Server port

> **WARNING:** only change this value if you know what you're doing. It is only needed when using host networking and it is rare that host networking should be used. Use `-p` port mappings instead.

If you must, the server port can be set like:

    docker run -d -e SERVER_PORT=25566 ...

**however**, be sure to change your port mapping accordingly and be prepared for some features to break.

### Other server property mappings

## Miscellaneous Options

### Replacing variables inside configs

Sometimes you have mods or plugins that require configuration information that is only available at runtime.
For example if you need to configure a plugin to connect to a database,
you don't want to include this information in your Git repository or Docker image.
Or maybe you have some runtime information like the server name that needs to be set
in your config files after the container starts.

For those cases there is the option to replace defined variables inside your configs
with environment variables defined at container runtime.

When the environment variable `REPLACE_ENV_IN_PLACE` is set to `true` (the default), the startup script will go through all files inside the container's `/data` path and replace variables that match the container's environment variables. Variables can instead (or in addition to) be replaced in files sync'ed from `/plugins`, `/mods`, and `/config` by setting `REPLACE_ENV_DURING_SYNC` to `true` (defaults to `false`). 

Variables that you want to replace need to be declared inside curly brackets and prefixed with a dollar sign, such as  `${CFG_YOUR_VARIABLE}`, which is same as many scripting languages.

You can also change `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX`, which defaults to ""CFG_"", to limit which environment variables are allowed to be used. For example, with ""CFG_"" as the prefix, the variable `${CFG_DB_HOST}` would be subsituted, but not `${DB_HOST}`.

If you want to use a file's content for value, such as when using secrets mounted as files, declare the placeholder named like normal in the file and declare an environment variable named the same but with the suffix `_FILE`. 

For example, a `my.cnf` file could contain:

```
[client]
password = ${CFG_DB_PASSWORD}
```

...a secret declared in the compose file with:
```yaml
secrets:
  db_password:
    external: true
```

...and finally the environment variable would be named with a `_FILE` suffix and point to the mounted secret:
```yaml
    environment:
      CFG_DB_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
```

Variables will be replaced in files with the following extensions:
`.yml`, `.yaml`, `.txt`, `.cfg`, `.conf`, `.properties`.

Specific files can be excluded by listing their name (without path) in the variable `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDES`.

Paths can be excluded by listing them in the variable `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDE_PATHS`. Path
excludes are recursive. Here is an example:
```
REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES_EXCLUDE_PATHS=""/data/plugins/Essentials/userdata /data/plugins/MyPlugin""
```

Here is a full example where we want to replace values inside a `database.yml`.

```yml

---
database:
  host: ${CFG_DB_HOST}
  name: ${CFG_DB_NAME}
  password: ${CFG_DB_PASSWORD}
```

This is how your `docker-compose.yml` file could look like:

```yml
version: ""3.8""
# Other docker-compose examples in /examples

services:
  minecraft:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    ports:
      - ""25565:25565""
    volumes:
      - ""mc:/data""
    environment:
      EULA: ""TRUE""
      ENABLE_RCON: ""true""
      RCON_PASSWORD: ""testing""
      RCON_PORT: 28016
      # enable env variable replacement
      REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES: ""TRUE""
      # define an optional prefix for your env variables you want to replace
      ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX: ""CFG_""
      # and here are the actual variables
      CFG_DB_HOST: ""http://localhost:3306""
      CFG_DB_NAME: ""minecraft""
      CFG_DB_PASSWORD_FILE: ""/run/secrets/db_password""

volumes:
  mc:
  rcon:

secrets:
  db_password:
    file: ./db_password
```

### Patching existing files

JSON path based patches can be applied to one or more existing files by setting the variable `PATCH_DEFINITIONS` to the path of a directory that contains one or more [patch definition json files](https://github.com/itzg/mc-image-helper#patchdefinition) or a [patch set json file](https://github.com/itzg/mc-image-helper#patchset).

Variable placeholders in the patch values can be restricted by setting `REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX`, which defaults to ""CFG_"".

The following example shows a patch-set file were various fields in the `paper.yaml` configuration file can be modified and added:

```json
{
  ""patches"": [
    {
      ""file"": ""/data/paper.yml"",
      ""ops"": [
        {
          ""$set"": {
            ""path"": ""$.verbose"",
            ""value"": true
          }
        },
        {
          ""$set"": {
            ""path"": ""$.settings['velocity-support'].enabled"",
            ""value"": ""${CFG_VELOCITY_ENABLED}"",
            ""value-type"": ""bool""
          }
        },
        {
          ""$put"": {
            ""path"": ""$.settings"",
            ""key"": ""my-test-setting"",
            ""value"": ""testing""
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> **NOTES:** Only JSON and Yaml files can be patched at this time. TOML support is planned to be added next. Removal of comments and other cosmetic changes will occur when patched files are processed.

### Running with a custom server JAR

If you would like to run a custom server JAR, set `-e TYPE=CUSTOM` and pass the custom server
JAR via `CUSTOM_SERVER`. It can either be a URL or a container path to an existing JAR file.

If it is a URL, it will only be downloaded into the `/data` directory if it wasn't already. As
such, if you need to upgrade or re-download the JAR, then you will need to stop the container,
remove the file from the container's `/data` directory, and start again.

### Force re-download of the server file

For VANILLA, FORGE, BUKKIT, SPIGOT, PAPER, CURSEFORGE, SPONGEVANILLA server types, set
`$FORCE_REDOWNLOAD` to some value (e.g. 'true) to force a re-download of the server file for
the particular server type. by adding a `-e FORCE_REDOWNLOAD=true` to your command-line.

For example, with PaperSpigot, it would look something like this:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \
    -e TYPE=PAPER -e FORCE_REDOWNLOAD=true \
    -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server
```

### Running as alternate user/group ID

By default, the container will switch to user ID 1000 and group ID 1000;
however, you can override those values by setting `UID` and/or `GID` as environmental entries, during the `docker run` command.

    -e UID=1234
    -e GID=1234

The container will also skip user switching if the `--user`/`-u` argument
is passed to `docker run`.

### Memory Limit

By default, the image declares an initial and maximum Java memory-heap limit of 1 GB. There are several ways to adjust the memory settings:

- `MEMORY`: ""1G"" by default, can be used to adjust both initial (`Xms`) and max (`Xmx`) memory heap settings of the JVM
- `INIT_MEMORY`: independently sets the initial heap size
- `MAX_MEMORY`: independently sets the max heap size

The values of all three are passed directly to the JVM and support format/units as `<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K]`. For example:

    -e MEMORY=2G

To let the JVM calculate the heap size from the container declared memory limit, unset `MEMORY` with an empty value, such as `-e MEMORY=""""`. By default, the JVM will use 25% of the container memory limit as the heap limit; however, as an example the following would tell the JVM to use 75% of the container limit of 2GB of memory:

     -e MEMORY="""" -e JVM_XX_OPTS=""-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75"" -m 2000M

> The settings above only set the Java **heap** limits. Memory resource requests and limits on the overall container should also account for non-heap memory usage. An extra 25% is [a general best practice](https://dzone.com/articles/best-practices-java-memory-arguments-for-container).

### JVM Options

General JVM options can be passed to the Minecraft Server invocation by passing a `JVM_OPTS`
environment variable. The JVM requires `-XX` options to precede `-X` options, so those can be declared in `JVM_XX_OPTS`. Both variables are space-delimited, raw JVM arguments.

```
docker run ... -e JVM_OPTS=""-someJVMOption someJVMOptionValue"" ...
```

**NOTE** When declaring `JVM_OPTS` in a compose file's `environment` section with list syntax, **do not** include the quotes:

```yaml
    environment:
      - EULA=true
      - JVM_OPTS=-someJVMOption someJVMOptionValue 
```

Using object syntax is recommended and more intuitive:

```yaml
    environment:
      EULA: ""true""
      JVM_OPTS: ""-someJVMOption someJVMOptionValue""
# or
#     JVM_OPTS: -someJVMOption someJVMOptionValue
```

As a shorthand for passing several system properties as `-D` arguments, you can instead pass a comma separated list of `name=value` or `name:value` pairs with `JVM_DD_OPTS`. (The colon syntax is provided for management platforms like Plesk that don't allow `=` inside a value.)

For example, instead of passing

```yaml
  JVM_OPTS: -Dfml.queryResult=confirm -Dname=value
```

you can use

```yaml
  JVM_DD_OPTS: fml.queryResult=confirm,name=value
```

### Extra Arguments

Arguments that would usually be passed to the jar file (those which are written after the filename) can be passed via the `EXTRA_ARGS` environment variable.

See [Custom worlds directory path](#custom-worlds-directory-path) for an example.

### Interactive and Color Console

If you would like to `docker attach` to the Minecraft server console with color and interactive capabilities, then add

```
  -e EXEC_DIRECTLY=true
```

> **NOTES**
>
> This feature doesn't work via rcon, so you will need to `docker attach` to the container. Use the sequence Ctrl-P, Ctrl-Q to detach. 
> 
> This will bypass graceful server shutdown handling when using `docker stop`, so be sure the server console's `stop` command.
> 
> Make to enable stdin and tty with `-it` when using `docker run` or `stdin_open: true` and `tty: true` when using docker compose.
>
> This feature is incompatible with Autopause and cannot be set when `ENABLE_AUTOPAUSE=true`.

### Server Shutdown Options

To allow time for players to finish what they're doing during a graceful server shutdown, set `STOP_SERVER_ANNOUNCE_DELAY` to a number of seconds to delay after an announcement is posted by the server.

> **NOTE** be sure to adjust Docker's shutdown timeout accordingly, such as using [the -t option on docker-compose down](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/down/).

### OpenJ9 Specific Options

The openj9 image tags include specific variables to simplify configuration:

- `-e TUNE_VIRTUALIZED=TRUE` : enables the option to
  [optimize for virtualized environments](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/xtunevirtualized/)
- `-e TUNE_NURSERY_SIZES=TRUE` : configures nursery sizes where the initial size is 50%
  of the `MAX_MEMORY` and the max size is 80%.

### Enabling rolling logs

By default the vanilla log file will grow without limit. The logger can be reconfigured to use a rolling log files strategy by using:

```
  -e ENABLE_ROLLING_LOGS=true
```

> **NOTE** this will interfere with interactive/color consoles [as described in the section above](#interactive-and-color-console)

### Timezone Configuration

You can configure the timezone to match yours by setting the `TZ` environment variable:

        -e TZ=Europe/London

such as:

        docker run -d -it -e TZ=Europe/London -p 25565:25565 --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

Or mounting `/etc/timezone` as readonly (not supported on Windows):

        -v /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro

such as:

        docker run -d -it -v /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro -p 25565:25565 --name mc itzg/minecraft-server

### Enable Remote JMX for Profiling

To enable remote JMX, such as for profiling with VisualVM or JMC, add the environment variable `ENABLE_JMX=true`, set `JMX_HOST` to the IP/host running the Docker container, and add a port forwarding of TCP port 7091, such as:

```
-e ENABLE_JMX=true -e JMX_HOST=$HOSTNAME -p 7091:7091
```

### Enable Aikar's Flags

[Aikar has done some research](https://aikar.co/2018/07/02/tuning-the-jvm-g1gc-garbage-collector-flags-for-minecraft/) into finding the optimal JVM flags for GC tuning, which becomes more important as more users are connected concurrently. The set of flags documented there can be added using

    -e USE_AIKAR_FLAGS=true

When `MEMORY` is greater than or equal to 12G, then the Aikar flags will be adjusted according to the article.

### HTTP Proxy

You may configure the use of an HTTP/HTTPS proxy by passing the proxy's URL via the `PROXY`
environment variable. In [the example compose file](examples/docker-compose-proxied.yml) it references
a companion squid proxy by setting the equivalent of

    -e PROXY=proxy:3128

### Using ""noconsole"" option

Some older versions (pre-1.14) of Spigot required `--noconsole` to be passed when detaching stdin, which can be done by setting `-e CONSOLE=FALSE`.

### Explicitly disable GUI

Some older servers get confused and think that the GUI interface is enabled. You can explicitly
disable that by passing `-e GUI=FALSE`.

### Stop Duration

When the container is signalled to stop, the Minecraft process wrapper will attempt to send a ""stop"" command via RCON or console and waits for the process to gracefully finish. By default it waits 60 seconds, but that duration can be configured by setting the environment variable `STOP_DURATION` to the number of seconds.

### Setup only

If you are using a host-attached data directory, then you can have the image setup the Minecraft server files and stop prior to launching the server process by setting `SETUP_ONLY` to `true`. 
    
### Enable Flare Flags
    
To enable the JVM flags required to fully support the [Flare profiling suite](https://blog.airplane.gg/flare), set the following variable:
    
    -e USE_FLARE_FLAGS=true
    
Flare is built-in to Pufferfish/Purpur, and is available in [plugin form](https://github.com/TECHNOVE/FlarePlugin) for other server types.

### Enable support for optimized SIMD operations

To enable support for optimized SIMD operations, the JVM flag can be set with the following variable:

    -e USE_SIMD_FLAGS=true

SIMD optimized operations are supported by Pufferfish and Purpur.

### Enable timestamps in init logs

Before the container starts the Minecraft Server its output is prefixed with `[init]`, such as

```
[init] Starting the Minecraft server...
```

To also include the timestamp with each log, set `LOG_TIMESTAMP` to ""true"". The log output will then look like:

```
[init] 2022-02-05 16:58:33+00:00 Starting the Minecraft server...
```

### Auto-execute RCON commands

RCON commands can be configured to execute when the server starts, a client connects, or a client disconnects.

> When declaring several commands within a compose file environment variable, it's easiest to use YAML's `|-` [block style indicator](https://yaml-multiline.info/).

**On Server Start:**

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_STARTUP:  |-
        gamerule doFireTick false
        pregen start 200
```

**On Client Connection:**

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_ON_CONNECT:  |-
        team join New @a[team=]
```

**Note:**
* On client connect we only know there was a connection, and not who connected. RCON commands will need to be used for that.

**On Client Disconnect:**

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_ON_DISCONNECT:  |-
        gamerule doFireTick true
```

**On First Client Connect**

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_FIRST_CONNECT: |-
        pregen stop
```

**On Last Client Disconnect**

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_LAST_DISCONNECT: |-
        kill @e[type=minecraft:boat]
        pregen start 200

```

**Example of rules for new players**

Uses team NEW and team OLD to track players on the server. So move player with no team to NEW, run a command, move them to team OLD.
[Reference Article](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/redstone-discussion-and/2213523-detect-players-first-join)

```yaml
      RCON_CMDS_STARTUP:  |-
        /pregen start 200
        /gamerule doFireTick false
        /team add New
        /team add Old
      RCON_CMDS_ON_CONNECT: |-
        /team join New @a[team=]
        /give @a[team=New] birch_boat
        /team join Old @a[team=New]
      RCON_CMDS_FIRST_CONNECT: |-
        /pregen stop
      RCON_CMDS_LAST_DISCONNECT: |-
        /kill @e[type=minecraft:boat]
        /pregen start 200
```

## Autopause

### Description

There are various bug reports on [Mojang](https://bugs.mojang.com) about high CPU usage of servers with newer versions, even with few or no clients connected (e.g. [this one](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149018), in fact the functionality is based on [this comment in the thread](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149018?focusedCommentId=593606&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-593606)).

An autopause functionality has been added to this image to monitor whether clients are connected to the server. If for a specified time no client is connected, the Java process is stopped. When knocking on the server port (e.g. by the ingame Multiplayer server overview), the process is resumed. The experience for the client does not change.

Of course, even loaded chunks are not ticked when the process is stopped.

**You must greatly increase or disable max-tick-time watchdog functionality.** From the server's point of view, the pausing causes a single tick to take as long as the process is stopped, so the server watchdog might intervene after the process is continued, possibly forcing a container restart. To prevent this, ensure that the `max-tick-time` in the `server.properties` file is set to a very large value or -1 to disable it entirely, which is highly recommended. That can be set with `MAX_TICK_TIME` as described in [the section below](#max-tick-time).

> **NOTE:** Non-vanilla versions might have their own configuration file, you might have to disable their watchdogs separately. For PaperMC servers, you need to send the JVM flag `-Ddisable.watchdog=true`, this can be done with the docker env variable `-e JVM_DD_OPTS=disable.watchdog:true`

On startup the `server.properties` file is checked and, if applicable, a warning is printed to the terminal. When the server is created (no data available in the persistent directory), the properties file is created with the Watchdog disabled.

The utility used to wake the server (`knock(d)`) works at network interface level. So the correct interface has to be set using the `AUTOPAUSE_KNOCK_INTERFACE` variable when using non-default networking environments (e.g. host-networking, Portainer oder NAS solutions). See the description of the variable below.

A file called `.paused` is created in `/data` directory when the server is paused and removed when the server is resumed. Other services may check for this file's existence before waking the server.

A starting, example compose file has been provided in [examples/docker-compose-autopause.yml](examples/docker-compose-autopause.yml).

### Enabling Autopause

Enable the Autopause functionality by setting:

```
-e ENABLE_AUTOPAUSE=TRUE
```

Autopause is not compatible with `EXEC_DIRECTLY=true` and the two cannot be set together.

> When configuring kubernetes readiness/liveness health checks with auto-pause enabled, be sure to reference the `mc-health` wrapper script rather than `mc-status` directly.

The following environment variables define the behaviour of auto-pausing:
* `AUTOPAUSE_TIMEOUT_EST`, default `3600` (seconds)
  describes the time between the last client disconnect and the pausing of the process (read as timeout established)
* `AUTOPAUSE_TIMEOUT_INIT`, default `600` (seconds)
  describes the time between server start and the pausing of the process, when no client connects inbetween (read as timeout initialized)
* `AUTOPAUSE_TIMEOUT_KN`, default `120` (seconds)
  describes the time between knocking of the port (e.g. by the main menu ping) and the pausing of the process, when no client connects inbetween (read as timeout knocked)
* `AUTOPAUSE_PERIOD`, default `10` (seconds)
  describes period of the daemonized state machine, that handles the pausing of the process (resuming is done independently)
* `AUTOPAUSE_KNOCK_INTERFACE`, default `eth0`
  <br>Describes the interface passed to the `knockd` daemon. If the default interface does not work, run the `ifconfig` command inside the container and derive the interface receiving the incoming connection from its output. The passed interface must exist inside the container. Using the loopback interface (`lo`) does likely not yield the desired results.

> To troubleshoot, add `DEBUG_AUTOPAUSE=true` to see additional output

## Autostop

An option to stop the server after a specified time has been added for niche applications (e.g. billing saving on AWS Fargate). The function is incompatible with the Autopause functionality, as they basically cancel out each other.

Note that the docker container variables have to be set accordingly (restart policy set to ""no"") and that the container has to be manually restarted.

A starting, example compose file has been provided in [examples/docker-compose-autostop.yml](examples/docker-compose-autostop.yml).

Enable the Autostop functionality by setting:

```
-e ENABLE_AUTOSTOP=TRUE
```

The following environment variables define the behaviour of auto-stopping:
* `AUTOSTOP_TIMEOUT_EST`, default `3600` (seconds)
  describes the time between the last client disconnect and the stopping of the server (read as timeout established)
* `AUTOSTOP_TIMEOUT_INIT`, default `1800` (seconds)
  describes the time between server start and the stopping of the server, when no client connects inbetween (read as timeout initialized)
* `AUTOSTOP_PERIOD`, default `10` (seconds)
  describes period of the daemonized state machine, that handles the stopping of the server

> To troubleshoot, add `DEBUG_AUTOSTOP=true` to see additional output

## Running on RaspberryPi

To run this image on a RaspberryPi 3 B+, 4, or newer, use any of the image tags [list in the Java version section](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version) that specify `armv7` for the architecture, which includes `itzg/minecraft-server:latest`.

> NOTE: you may need to lower the memory allocation, such as `-e MEMORY=750m`

> If experiencing issues such as ""sleep: cannot read realtime clock: Operation not permitted"", ensure `libseccomp` is up to date on your host. In some cases adding `:Z` flag to the `/data` mount may be needed, [but use cautiously](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-the-selinux-label).

Minecraft Overviewer  |Build Status|
====================================
By Andrew Brown and contributors (see CONTRIBUTORS.rst).

Documentation:
    http://docs.overviewer.org

Github code repository:
    https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer

Travis-CI:

The Minecraft Overviewer is a command-line tool for rendering high-resolution
maps of Minecraft worlds. It generates a set of static html and image files and
uses Leaflet to display a nice interactive map.

The Overviewer has been in active development for several years and has many
features, including day and night lighting, cave rendering, mineral overlays,
and many plugins for even more features! It is written mostly in Python with
critical sections in C as an extension module.

Getting Started
---------------
All documentation has been consolidated at our documentation site. For
information on downloading, compiling, installing, and running The Overviewer,
visit the docs site.

http://docs.overviewer.org

A few helpful tips are below, but everyone is going to want to visit the
documentation site for the most up-to-date and complete set of instructions!

Alternatively, the docs are also in the docs/ directory of the source download.
Look in there if you can't access the docs site.

Examples
--------
See examples of The Overviewer in action!

https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer/wiki/Map-examples

Disclaimers
-----------
Before you dive into using this, just be aware that, for large maps, there is a
*lot* of data to parse through and process. If your world is very large, expect
the initial render to take at least an hour, possibly more. (Since Minecraft
maps are practically infinite, the maximum time this could take is also
infinite!)

If you press ctrl-C, it will stop. The next run will pick up where it left off.

Once your initial render is done, subsequent renderings will be MUCH faster due
to all the caching that happens behind the scenes. Just use the same output
directory and it will only update the tiles it needs to.

There are probably some other minor glitches along the way, hopefully they will
be fixed soon. See the `Bugs`_ section below.

Viewing the Results
-------------------
Within the output directory you will find two things: an index.html file, and a
directory hierarchy full of images. To view your world, simply open index.html
in a web browser.

You can throw these files up to a web server to let others view your map.

Bedrock and other formats
=========================

Minecraft Overviewer only supports the world format from the Java edition of Minecraft.
Minecraft Bedrock (the Windows 10 version) is not supported by Overviewer, but users
have reported success using `Amulet <https://www.amuletmc.com/>`__ to convert
Bedrock worlds to the Java format, and then used Overviewer to render the converted
worlds.

4,TheGreyGhost/MinecraftByExample,Java,"MinecraftByExample [1.16.4]
==================
The purpose of MinecraftByExample is to give simple working examples of the important concepts in Minecraft and Forge. If you're anything like me, a good code example is worth several screens of waffling explanation, and can very quickly explain the key concepts.  I also find it much easier to adapt and debug something that already works, than to have to synthesize something from scratch and spend hours trying to discover the missing bit of information I didn't know about.

I've tried to keep the code simple and obvious and to resist the urge to be clever. The examples might not be the most efficient or succinct implementation, I've deliberately left the optimization to you.

Each example is split up to be totally independent of all the others.  The only part of the code which is common to more than one example is the MinecraftByExample class.

If you want more information and explanatory text about the concepts, the following links might be useful:

  - [The Official Forge documentation][forgedocs] (parts of it are rather outdated but on the whole still very useful starting reference)
  - [Guide to how Minecraft works][greyminecraftcoder] (explaining the key concepts for understanding vanilla code)
  - [Fabric Wiki][fabricwiki] (some of it is specific to the Fabric API, but a lot of useful general info too) 
  - [Forge modder support forum][Forge forum] ask for advice from the experts
  - [McJty tutorials][McJty] lots of step-by-step instructions / tutorial
  - [Mr Crayfish Furniture Mod (lots of examples)](https://github.com/MrCrayfish/MrCrayfishFurnitureMod)
  - [Cadiboo's example mod](https://github.com/Cadiboo/Example-Mod) some great tutorials for when you're starting out
  
#### For earlier versions, see the relevant GitHub branch:
 - MBE for Forge 1.8: [1-8final][version1-8]
 - MBE for Forge 1.8.9: [1-8-9final][version1-8-9]
 - MBE for Forge 1.10.2: [1-10-2final][version1-10-2]
 - MBE for Forge 1.11: [1-11final][version1-11]
 - MBE for Forge 1.11.2: [1-11-2final][version1-11-2]
 - MBE for Forge 1.12.2: [1-12-2final][version1-12-2]
 - MBE for Forge 1.14.4: [1-14-4partial][version1-14-4] (partially updated only)
 - MBE for Forge 1.15.2: [1-15-2][version1-15-2] 
 - MBE for Forge 1.16.3: [1-16-3][version1-16-3]

If you are updating from previous forge versions, you will probably find [this link][versionupdates] and [this link][versionupdates1-15] very helpful.  For better or for worse, MCP decided to rename a very large number of classes (eg all Blocks Blockxxx --> xxxxBlock, etc) so this might save you a stack of time.
If you use IntelliJ, you might find these [xml mapping files][mapfiles] useful too

## List of examples

### Miscellaneous Debugging Tools
  - [DebuggingTools]- This package is a bunch of functions and tools that I use occasionally, mostly for debugging
  
## Usage
  - You can browse directly in GitHub, or alternatively, download it as a zip and browse it locally.

  - If you want to install it and compile it, the basic steps for beginners are:
    1. Download the project as a zip.
    2. Unzip it to an appropriate folder on your computer, such as My Documents.  (Or, if you know how to fork a project on GitHub and import it into a local git repository, you can do that instead)
    3. Look at Forge's README.txt file in this folder and follow the instructions to import it into Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
    4. Use the gradle task runClient to run or debug the project.

### How to compile and run:
1) Execute gradle task runClient to test the client installation
or
2) Execute gradle task runServer to test the dedicated server installation.  (The first time you run this task it will exit without starting the server.  You then need to edit the eula.txt file in the run directory, and execute runServer again.)

Info and Documentation [![Current Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-1.5.21-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327)
----------------------

<a href=""https://discord.gg/j6UNcfr""><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/JXu9C1G.png"" height=""48px""></img></a>

Visit [https://minecraftdev.org](https://minecraftdev.org) for some information about the project.


Installation
------------

This plugin is available on the [JetBrains IntelliJ plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327).

Because of this, you can install the plugin through IntelliJ's internal plugin browser. Navigate to
`File -> Settings -> Plugins` and click the `Browse Repositories...` button at the bottom of the window. In the search
box, simply search for `Minecraft`. You can install it from there and restart IntelliJ to activate the plugin.

Building
--------

Build the plugin with:

`./gradlew build`

The output .zip file for the plugin will be in `build/distributions`.

Test the plugin in IntelliJ with:

`./gradlew runIde`

Code is generated during the build task, to run the generation task without building use:

`./gradlew generate`

This task is necessary to work on the code without errors before the initial build.

To format the code in this project:

`./gradlew format`

This will format using `ktlint` described below in the [style guide](#style-guide) section below.

The [Gradle IntelliJ Plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin)
will handle downloading the IntelliJ dependencies and packaging the
plugin.

Style Guide
-----------

This projects follows the opinionated [`ktlint`](https://ktlint.github.io/) linter and formatter. It uses the
[`ktlint-gradle`](https://github.com/jlleitschuh/ktlint-gradle) plugin to automatically check and format the code in
this repo.

IDE Setup
---------

It's recommended to run the `ktlintApplyToIdea` and `addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook` tasks to configure your
IDE with `ktlint` style settings and to automatically format this project's code before committing:

```
./gradlew ktlintApplyToIdea addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook
```

IntelliJ includes a lot of dependencies transitively, including common dependencies that are used a lot, such as Kotlin,
Commons Lang3, Guava, etc. Unfortunately, the source distribution for IntelliJ does not contain sources for libraries as
well, so these libraries are imported into the IDE without sources by default. If you want to attach sources for (most)
of the dependencies IntelliJ includes, run the `resolveIntellijLibSources` task and refresh the Gradle project in
IntelliJ:

```
./gradlew resolveIntellijLibSources
```

If you're curious about that task, it is implemented in `buildSrc`.

6,jdah/minecraft-weekend,C,"# Minecraft, but I made it in 48 hours*

\* I've actually updated it since - [see this commit for the 48 hour version](https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend/tree/cb19738305804b5734faa7118c1c784f26ff9463).

![screenshot](screenshots/1.png)

#### Features:
- Infinite, procedurally generated world
- Infinite height/depth
- Day/night cycle
- Biomes
- ECS-driven player and entities with full collision and movement
- Full RGB lighting
- Full transparency + translucency support
- Sprite blocks (flowers)
- Animated blocks (water + lava)
- Distance fog
- A whole lot of different block types
- More

#### Building

##### Unix-like
`$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend.git`\
`$ make`

The following static libraries under `lib/` must be built before the main project can be built:

- GLAD `lib/glad/src/glad.o`
- CGLM `lib/cglm/.libs/libcglm.a`
- GLFW `lib/glfw/src/libglfw3.a`
- libnoise `lib/noise/libnoise.a`

All of the above have their own Makefile under their respective subdirectory and can be built with `$ make libs`.
If libraries are not found, ensure that submodules have been cloned.

The game binary, once built with `$ make`, can be found in `./bin/`.

*Be sure* to run with `$ ./bin/game` out of the root directory of the repository.
If you are getting ""cannot open file"" errors (such as ""cannot find ./res/shaders/*.vs""), this is the issue. 

##### Windows

good luck 🤷‍♂️ probably try building under WSL and using an X environment to pass graphics through.

<h2>Installation Guide</h2>
<a href=""https://jamesachambers.com/minecraft-bedrock-edition-ubuntu-dedicated-server-guide/"">Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server Script Installation / Configuration Guide</a>

<h2>Installing Resource Packs / RTX Support</h2>
<p>For instructions on how to install resource packs (including optional RTX support), view my <a href=""https://jamesachambers.com/minecraft-bedrock-server-resource-pack-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">step-by-step Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server Resource Packs / Optional RTX guide here</a>.</p>

<h2>Tested Distributions</h2>

</ul>
  
<h2>Tested Platforms</h2>
<ul>
 <li>All PC X86_64 (WORKING)</li>
 <li><a href=""https://jamesachambers.com/udoo-x86-microboard-breakdown/"">Udoo X86 (WORKING)</a></li>
 <li><a href=""https://jamesachambers.com/install-ubuntu-server-18-04-on-intel-compute-stick-guide/"">Intel Compute Stick (WORKING)</a></li>

    <ul>
      <li>Raspberry Pi 64 bit (WORKING -- Box64)</li>
      <li>Raspberry Pi 32 bit (WORKING -- VERY SLOW -- 64 bit recommended!)</li>
      <li>Tinkerboard (WORKING, 32 bit is slow, 64 bit uses Box64)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Multiple Servers and Installation Paths</h2>
<p>The server supports multiple servers at once.  When you run SetupMinecraft.sh again, pick the identical root path as any previous servers.  The path structure of the scripts is $ROOTPATH/minecraftbe/yourservername, which is why the ""root"" path SetupMinecraft.sh asks you for should always be the same.</p>
<p>The individual server folder is determined by the ""server name"" you enter for your server.  If it's an existing server, the scripts will be safely updated.  If it's a new server, then a new folder will be created under $ROOTPATH/minecraftbe/newservername.</p>
<p>Keep the installation path the same for all servers and the script will manage all this for you.</p>

<h2>Version Override</h2>
You can revert to a previous version with the revert.sh script included in your directory like this: <pre>./revert.sh
Set previous version in version_pin.txt: bedrock-server-1.19.10.20.zip</pre>
If you have a specific version you would like to run, you can also create version_pin.txt yourself like this: <pre>echo ""bedrock-server-1.18.33.02.zip"" > version_pin.txt</pre>
The version hold can be removed by deleting version_pin.txt.  This will allow it to update to the latest version again!

<h2>Troubleshooting Note - Oracle Virtual Machines</h2>
A very common problem people have with the Oracle Virtual Machine tutorials out there that typically show you how to use a free VM is that the VM is much more difficult to configure than just about any other product / offering out there.<br>
The symptom you will have is that nobody will be able to connect.  This is not because of the second set of ports that it shows after startup (that is a nearly 3-4 years now old Bedrock bug and all servers do it).<br>
It is because there are several steps you need to take to open the ports on the Oracle VM.  You need to both:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Set the ingress ports (TCP/UDP) in the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) security list</li>
  <li>*and* set the ingress ports in a Network Security Group assigned to your instance</li>
</ul><br>
Both of these settings are typically required before you will be able to connect to your VM instance.  This is purely configuration related and has nothing to do with the script or the Minecraft server itself.<br><br>
I do not recommend this platform due to the configuration difficulty but the people who have gone through the pain of configuring an Oracle VM have had good experiences with it after that point.  Just keep in mind it's going to be a rough ride through the configuration for most people.<br><br>

<h2>Troubleshooting Note - Hyper-V</h2>
There is a weird bug in Hyper-V that breaks UDP connections on the Minecraft server.  The fix for this is that you have to use a Generation 1 VM with the Legacy LAN network driver.<br>

  <ul>
    <li>Add clean.sh utility script to clean up downloads folder, remove version pinning and force reinstall of current version</li>
    <li>Enable content log by default which shows errors related to resource/behavior packs</li>
  </ul>
  <li>August 12th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Add clean.sh utility script to clean up downloads folder, remove version pinning and force reinstall of current version</li>
    <li>Enable content log by default which shows errors related to resource/behavior packs</li>
  </ul>
  <li>August 10th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Moved DirName variable to a custom variable at the top of SetupMinecraft.sh</li>
  </ul>
  <li>August 4th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Script now removes non-alphanumeric characters from the servername variable (to prevent using quotes and other symbols that will break it)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>August 2nd 2022</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Add Box64 support for 64 bit ARM (aarch64).  32 bit ARM is not recommended as it cannot use Box64 so it will be much slower than if you install a 64-bit version of your OS on the device.</li>
      <li>You must be running a 64-bit OS to benefit from the Box64 increased speeds (both Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi OS have 64-bit versions)</li>
      <li>An easy way to check and make sure you are running 64 bit is to use <pre>uname -m</pre> which will return ""aarch64"" if you are on 64-bit ARM</li>
    </ul>
  <li>July 24th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Use libssl1.1 from repository instead of Ubuntu servers due to it changing every week or two (thanks theblujuice, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/129"">issue #129)</a></li>
    </ul>
  <li>July 21st 2022</li>
    <ul>

  <li>July 14th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Add libssl3 to dependencies</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
  <li>June 11th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Added allowlist.json and permissions.json default template files to prevent crashes when they are missing (thanks Eike)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>June 10th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed problem in escaping screen command in SetupMinecraft.sh (on the startup check)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>June 5th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Added additional escaping to screen -list commands to prevent similar names from matching the grep query (thanks wheelibin)</li>
        <li>Changed grep -q command to use single quotes to prevent expansion of additional characters (I still recommend only letters and numbers for the server label/name for the least amount of trouble)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>May 31st 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Add check to make sure server.properties exists when unzipping server as without it there will be a startup error</li>
    </ul>
  <li>May 26th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Add revert.sh to SetupMinecraft.sh downloads</li>
        <li>Add version override documentation</li>
    </ul>
  <li>May 25th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Added version_pin.txt to allow for manual override of running server version. Run ./revert.sh in your server folder to set version n-1 to run on next restart. Delete version_pin.txt when you want to resume automatic updates. (thanks smallsam)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>May 15th 2022</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Added screen -wipe to beginning of start.sh to prevent a startup issue that could occur if there was a ""dead"" screen instance (thanks grimholme)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>May 9th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated fallback installation URL for OpenSSL 1.1</li>
  </ul>
  <li>May 4th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue on Debian where the route command (/sbin/route) is not on the default path by adding a check for this</li>
    <li>Added Ubuntu 22.04 to tested distributions list (I upgraded my desktop OS to this today)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 28th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a line in fixpermissions.sh that could cause picky shells to complain</li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 24th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added dependency package install for libssl1.1 when it's available in apt</li>
    <li>Added fallback installation for libssl1.1 to hopefully fix the installer for Ubuntu 22.04/22.10 and other distros using libssl3</li>
    <li>Fixed a minor 'tail' error message that could occur upon starting the server if no logs were created yet</li>
    <li>Added DEBIAN_NONINTERACTIVE to some apt commands to try to suppress some interactive dialogs (such as running outdated kernel) that were causing the installer to get stuck</li>
    <li>Fixed a mistake in new multicore backup causing it to select the wrong compressor</li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 16th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added multiple CPU core support for backups which should speed up backup process</li>
  </ul>
  <li>March 19th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Removed /sbin qualifier from route command as the PATH variable is now stored at the top of each script by SetupMinecraft.sh (thanks LookedPath, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/120"">issue #120</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>March 10th 2022</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Add new allowlist.json to the unzip whitelist (thanks shaman79, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/118"">issue #118</a>)</li>
    <li>Added buy a coffe / donation information (thanks vandersonmota, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/117"">issue #117</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>November 2nd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed extra / in front of permissions fix script (thanks MarkBarbieri, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/109"">issue #109</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>October 31st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed missing sudo from fixpermissions line in start.sh (thanks MarkBarbieri, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/109"">issue #109</a>)</li>
    <li>Fixed missing -a parameter from /etc/sudoers file addition thanks MarkBarbieri, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/109"">issue #109</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>August 1st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated documentation and root path selection prompt to make it more clear that the root directory should be the same for ALL servers</li>
    <li>Don't change unless installing to a different disk, and then use the same root path for ALL servers as they will follow the structure $ROOTPATH/minecraftbe/yourservername</li>
    <li>Choosing a perfect storm of invalid paths has resulted in people's server files being pruned before from being off by one folder sublevel etc.  Please follow instructions carefully here and do not change it and make sure you have backups (saved outside of the main Minecraft backups folder) before ever trying to install an additional server or updating existing scripts.</li>
    <li>Fortunately this person was starting a new server so the pruning didn't get anything serious but I can't stress enough to leave the paths alone unless you're legitimately an expert with a use case like having an entire separate disk for all the Minecraft servers.  Use the same root directory every time (preferably the default)!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 27th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Cleaned up SetupMinecraft.sh and removed redundant code by organizing code into functions</li>
    <li>Scripts now fix all server file permissions on startup</li>
    <li>Added /etc/sudoers.d/minecraftbe file to contain passwordless sudo permission for fixpermissions and sudo systemctl start server</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 21st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated documentation and restart.sh to document how to enable systemd's service showing as ""online"" after called by restart.sh (useful for people tracking the servers using the systemd service) by adding a line to the sudoers file to allow passwordless sudo for the sudo systemctl start yourservername command.  Restart.sh now has commented lines at the bottom along with instructions on how to enable if you need this functionality (most people probably won't)</li>
    <li>Added error redirection to crontab line to help diagnose failures during scheduled restarts and removed ExecStartPre from the service as it wasn't doing anything (run ./fixpermissions.sh if you need to fix the permissions) and caused compatibility issues with older systemd versions</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 17th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added in check to ensure start.sh and other scripts are not being ran as root.  If this happens you have to use sudo screen -r to find the screen and the permissions will be wrong since root isn't the owner of the server files</li>
    <li>If you know you ran the script/server as root (which starts creating files owned by root instead of the regular user) and your server won't start/is wonky run the fixpermissions script from your server folder with ./fixpermissions.sh and it will correct them for you!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 15th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added update.sh convenience script to run SetupMinecraft.sh to update everything to the latest version</li>
    <li>Added validation loop for directory path -- if you are upgrading from an old version you should use the default directory.</li>
    <li>Nothing good can come from changing this and I've never seen or heard of it solving a single problem despite being requested for years (especially if you don't understand relative vs fully qualified Linux paths and other pitfalls -- leave it default!).</li>
    <li>Attempting to solve this problem with safety checks in case this is useful to some people and I just haven't heard about it but it may be removed entirely or turned into a check that you have to download and modify the script to enable if it continues to be a source of strife for people.</li>
    <li>Updated depends.zip for Raspberry Pis</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 4th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added missing sudo line to some prerequistes and removed apt-get install sudo as the script no longer runs as root (install sudo if missing) - thanks Rick Horn</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 3rd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added Accept-Encoding: Identity header to curl as a very small % of users are getting an ""Access Denied"" error without this header (thanks titiscan, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/pull/95"">pull request #95</a></li>
    <li>Added default language header to curl as non-english computers were getting an Access Denied error</li>
    <li>Script now checks for gawk being present in start.sh.  If it's not installed (likely due to reusing old SetupMinecraft.sh files) timestamps will be disabled.  This will prevent the server from failing to start.  This is avoided by not running an old copy of SetupMinecraft.sh!</li>
    <li>Removed broken screen -r command at the end of SetupMinecraft.sh as fixing it actually causes lockups -- instead now gives the command (screen -r) to pull up the Minecraft console.  Press Ctrl+A then Ctrl+D to hide the console once you're inside it.</li>
    <li>Added code to prevent SetupMinecraft.sh from being ran as a local file (please use the new method of curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/master/SetupMinecraft.sh | bash)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 2nd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved dependency detection and installation</li>
    <li>Removed wget dependency</li>
    <li>Added gawk dependency -- this should not have any impact on most systems but on systems that use mawk by default this will fix server startup issues related to timestamps since mawk doesn't support strftime</li>
    <li>Fixed stop.sh's -t countdown option (thanks da99Beast, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/76"">issue #76</a>)</li>
    <li>Fixed a nasty issue where the installation of libcurl3 over the top of libcurl4 was allowed in some configurations (like Ubuntu 18.04) and was clobbering curl (thanks Goretech)</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where empty folders could be created in the wrong location if start.sh was not ran from the server folder (thanks CobraBitYou, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/93"">issue #93</a></li>
  </ul>
  <li>July 1st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Changed from wget to curl as wget is freezing (but curl works)</li>
    <li>Added randomization to user agent</li>
  </ul>
  <li>June 19th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed timestamps to display on every line (thanks murkyl)</li>
    <li>Added chmod command after unzip line to make bedrock_server executable for <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/22"">issue #22</a> (thanks murkyl)</li>
    <li>Merged <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/pull/91"">pull request #91</a> from starkey-01 to add prompt for an alternate installation directory.  This has been requested for a while so thanks starkey-01!</li>
    <li>Merged <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/pull/88"">pull request #88</a> clarifying instructions to run script as non-root user (thanks sparagi!)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>May 23nd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The fixpermissions.sh script now displays the last 5 lines from the latest log file to aid in troubleshooting.  If your server won't start this script often will take care of it and the logs can give useful information otherwise!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>May 22nd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added setting the path variable to each script to prevent service from failing to start due to not being able to find the right path.</li>
    <li>Please redownload SetupMinecraft.sh for this update.  The script will give you a warning each time you start up that it couldn't set the path variable without the new SetupMinecraft.sh script</li>
    <li>Added user agent to wget string to prevent update check from failing</li>
    <li>Added automatic update to SetupMinecraft.sh if it has not been modified for more than 7 days</li>
    <li>Updated Raspberry Pi dependencies</li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 22nd 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added a safety check to prevent installing on 32 bit (i386 or i686) operating systems.  The official Bedrock dedicated server has only been released as a 64 bit (x86_64) binary and attempts at emulation on 32 bit have failed to yield any successful results!</li>
    <li>Added chmod +x bedrock_server to start.sh as updates seem to be removing executable permissions sometimes</li>
    <li>Fix removing old backup directory context (thanks murkyl, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/issues/76"">issue #76</a>)<li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 20th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fully qualified route command with /sbin/route to alleviate network check breaking some servers</li>
    <li>Added safety check to prevent using the server label 'minecraftbe' which can break the scripts</li>
    <li>Added libc6 dependency check as several people have reported libns1.so.1 missing</li>
    <li>Added curl and libcurl3 dependency as a fallback for older distros to avoid missing libcurl.so errors</li>
    <li>Added libcrypt1 dependency check</li>
  </ul>
  <li>April 7th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are updating from an old version make sure you remove the old SetupMinecraft.sh and redownload the new version from scratch.  If you are seeing something like userxname in the systemd service you're using an old version of SetupMinecraft.sh and need to download the latest</li>
    <li>Updated fixpermissions.sh -- can fix issues with permissions if you are seeing them!</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with userxname appearing in start.sh and not being updated to the correct username</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue that could trigger PAM authentication in start.sh</li>
  </ul>
  <li>March 16th 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a incomplete sudo line in start.sh that was throwing an error (thanks /u/zfa from reddit!)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>February 1st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added fixpermissions.sh utility script to take ownership of Minecraft server files manually (the systemd startup service does this automatically for you if you are using it)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>January 31st 2021</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added .\ in front of the screen -q checks to prevent similar usernames from tripping up window detection</li>
    <li>Server now takes ownership of server files on each start to prevent folks a whole heap of trouble and heartache when restoring backups/moving files/etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>December 20th 2020</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added experimental QEMU support for 32 bit (i386, i686) similar to how the ARM support works</li>
  </ul>
  <li>December 18th 2020</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added safety check to prevent the script from being ran as root or sudo.  This would cause the script to be installed to the /root folder.</li>
    <li>If you know what you are doing and want to override just edit the check out of SetupMinecraft.sh but otherwise just run it as ./SetupMinecraft.sh normally.</li>
    <li>Fixed a nasty bug that could cause start.sh and stop.sh to disapper (thanks Paul and James).  This was related to log pruning and not having a hard path.  If you downloaded the SetupMinecraft script in the past 3 days update and try again here and you'll be set!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>December 15th 2020</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Resource packs (including ones that optionally enable RTX support) are working</li>
    <li>Guide available at <a href=""https://jamesachambers.com/minecraft-bedrock-server-resource-pack-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://jamesachambers.com/minecraft-bedrock-server-resource-pack-guide/</a></li>

    <li>Updated depends.zip</li>
  </ul>
  <li>December 10th 2020</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Cleaned up documentation</li>

  <li>July 1st 2019</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for multiple servers</li>
    <li>Choose the folder name and port for the server in SetupMinecraft.sh (must be unique per server instance)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>May 23rd 2019</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed typo in restart.sh where there was a space after stop command preventing the server from closing cleanly</li>
    <li>Added 10 second sleep after a force close to give the server time to fully close before calling start.sh</li>
    <li>Fixed server not restarting after scheduled nightly reboot (related to restart.sh bug)</li>

## About this Repository

This is the repository of the project for translating Minecraft mods into simplified Chinese, currectly using a platform called Weblate which is similar to Crowdin.<br>
This project aims to deal with certain problems where localizations are not accepted in time or simply fail to be accepted.<br>
If you want to join us, please visit our official website and learn more:<br>
### <https://cfpa.team>

It is also fine to submit pull requests to this repository.

Before you start, check the important tips from us here: [*Regulations and Guidelines for Simplified Chinese Translation of Minecraft Mods*](https://github.com/Meow-J/Mod-Translation-Styleguide/blob/master/README.md).

## Usage

Download the *released* version [here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/simplified-chinese-localization-resource-package) or the *snapshot* version [here](https://github.com/CFPAOrg/Minecraft-Mod-Language-Package/releases/latest).<br>
To apply, simply load this pack like any other resource pack. In case of some issues, restarting Minecraft after loading is recommended.

## Related Information

**How does the current localization project look like? Can I submit my list of mods that I want them to be translated?**<br>
Currently, according to the popularity on CurseForge, we have chosen Minecraft 1.12.2 for the majority of our work, with over 1000 mods in the project. If you want any other mod to be translated, you can suggest through our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CFPAOrg/Minecraft-Mod-Language-Package/issues), or email us directly.<br>

We have been propagating this project on [the MCBBS page](http://www.mcbbs.net/thread-774087-1-1.html).

The history of this project can be seen in [TartaricAcid's blog](https://baka943.coding.me/2018/01/03/2018-01-03-AnIntroForWeblate/).

**How did you guys set up the workflow?**<br>
Ummmm, it's easy though:<br>

- Get the popular mods on CurseForge with the web scraper.
- Push the files to the GitHub repository with scripts
- Pull the updates from GitHub to Weblate automatically when detecting changes in the repository.
- The translators translate on Weblate, and Weblate push the changes to GitHub automatically.
- Github Actions builds and packs automatically when detecting changes in the repository.
- Github Actions publish packs to the GitHub release automatically so that the packs can be downloaded.

Please note that Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios(Microsoft) where players interact with a fully modifiable three-dimensional environment made of blocks and entities.  And this project is a tutorial that shows how to make a game like Minecraft using Unity and DOTS technologies.

Packages needed:
Entities 1.0.0-exp.8
Entities graphics 1.0.0-exp.8
Unity Physics 1.0.0-exp.8

Unity Version:
2022.2.0b10

It's been 4 years since last time I update this project. and I hope you can learn some Unity DOTS technologies from it! Enjoy it!

12,docker/dockercraft,Lua,"# Dockercraft

![Dockercraft](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/logo.png?raw=true)

A simple Minecraft Docker client, to visualize and manage Docker containers.

![Dockercraft](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/dockercraft.gif?raw=true)

[YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZDlJgJf55o)

> WARNING: Please use Dockercraft on your local machine only.
> It currently doesn't support authentication.
> Every player should be considered a root user! 

## How to run Dockercraft

1. **Install Minecraft: [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net)**

	The Minecraft client hasn't been modified, just get the official release.

2. **Pull or build Dockercraft image:** (an official image will be available soon)

	```
	docker pull gaetan/dockercraft
	```
	or

	```
	git clone git@github.com:docker/dockercraft.git
	docker build -t gaetan/dockercraft dockercraft
	```
3. **Run Dockercraft container:**

	```
	docker run -t -i -d -p 25565:25565 \
	-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
	--name dockercraft \
	gaetan/dockercraft
	```

	Mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` inside the container is necessary to send requests to the Docker remote API.

	The default port for a Minecraft server is *25565*, if you prefer a different one: `-p <port>:25565`

4. **Open Minecraft > Multiplayer > Add Server**

	The server address is the IP of Docker host. No need to specify a port if you used the default one.

	If you're using [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/): `docker-machine ip <machine_name>`

5. **Join Server!**

	You should see at least one container in your world, which is the one hosting your Dockercraft server.

	You can start, stop and remove containers interacting with levers and buttons. Some Docker commands are also supported directly via Minecraft's chat window, which is displayed by pressing the `T` key (default) or `/` key.
	
> A command always starts with a `/`.
> 
> If you open the prompt using the `/` key, it will be prefilled with a `/` character, but if you open it with the `T` key, it will not be prefilled and you will have to type a `/` yourself before typing your docker command.
> 
> example: `/docker run redis`.

![Dockercraft](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/landscape.png?raw=true)

## Customizing Dockercraft

Do you find the plains too plain?
If so, you are in luck!

Dockercraft can be customised to use any of the [Biomes](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/blob/7f8a4eb7264a12ca2035b4e4d412485e01f309d4/src/BiomeDef.cpp#L17) and [Finishers](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/blob/7f8a4eb7264a12ca2035b4e4d412485e01f309d4/src/Generating/ComposableGenerator.cpp#L299) supported by Cuberite!

You can pass these additional arguments to your `docker run` command:
```
docker run -t -i -d -p 25565:25565 \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --name dockercraft \
    gaetan/dockercraft <biome> <groundlevel> <sealevel> <finishers>
```

Here are some examples:

**Do you long for the calm of the oceans?**
![oceans](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/ocean.png?raw=true)

Try `Ocean 50 63`, or for a more frozen alternative, `FrozenOcean 50 63 Ice`

**Or perhaps the heat of the desert?**
![desert](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/desert.png?raw=true)

Then `Desert 63 0 DeadBushes` is what you need

**Are you pining for the... Pines?**
![forest](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/forest.png?raw=true)
We have you covered. Try `Forest 63 0 Trees`

**Or maybe you are looking for fun and games?**
![jungle](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/jungle.png?raw=true)
If so, Welcome to the Jungle. `Jungle 63 0 Trees`

## Upcoming features

This is just the beginning for Dockercraft! We should be able to support a lot more Docker features like:

- List [Docker Machines](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) and use portals to see what's inside
- Support more Docker commands
- Display [logs](https://docs.docker.com/v1.8/reference/commandline/logs/) (for each container, pushing a simple button)
- Represent links
- Docker networking
- Docker volumes
- ...

If you're interested about Dockercraft's design, discussions happen in [that issue](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/issues/19).
Also, we're using [Magicavoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) to do these nice prototypes:

![Dockercraft](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/raw/master/docs/img/voxelproto.jpg?raw=true)

You can find our Magicavoxel patterns in [that folder](![Dockercraft](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft/tree/master/docs/magicavoxel)).

To get fresh news, follow our Twitter account: [@dockercraft](https://twitter.com/dockercraft).

## How it works

The Minecraft client itself remains unmodified. All operations are done server side.

The Minecraft server we use is [http://cuberite.org](http://cuberite.org). A custom Minecraft compatible game server written in C++. [github repo](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite)

This server accepts plugins, scripts written in Lua. So we did one for Docker. (world/Plugins/Docker)

Unfortunately, there's no nice API to communicate with these plugins. But there's a webadmin, and plugins can be responsible for ""webtabs"".

```lua
Plugin:AddWebTab(""Docker"",HandleRequest_Docker)
```

Basically it means the plugin can catch POST requests sent to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/webadmin/Docker/Docker`.

### Goproxy

Events from the Docker remote API are transmitted to the Lua plugin by a small daemon (written in Go). (go/src/goproxy)

```go
func MCServerRequest(data url.Values, client *http.Client) {
	req, _ := http.NewRequest(""POST"", ""http://127.0.0.1:8080/webadmin/Docker/Docker"", strings.NewReader(data.Encode()))
	req.Header.Set(""Content-Type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"")
	req.SetBasicAuth(""admin"", ""admin"")
	client.Do(req)
}
```

The goproxy binary can also be executed with parameters from the Lua plugin, to send requests to the daemon:

```lua
function PlayerJoined(Player)
	-- refresh containers
	r = os.execute(""goproxy containers"")
end
```

14,Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge,C++,"# MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge

I challenged myself to see if I could create Minecraft in just one week... So lets go!

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq3isov6mZ8

Note: I continued to edit after the 7 days, however the version seen in the video is found here https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge/tree/eb01640580cc5ad403f6a8b9fb58af37e2f03f0c

And the ""optimized"" version can be found here: https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge/tree/792df07e9780b444be5290fd05a3c8598aacafc8 (~1 week later version) 

There also is a version of this game with very good graphics, and things like a day/night cycle. However, it was causing rendering issues for many people. This version can be found here:
https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge/tree/aa50ad8077ef0e617a9cfc336bdb7db81c313017

## Other People's Projects

This was made in a week, as a challenge for a video. There do exist other, more mature and developed Minecraft clones written in C++.

MineTest here: https://github.com/minetest/minetest

## Building

You will need GLM and SFML 2.4.1+ libraries w/headers, and this also requires a compiler that supports C++14 (or newer) with threads.

### macOS

Install macports from https://www.macports.org 

`sudo port install sfml glm`

### Ubuntu

`sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev libglm-dev`

## Compile Source and Runnimg

### Linux

#### Debug

```sh
sh scripts/build.sh
sh scripts/run.sh
```

#### Release

```sh
sh scripts/build.sh release
sh scripts/run.sh release
```

## The Challenge

### Day One

End of day one commit: https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge/tree/44ace72573833796da05a97972be5765b05ce94f

The first day was spent setting up boilerplate code such as the game state/ game screen system, and the basic rendering engines, starting off with a mere quad.

The day was finished off by creating a first person camera.

The second day was spent setting up the basic ChunkSection and various block classes.

I also worked out the coordinates for a cube, and thus created a cube renderer.

I finished up the day attempting to create a mesh builder for the chunk; however, this did not go well at all, and two had ended before I got it to work correctly.

To start the day off, I fixed the chunk drawing. Turns out I was telling OpenGL the indices were ```GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE```, but they were actually ```GL_UNSIGNED_INT```. This took 3 hours to work out...

![gl bytesss](http://i.imgur.com/PD44aRg.png)

Anyways, after this I got the game working with more chunks. I now have an area of 16x16 chunks, made out of chunk sections of 16x16x16 blocks.

To finish the day off, I got some naive block editing to work.

### Day 4

The first thing I did on day 4 was create a sky box using OpenGL cube maps.

After this, I started work on the world generation, eg adding height map and trees.

### Day 5

I started off the day by cleaning up some of the chunk code, and then proceeded to make the world infinite, but
I felt it was not needed, so I simply went back to a fixed-sized world.

I then added an item system. My implementation probably was not great for this, but it was my first time
at creating that sort of the thing.

Basically, when a player breaks a block, it gets added to their inventory. When they place a block, a block
is placed.

### Day 6

Mostly optimizations, such as view-frustum culling and making the mesh building faster.

### Day 7

Focus on improving how it looks, eg adding directional lighting

Also implemented concurency :)

15,EngineHub/WorldEdit,Java,"<h1>
    <img src=""worldedit-logo.svg"" alt=""WorldEdit"" width=""400"" /> 
</h1>

**A Minecraft Map Editor... that runs in-game!**

* With selections, schematics, copy and paste, brushes, and scripting!
* Use it in creative, survival in single player or on your server.
* Use it on your Minecraft server to fix grieving and mistakes.

Java Edition required. WorldEdit is compatible with Forge, Fabric, Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, and Sponge.

## Download WorldEdit

This place contains the Java code for WorldEdit, but if you want to just use WorldEdit, get the mod or plugin from these pages:

* For the mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit
* For the server plugin: https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit

Edit the Code
---------

Want to add new features to WorldEdit or fix bugs yourself? You can get the game running, with WorldEdit, from the code here, without any additional outside steps, by doing the following *four* things:

1. Download WorldEdit's source code and put it somewhere. We recommend you use something called Git if you already know how to use it, but [you can also just download a .zip file](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEdit/archive/master.zip). (If you plan on contributing the changes, you will need to figure out Git.)
2. Install any version of Java greater than or equal to 16.
   * Note that if you do _not_ install JDK 16 exactly, Gradle will download it for you on first run. However, it is still required to have some form of Java installed for Gradle to start at all.
3. Open terminal / command prompt / bash and navigate to the directory where you put the source code.
4. Run **one** of these following commands:
   * Mac OS X / Linux: `./gradlew :worldedit-fabric:runClient`
   * Windows - Command Prompt: `gradlew :worldedit-fabric:runClient`
   * Windows - PowerShell: `.\gradlew :worldedit-fabric:runClient`

🎉 That's it. 🎉 It takes a long time to actually transform WorldEdit into a mod. If it succeeds, **the Minecraft game will open and you can create a single player world with WorldEdit**.

When you make changes to the code, you have to restart the game by re-running the command for your changes to take effect. If there are errors in your Java syntax, the command will fail.

For additional information about compiling WorldEdit, see [COMPILING.md](COMPILING.md).

### Using a Java IDE

To edit WorldEdit in a Java IDE, follow these steps:

1. Download and install [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
2. In the IDE, open the folder that you saved WorldEdit's code in. This creates a new project in IDEA.

That's pretty much it.

If you want to be able to run the game also, follow these instructions:

1. Go to Run -> Edit Configurations.
2. Add a Gradle task:
   1. Choose `worldedit-fabric` for the project.
   2. For the tasks, type in `runClient`
3. Click OK
4. Under the Run menu again, go to ""Debug [your new task]"".

### Speeding up the Edit-Test-Edit-Test Cycle

It's a little annoying have to restart the game to test your changes. The best way to reduce the time is to run the server instead (using `runServer` instead of `runClient`) and then reconnect to the server after restarting it.

Submitting Your Changes
------------

WorldEdit is open source (specifically licensed under GPL v3), so note that your contributions will also be open source. The best way to submit a change is to create a fork on GitHub, put your changes there, and then create a ""pull request"" on our WorldEdit repository.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for important guidelines to follow.

# Mekanism for Minecraft 1.19 #

Mekanism is an independent Minecraft add-on featuring high-tech machinery that can be used to create powerful tools, 
armor, and weapons. You can find more detail on the features on the [**Official Website**](http://aidancbrady.com/mekanism/).
With features ranging from jetpacks and balloons to factories and energy cubes, the mod does not have a single unifying goal.
Nevertheless, these features combine coherently to create a rich gameplay experience that players will enjoy.

Mekanism uses a tier-based system to organize the majority of its core features, like energy cubes and factories.
There are four tiers: basic, advanced, elite, and ultimate. Players can upgrade their components to the next tier
by placing each component in a crafting grid and surrounding it with the necessary resources for the upgrade or in
world by using tier installers.

After using Mekanism for a while, players can obtain a near-indestructible suit of Refined Obsidian Armor, receive five 
ingots for each ore mined, fly with hydrogen-powered jetpacks, and have cute robotic friends following them around while they mine. :)

# Discord #

Mekanism has a [discord server](https://discord.gg/nmSjMGc) where you can chat with other Mekanism users and the developers. Join us!

19,ddevault/TrueCraft,C#,"You've downloaded TrueCraft, an open source implementation of Minecraft beta
1.7.3. Please note that TrueCraft is still experimental, and is likely to
include bugs and unfinished features.

                           === Running TrueCraft ===

On Windows, double click `TrueCraft.Launcher.exe`. This will allow you to play
singleplayer and connect to multiplayer servers.

On Linux and OS X, run `mono TrueCraft.Launcher.exe` from a terminal.

                            === Running Servers ===

You've also been given the TrueCraft server. If you want to run a server to play
with your friends, you will need to forward port 25565 on your router.

Run `TrueCraft.exe` to host a server. On Linux and OS X, you can run `mono
TrueCraft.exe` to host the server.

If you do not want to host the server yourself, try https://gamocosm.com.

                           === Updating TrueCraft ===

TrueCraft is updated all the time. Download new versions from:

https://truecraft.io

Eventually TrueCraft will update itself automatically. Until then, you'll have
to update it yourself manually.

                               === Community ===

You aren't the only one playing TrueCraft! Come hang out with us:

* /r/truecraft
* #truecraft on irc.esper.net

                              === Source Code ===

## Data quality

Minecraft data provides scripts to audit the data, they can be useful to check the data is correct :

 * [audit_blocks](tools/js/test/audit_blocks.js)
 * [audit_items](tools/js/test/audit_items.js)
 * [audit_recipes](tools/js/test/audit_recipes.js)
 * [audit_shapes](tools/js/test/audit_shapes.js)

Minecraft data also provides json schemas in enums_schemas/ that are used in
test/test.js to check the json file are valid relative to these schemas.
These schemas can also be used to understand better how the json files are
formatted in order to use it.

23,xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query,PHP,"# PHP Minecraft Query [![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/xpaw/php-minecraft-query.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/xpaw/php-minecraft-query)

This library can be used to query Minecraft servers for some basic information.

**:warning: Please do not create issues when you are unable to retrieve information from a server, unless you can prove that there is a bug within the library.**

## Differences between Ping and Query

There are two methods of retrieving information about a Minecraft server.

### Ping
Ping protocol was added in Minecraft 1.7 and is used to query the server for minimal amount of information (hostname, motd, icon, and a sample of players). This is easier to use and doesn't require extra setup on server side. It uses TCP protocol on the same port as you would connect to your server.

`MinecraftPing` class contains a method `QueryOldPre17` which can be used to query servers on version 1.6 or older.

### Query
This method uses GameSpy4 protocol, and requires enabling `query` listener in your `server.properties` like this:

> *enable-query=true*<br>
> *query.port=25565*

Query allows to request a full list of servers' plugins and players, however this method is more prone to breaking, so if you don't need all this information, stick to the ping method as it's more reliable.

## RCON
It is possible to send console commands to a Minecraft server remotely using the [Source RCON protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol). Use [PHP Source Query](https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Source-Query-Class) library for your RCON needs.

## SRV DNS record
This library automatically tries to resolve SRV records. If you do not wish to do so, pass `false` as the fourth param in the constructor (after timeout param).

## Example
```php
<?php
	require __DIR__ . '/src/MinecraftPing.php';
	require __DIR__ . '/src/MinecraftPingException.php';
	
	use xPaw\MinecraftPing;
	use xPaw\MinecraftPingException;
	
	try
	{
		$Query = new MinecraftPing( 'localhost', 25565 );
		
		print_r( $Query->Query() );
	}
	catch( MinecraftPingException $e )
	{
		echo $e->getMessage();
	}
	finally
	{
		if( $Query )
		{
			$Query->Close();
		}
	}
?>
```

If you want to get `ping` info from a server that uses a version older than Minecraft 1.7,
then use function `QueryOldPre17` instead of `Query`.

----

If the server has query enabled (`enable-query`), then you can use `MinecraftQuery` to more retrieve information about a server.
```php
<?php
	require __DIR__ . '/src/MinecraftQuery.php';
	require __DIR__ . '/src/MinecraftQueryException.php';
	
	use xPaw\MinecraftQuery;
	use xPaw\MinecraftQueryException;
	
	$Query = new MinecraftQuery( );
	
	try
	{
		$Query->Connect( 'localhost', 25565 );
		
		print_r( $Query->GetInfo( ) );
		print_r( $Query->GetPlayers( ) );
	}
	catch( MinecraftQueryException $e )
	{
		echo $e->getMessage( );
	}
?>
```

For Bedrock servers (MCPE) use `ConnectBedrock` function instead of `Connect`, then `GetInfo` will work.

Geyser is a bridge between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition, closing the gap from those wanting to play true cross-platform.

Geyser is an open collaboration project by [CubeCraft Games](https://cubecraft.net).

## What is Geyser?
Geyser is a proxy, bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition servers.
The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible. However, due to the nature of Geyser translating packets over the network of two different games, *do not expect everything to work perfectly!*

Special thanks to the DragonProxy project for being a trailblazer in protocol translation and for all the team members who have joined us here!

### Currently supporting Minecraft Bedrock 1.19.20 - 1.19.51 and Minecraft Java 1.19.3.

## Setting Up
Take a look [here](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/setup/) for how to set up Geyser.

- Donate: https://opencollective.com/geysermc
- Test Server: `test.geysermc.org` port `25565` for Java and `19132` for Bedrock

## What's Left to be Added/Fixed
- Near-perfect movement (to the point where anticheat on large servers is unlikely to ban you)
- Some Entity Flags
- Structure block UI

## What can't be fixed
There are a few things Geyser is unable to support due to various differences between Minecraft Bedrock and Java. For a list of these limitations, see the [Current Limitations](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/current-limitations/) page.

## Compiling
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Navigate to the Geyser root directory and run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. This command downloads all the needed submodules for Geyser and is a crucial step in this process.
3. Run `gradlew build` and locate to `bootstrap/build` folder.

这是用Python和Pyglet写的简单的Minecraft游戏，
从<https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft>fork过来的，
一共只有几百行代码，麻雀虽小，五脏俱全，觉得挺有意思的，
于是把源码读了一遍，并做了详细的注释。
通过这个例子学习Pyglet和Python游戏编程还是不错的，推荐。

以下是游戏视频：

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC3lwK631X8

## How to Run

    pip install pyglet
    git clone https://github.com/Hawstein/PyMinecraft.git
    cd PyMinecraft
    python main.py

在windows和mac下，pyglet还不支持64 python，对于64 mac，可以试一下：

	export VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes
    arch -i386 python main.py
	
或者使用支持64位的Pyglet 1.2：

	pip install https://pyglet.googlecode.com/files/pyglet-1.2alpha1.tar.gz

27,jkutner/heroku-buildpack-minecraft,Shell,"# Heroku Minecraft Buildpack

This is a [Heroku Buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks)
for running a Minecraft server in a [dyno](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos).

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Usage

Create a [free ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/) and copy your Auth token. Then create a new Git project with a `eula.txt` file:

```sh-session
$ echo 'eula=true' > eula.txt
$ git init
$ git add eula.txt
$ git commit -m ""first commit""
```

Then, install the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/).
Create a Heroku app, set your ngrok token, and push:

```sh-session
$ heroku create
$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/python
$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/jvm
$ heroku buildpacks:add jkutner/minecraft
$ heroku config:set NGROK_API_TOKEN=""xxxxx""
$ git push heroku master
```

Finally, open the app:

```sh-session
$ heroku open
```

This will display the ngrok logs, which will contain the name of the server
(really it's a proxy, but whatever):

```
Server available at: 0.tcp.ngrok.io:17003
```

Copy the `0.tcp.ngrok.io:17003` part, and paste it into your local Minecraft app
as the server name.

## Syncing to S3

The Heroku filesystem is [ephemeral](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem),
which means files written to the file system will be destroyed when the server is restarted.

Minecraft keeps all of the data for the server in flat files on the file system.
Thus, if you want to keep you world, you'll need to sync it to S3.

First, create an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) and an S3 bucket. Then configure the bucket
and your AWS keys like this:

```
$ heroku config:set AWS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
$ heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
$ heroku config:set AWS_SECRET_KEY=xxx
```

The buildpack will sync your world to the bucket every 60 seconds, but this is configurable by setting the `AWS_SYNC_INTERVAL` config var.

## Connecting to the server console

The Minecraft server runs inside a `screen` session. You can use [Heroku Exec](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-exec) to connect to your server console.

Once you have Heroku Exec installed, you can connect to the console using

```
$ heroku ps:exec
Establishing credentials... done
Connecting to web.1 on ⬢ lovely-minecraft-2351...
$ screen -r minecraft
```

**WARNING** You are now connected to the Minecraft server. Use `Ctrl-A Ctrl-D` to exit the screen session.
(If you hit `Ctrl-C` while in the session, you'll terminate the Minecraft server.)

## Customizing

### ngrok

You can customize ngrok by setting the `NGROK_OPTS` config variable. For example:

```
$ heroku config:set NGROK_OPTS=""--remote-addr 1.tcp.ngrok.io:25565""
```

### Minecraft

You can choose the Minecraft version by setting the MINECRAFT_VERSION like so:

```
$ heroku config:set MINECRAFT_VERSION=""1.18.1""
```

You can also configure the server properties by creating a `server.properties`
file in your project and adding it to Git. This is how you would set things like
Creative mode and Hardcore difficulty. The various options available are
described on the [Minecraft Wiki](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties).

You can add files such as `banned-players.json`, `banned-ips.json`, `ops.json`,
`whitelist.json` to your Git repository and the Minecraft server will pick them up.

### Adding New Minecraft Versions

Please submit Pull Requests to [`etc/files.json`](https://github.com/jkutner/heroku-buildpack-minecraft/blob/master/etc/files.json)

### Using the Buildpack from source

If you want the bleeding edge version of this buildpack run:

```
$ heroku buildpacks:remove jkutner/minecraft
$ heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/jkutner/heroku-buildpack-minecraft
```

ScriptCraft lets you write Minecraft Mods using Javascript - a
programming language that's relatively easy to learn and use.
ScriptCraft is a Minecraft Server plugin which means it must be used
with a Minecraft server. Once you've downloaded and installed the
Minecraft Server, then installed the ScriptCraft Plugin you can write
your own Minecraft mods using Javascript.

I created ScriptCraft to make it easier for younger programmers to
create their own Minecraft Mods. Mods are written using the
JavaScript programming language. Once the ScriptCraft mod is
installed, you can add your own new Mods by adding JavaScript (.js)
files in a directory.

 * If you're new to programming and want to start modding Minecraft, then [Start Here][yp].
 * If you've already used [Scratch][scr], have attended a few
   [CoderDojo][cd] sessions, or have already dabbled with JavaScript,
   then [Start Here][cda].
 * Watch some [demos][ytpl] of what you can do with ScriptCraft.

This is a simple mod in a file called greet.js in the scriptcraft/plugins directory:

```javascript
function greet( player ) {
  echo( player, 'Hello ' + player.name );
}
exports.greet = greet;
```

At the in-game prompt, type:

```javascript
/js greet(self)
```

Anything you can do using the Spigot or CanaryMod APIs in Java,
you can do using ScriptCraft in JavaScript.

# Description

ScriptCraft is a plugin for Minecraft Servers which lets operators,
administrators and plug-in authors customize the game using
JavaScript.  ScriptCraft makes it easier to create your own mods. Mods
can be written in Javscript and can use the full [SpigotMC
API][spigot] or [CanaryMod API][cm]. ScriptCraft works with all of the
following Minecraft Server software:

* [SpigotMC][spigot] (Recommended)
* [GlowStone][gs] 
* [CanaryMod][cm] 

[spigot]: http://www.spigotmc.org/
[gs]: http://www.glowstone.net/
[cm]: http://canarymod.net/

I recommend using SpigotMC because both CanaryMod and CraftBukkit are
no longer being actively developed. The ScriptCraft mod also lets you
enter javascript commands at the in-game prompt.  To bring up the
in-game prompt press the `/` key then type `js ` followed by any
javascript statement.  For example: `/js 1 + 1` will print 2.

ScriptCraft also includes many objects and functions to make building
and modding easier using JavaScript. The JavaScript `Drone` object
bundled with ScriptCraft provides an easy way to build at-scale in
Minecraft. See the attached [temple.js][temple] file for an example
of how you can use the sample Drone plugin to create new buildings in
Minecraft.

[cottage]: https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/tree/master/src/main/js/plugins/drone/contrib/cottage.js
[temple]: https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/src/main/js/plugins/drone/contrib/temple.js
[bukkit]: http://dl.bukkit.org/

# Prerequisites

ScriptCraft is a Minecraft Server Mod which only works with Minecraft
for Personal computers (Windows, Mac and Linux). It does not work with
X-BOX, Playstation or WiiU versions of the game. You will need to have
Java version 7 or later installed. Check the version by typing `java 
-version` at a command prompt.

# Installation

Before installing ScriptCraft you must first install SpigotMC which is
a special version of Minecraft Server that makes it easy to customize
the game.

## Installing and Running SpigotMC

Follow these steps to download and install SpigotMC.

1. Download Spigot's [BuildTools.jar][spigotdl] 
2. Save the BuildTools.jar file to a new directory called spigotmc.
3. Open a terminal (Mac and Linux) or command prompt (windows) window and type `java -jar BuildTools.jar`. This will kick off a long series of commands to ""build"" SpigotMC.
4. When the build is done, there will be a new file beginning with `spigot` and ending in `.jar` in the spigotmc directory. Run this file by typing `java -jar spigot-1.10.2.jar` (it might not be that exact name - you can list files in the directory by typing `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Mac and Linux).
5. The server will start up then shut down very shortly afterwards. You'll need to edit a file called `eula.txt` - change `eula=false` to `eula=true` and save the file.
6. Run the `java -jar spigot-1.10.2.jar` command again - this time the server will start up. Shut it down by typing `stop` at the server prompt.

## Installing ScriptCraft

Follow these steps to download and install ScriptCraft.

1. Download the [scriptcraft.jar][dl] plugin and save it to the `plugins` directory and restart the server by typing `java -jar spigot-1.10.2.jar`.
2. At the server prompt type `js 1 + 1` and hit enter. The result `2` should be displayed. 

Congratulations - you've just installed your Custom Minecraft Server and are ready to begin writing your first mod!

# Post Install

Once installed, a new scriptcraft/plugins directory is automatically
created.  All files in the scriptcraft/plugins directory will be
automatically loaded when the server starts.  *Only players who are
ops can use this plugin.* You can grant a player `op` privileges by
typing 'op <username>' (replacing <username> with your own Minecraft
user name) at the server console prompt or by adding the player's
username to the ops.txt file in your server directory.

Launch the server, then launch the Minecraft client and create a new
server connection. The IP address will be `localhost` . Once you've
connected to your server and have entered the game, look at a
ground-level block and type:

    /js up().box( blocks.wool.black, 4, 9, 1 )

&hellip; This will create a black monolith structure 4 blocks wide by 9
blocks high by 1 block long.  Take a look at the
src/main/javascript/drone/drone.js file to see what ScriptCraft's
drone can do.  

If you're interested in customizing minecraft beyond just creating new buildings, take a look at [the homes mod][homes] for an example of how to create a more fully-featured JavaScript plugin for Minecraft.

## Your first mod - Howling blocks
Listed below is a simple mod that will make blocks 'Howl' when they're broken. 

``` javascript
// copy and paste this code to a new file named 'scriptcraft/plugins/howling-blocks.js'
var sounds = require('sounds');
function howl(event){
  sounds.entityWolfHowl( event.block );
}
events.blockBreak( howl );
``` 

If you're using CanaryMod instead of SpigotMC you can [download the equivalent code](https://gist.github.com/walterhiggins/69cddd15160d803fb096).

A JavaScript mod for minecraft is just a JavaScript source file (.js)
located in the scriptcraft/plugins directory. All .js files in this
directory will be automatically loaded when the server starts. 

To get started writing your own mod, take a look at some of the
[examples][examples].

[homes]: src/main/js/plugins/homes/homes.js
[examples]: src/main/js/plugins/examples/

# Additional information

Because the SpigotMC API is open, all of the SpigotMC API is accessible
via javascript once the ScriptCraft plugin is loaded. There are a
couple of useful Java objects exposed via javascript in the
ScriptCraft plugin:

 * `__plugin` &ndash; the ScriptCraft Plugin itself. This is a useful
   starting point for accessing other SpigotMC objects. The `__plugin`
   object is of type [org.bukkit.plugin.Plugin][api] and all
   of its properties and methods are accessible. For example: `js
   __plugin.name` returns the plugin's name
   (JavaScript is more concise than the equivalent Java code:
   `__plugin.getName()` ).

 * `server` &ndash; The top-level org.bukkit.Server object. See the [SpigotMC API docs][spigotapi] for reference.

 * `self` &ndash; The player/command-block or server console operator who
   invoked the `/js` command. Again, this is a good jumping off point for
   diving into the SpigotMC API.

# Bukkit Configuration 
## (You can ignore this if using CanaryMod)

ScriptCraft works with Bukkit Plugin and uses the Bukkit Configuration
API. On first loading, ScriptCraft will create a config.yml file in
the plugins/scriptcraft/ directory. This file looks like this:

    extract-js:
      plugins: true
      modules: true
      lib: true

This file allows scriptcraft admins to turn on or off re-unzipping of the `modules`,
`plugins` and `lib` folders when deploying a new version of
ScriptCraft. It's strongly recommended that the `lib` directory always
be set to true to get the latest core ScriptCraft code . The modules
and plugins directories are optional and not part of ScriptCraft core.

## Quick Start
Too much text for you?  Click the `cdk` folder in the source above for a fast and relatively-automated walkthrough.

## Background

Instead of paying a minecraft hosting service for a private server for you and your friends, host it yourself. By utilizing several AWS services, a minecraft server can automatically start when you're ready to use it, and shut down when you are done. The final cost will depend on use but can be as little as a a dollar or two per month. The cost estimate breakdown is below.

This is a _reasonably_ cost effective solution for someone that doesn't need their server running 24/7. If that's you, read on!

## Workflow

The process works as follows:

1. Open Minecraft Multiplayer, let it look for our server, it will time out.
2. The DNS lookup query is logged in Route 53 on our public hosted zone.
3. CloudWatch forwards the query to a Lambda function.
4. The Lambda function modifies an existing ECS Fargate service to a desired task count of 1.
5. Fargate launches two containers, Minecraft and a watchdog, which updates the DNS record to the new IP
6. The watchdog optionally sends a text message through Twilio and/or publishes to an SNS topic when the server is ready.
7. Refresh Minecraft server list, server is ready to connect.
8. After 10 minutes without a connection or 20 minutes after the last client disconnects (customizable) the watchdog sets the desired task count to zero and shuts down.

## Diagram

![Basic Workflow](docs/diagrams/aws_architecture.drawio.png)

## Requirements

- AWS Account
- Domain name with public [DNS served from Route 53]. Does not need to be registered through Route 53.
- Minecraft Java edition OR Bedrock edition client
- Use of the excellent [Minecraft Java Docker] or [Minecraft Bedrock Docker] server image (used within task definition, no direct download required)

## Cost Breakdown

- Link to [AWS Estimate] assuming 20 hours a month usage.
- tl;dr : $0.50 per month for DNS zones, $0.0149 (one point five cents) per hour for Fargate Spot or $0.049 (four point nine cents) per hour for regular Fargate. All other costs negligible, a couple of pennies per month at most.
- tl;dr;tl;dt : $1.50 / month for 20 hours of play.

# Installation and Setup

For a quick start, a Cloud Deployment Kit (CDK) implementation is available! Click on the `cdk` folder in the source for the instructions. The documentation will be refined soon to expand on this to help novice users. What follows is a manual walkthrough that anyone should be able to complete.

## Checklist of things to keep track of

To simplify the procedure, your ECS cluster name, service name, and sns topic name need to be defined before you start. This is because we will be referencing them before they are created. In the documentation I use these:

- Cluster name : `minecraft`
- Service name : `minecraft-server`
- SNS Topic : `minecraft-notifications`

Things you need to go find because they'll be used in the procedure are:

- AWS Account ID. This is a 12 digit number (at least mine is). [Finding your AWS account ID]. Put this in the IAM policies where I've put `zzzzzzzzzzzz`
- Hosted Zone ID. This is a variable length string tied to your domain name in the Route 53 console.
- VPC IPv4 CIDR. It looks like (and very well may be) `172.31.0.0/16`. Find it by opening the VPC console, tapping on `Your VPCs` and looking in the `IPv4 CIDR` column.

Things you will locate as you go along and will need during IAM policy creation:

- EFS File System ID
- EFS Access Point ID

## Region Selection

While it doesn't matter which region you decide to run your server in, **Route 53 will only ship its logs to us-east-1**, which in turns means that the lambda function also has to be in us-east-1. This lambda function can fire off the server in another region without issue, as long as the destination region is specified within the lambda function code. For the purposes of this documentation, I'm using `us-west-2` to run my server.

Double check the region in anything you're copy/pasting.

## VPC

A VPC with Subnets must exist in order for Fargate tasks to launch and for EFS shares to be mounted. A subnet should exist in each availability zone so that Fargate (and Fargate Spot, if used) can properly launch the tasks in an AZ with plenty of capacity. A security group for our task is required but is easiest configured when setting up the Task Definition below.

A [Default VPC] should do the trick, chances are you've already got one. We'll be modifying the default security group within the EFS setup below.

## Elastic File System

EFS is where the world data and server properties are stored, and persists between runs of the minecraft server. By using an ""Access Point"" the mounted folder is created automatically, so no mounting of the EFS to an external resource is required to get up and running. To make changes to the files like `server.properties` later however, a user can either mount the EFS file system to a Linux host in their account if they're comfortable with that, or I detail another method below using AWS DataSync and S3 that anyone can use without Linux experience.

### Creating the EFS

Open the Elastic File System console and create a new file system. Believe it or not, all the defaults are fine here! It will create an EFS available in each subnet within your VPC.

Select your newly created filesystem, and tap the `Access Points` tab. Create a new access point using the following specifics:

- Details
  - Root directory path : `/minecraft`
- POSIX User
  - User ID : `1000`
  - Group ID : `1000`
- Root directory creation permissions (this is required, otherwise our container won't be able to create the folder to store its data the first time)
  - Owner user ID : `1000`
  - Owner group ID : `1000`
  - POSIX Permissions : `0755`

Click `Create access point`. Record the File System ID and the Access Point ID for our checklist. They are in the format `fs-xxxxxxxx` and `fsap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` respectively.

### Allow access to EFS from within the VPC

Our EFS by default is assigned the default security group, which allows connections from all members of that default security group. Our ECS Service will not be using the default security group however, because we are opening Minecraft to the public internet. So, we need to add EFS access to the default security group (more advanced users may want to create a new dedicated security group with this rule and assign it to the mount points within the EFS console, however that will not be described here).

Open the VPC console, find `Security Groups` on the left hand side. Select the default security group in the list, then click on `Edit inbound rules`. Add a new rule, select `NFS` in the `Type` list and put your VPC IPv4 CIDR from your checklist as the source. After clicking `Save rules` double check that it added successfully by viewing it in the `Security Groups` detail pane.

## Lambda

A lambda function must exist that turns on your minecraft service. We do this with a simple python function that change the ""Tasks Desired"" count from zero to one when it is invoked. We haven't created the ECS service yet, but that's okay, because we decided on the cluster name and service name before we started.

Because we are relying on Route 53+CloudWatch to invoke the Lambda function, it _must_ reside in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) region.

From the Lambda console, create a new function using `Author from scratch`. I've used Python 3.9 but the latest version available should be fine. Call it `minecraft-launcher`. The other defaults are fine, it will create an IAM role we will modify afterward. We do not need to specify a VPC.

Once the function has been created and you're in the code editor, replace the contents of the default lambda_function.py with this:

```python
import boto3

REGION = 'us-west-2'
CLUSTER = 'minecraft'
SERVICE = 'minecraft-server'


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """"""Updates the desired count for a service.""""""

    ecs = boto3.client('ecs', region_name=REGION)
    response = ecs.describe_services(
        cluster=CLUSTER,
        services=[SERVICE],
    )

    desired = response[""services""][0][""desiredCount""]

    if desired == 0:
        ecs.update_service(
            cluster=CLUSTER,
            service=SERVICE,
            desiredCount=1,
        )
        print(""Updated desiredCount to 1"")
    else:
        print(""desiredCount already at 1"")
```

This file is also in this repository in the `lambda` folder. Change the region, cluster, or service on lines 3-5 if needed. Then, click the `Deploy` button. Switch back to your server region now so that we don't create anything in the wrong region later.

Lambda can be very inexpensive when used sparingly. For example, this lambda function runs in about 1600ms when starting the container, and in about 500ms if the container is already online. This means, running at a 128MB memory allocation, it will cost $0.00000336 the first time the server is launched from an off state, and about $0.00000105 every time someone connects to an online server, because anyone connecting will have to perform a DNS lookup which will trigger your lambda function. If you and four friends played once a day for a month, it would come out to $0.0002583, which is 2.6% of a single penny.

## Route 53

Ensure that a domain name you own is set up in Route 53. If you don't own one, consider registering one. You can use Route 53 for convenience or go to one of the big domain providers. Either way, ensure you've got your nameservers set to host out of Route 53 as it's required for the on-demand functionality.

### Server DNS Record

Add an A record with a 30 second TTL with a unique name that you will use to connect to your minecraft server. Something like minecraft.yourdomainname.com, or more complex if desired, as every time anyone _in the world_ performs a DNS lookup on this name, your Minecraft server will launch. The value of the record is irrelevant because it will be updated every time our container launches. Use 1.1.1.1 or 192.168.1.1 for now if you can't think of anything. The low TTL is so that the DNS clients and non-authoritative DNS servers won't cache the record long and you can connect quicker after the IP updates.

### Query Logging

The magic that allows the on-demand idea to work without any ""always on"" infrastructure comes in here, with Query logging. Every time someone looks up a DNS record for your domain, it will hit Route 53 as the authoritative DNS server. These queries can be logged and actions performed from them.

From your hosted zone, click `Configure query logging` on the top right. Then, click `Grant Permission` so that it will apply appropriate policies for queries to be logged. Finally, in `Log group` select `Create log group` and use the suggested name with your domain name in the string, `/aws/route53/yourdomainname.com` and click `Create`.

## Optional SNS Notifications

You can receive a text or email or anything else you want to consume via Amazon SNS, if Twilio isn't your thing. This also allows this to be a 100% AWS solution.

From the SNS console, create a `Standard` topic called `minecraft-notifications`. Also at your convenience, create a Subscription to the topic to a destination of your choice. Email is easy and free, SMS is beyond the scope of this documentation but there's plenty of resources out there to help you set it up.

## IAM

The IAM Console is where we configure the roles and policies required to give access to the Task running the Minecraft server and the Lambda Function used to start it.

We will be creating four distinct policies and one role. The policies will then be attached to the appropriate roles.

### Policies

#### EFS Policy

This policy will allow for read/write access to our new Elastic File System Access Point. In the policy below, replace the zzz's with your account id and put your file system and access point id in the appropriate places. Change the region if necessary.

Call this policy `efs.rw.minecraft-data`

```json
{
  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
  ""Statement"": [
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": [
        ""elasticfilesystem:ClientMount"",
        ""elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite"",
        ""elasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems""
      ],
      ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-west-2:zzzzzzzzzzzz:file-system/fs-xxxxxxxx"",
      ""Condition"": {
        ""StringEquals"": {
          ""elasticfilesystem:AccessPointArn"": ""arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-west-2:zzzzzzzzzzzz:access-point/fsap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx""
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ECS Policy

This policy will allow for management of the Elastic Container Service tasks and service. This lets the Lambda function start the service, as well as allows the service to turn itself off when not in use. The `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces` section is so that the task can determine what IP address is assigned to it to properly update the DNS record.

Replace the `zzzzzzzzzzzz` below with the appriopriate account ID in your ARN. If you are not using the default cluster name or service name we decided above, change those as well. Change the region if necessary.

Call this policy `ecs.rw.minecraft-service`

```json
{
  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
  ""Statement"": [
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": [""ecs:*""],
      ""Resource"": [
        ""arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:zzzzzzzzzzzz:service/minecraft/minecraft-server"",
        ""arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:zzzzzzzzzzzz:task/minecraft/*""
      ]
    },
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": [""ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces""],
      ""Resource"": [""*""]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Route 53 Policy

This policy gives permission to our ECS task to update the DNS `A` record associated with our minecraft server. Note: This will give your container access to change _all_ records within the hosted zone, and this may not be desirable if you're using this domain for anything else outside of this purpose. If you'd like to increase security, you can create a subdomain zone of the main domain to limit the impact. This is an advanced use case and the setup is described pretty well within the answers to [Delegate Zone Setup].

Place the hosted zone identifier from our checklist and place it in the Resource line within this policy where the XXX's are.

Call this policy `route53.rw.yourdomainname`

```json
{
  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
  ""Statement"": [
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": [
        ""route53:GetHostedZone"",
        ""route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets"",
        ""route53:ListResourceRecordSets""
      ],
      ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX""
    },
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": [""route53:ListHostedZones""],
      ""Resource"": ""*""
    }
  ]
}
```

#### SNS policy (optional)

If you have decided to receive SNS notifications, we need a policy that allows publishing to the SNS topic you created.

Replace the zzz's with your account ID, and adjust the topic name or the region if you used something different.

Call this policy `sns.publish.minecraft-notifications`

```json
{
  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
  ""Statement"": [
    {
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
      ""Action"": ""sns:Publish"",
      ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:zzzzzzzzzzzz:minecraft-notifications""
    }
  ]
}
```

### Roles

Policies are assigned to roles, and roles are used by services to services to perform the required tasks. We are creating one new role and adjusting an existing role.

#### ECS Role

In the IAM console, select `Roles` and `Create role`. In the wizard, in the first ""Choose your use case"" dialog click `Elastic Container Service` and then for ""Select your use case"", click `Elastic Container Service Task` (last one in the list). Click `Next: Permissions`.

In the policy list, you can click `Filter policies` and select `Customer managed` to make this easier. Check the boxes for all of our created policies:

- `efs.rw.minecraft-data`
- `ecs.rw.minecraft-service`
- `route53.rw.yourdomainname`
- `sns.publish.minecraft-notifications`

Click `Next: Tags` then `Next: Review`. Call the role `ecs.task.minecraft-server` and click `Create role`.

#### Lambda Role

In the roles list, find the role created by the lambda function earlier. It will be called `minecraft-launcher-role-xxxxxxxx`. Click on it, then click `Attach policies`. Give it the `ecs.rw.minecraft-service` policy we created earlier.

## Elastic Container Service

The final task we need to do is create the ECS task, cluster, and service.

### Task Definition

Create a new Task Definition of `FARGATE` launch type. In the configuration wizard, use these options:

- Task Definition Name: `minecraft-server`
- Task Role: `ecs.task.minecraft-server`
- Network Mode: `awsvpc` (default)
- Task Execution Role: `Create new role` (default if you've never created tasks before) or `ecsTaskExecutionRole` (default otherwise). Not to be confused with the `ecs.task.minecraft-server` role we used earlier.
- Task Memory: `2GB` (good to start, increase later if needed)
- Task CPU: `1 vCPU` (good to start, increase later if needed)

Skip `Container Definitions` temporarily and scroll further down to Volumes. Click `Add volume`, call it `data`, volume type EFS. Select the filesystem id from the dropdown that we created above, the access point id we created above, and check the box for `Encryption in transit` and click Add.

Scroll back up and click `Add container`. Use defaults except for these specifics:

- Container name: `minecraft-server`
- Image:
  - For Java edition: `itzg/minecraft-server`
  - For Bedrock edition: `itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server`
- Port Mappings:
  - For Java edition: `25565 TCP`
  - For Bedrock edition: `19132 UDP`

Under `Advanced container configuration` make these changes:

- Environment
  - UNCHECK `Essential` (the watchdog container handles shutdowns)
  - Environment Variables. One gotcha, you have to select ""Value"" from the drop down list when defining these.
    - `EULA` : `TRUE`
    - Any additional stuff you want from [Minecraft Java Docker Server Docs] or [Minecraft Bedrock Docker Server Docs]
- Storage and Logging
  - Mount Points
    - Source volume : `data`
    - Container path: `/data`

Click `Add` and then click `Add container` again to add a second container to the list. Use defaults except for these specifics:

- Container name: `minecraft-ecsfargate-watchdog`
- Image: `doctorray/minecraft-ecsfargate-watchdog` (source for this container within this project if you want to build/host it yourself)

Under `Advanced container configuration` make these changes:

- Essential: YES checked (default)
- Environmental Variables (required)
  - `CLUSTER` : `minecraft`
  - `SERVICE` : `minecraft-server`
  - `DNSZONE` : Route 53 hosted zone ID from your checklist
  - `SERVERNAME` : `minecraft.yourdomainname.com`
- Environmental Variables (optional)
  - `STARTUPMIN` : Number of minutes to wait for a connection after starting before terminating (default 10)
  - `SHUTDOWNMIN` : Number of minutes to wait after the last client disconnects before terminating (default 20)
  - `SNSTOPIC` : Full ARN of your SNS topic (if using SNS)
  - `TWILIOFROM` : `+1XXXYYYZZZZ` (your twilio number)
  - `TWILIOTO` : `+1XXXYYYZZZZ` (your cell phone to get a text on)
  - `TWILIOAID` : Twilio account ID
  - `TWILIOAUTH` : Twilio auth code

If using Twilio to alert you when the server is ready and when it turns off, all four twilio variables must be specified. If publishing to an SNS topic, the `SNSTOPIC` variable must be specified.

Click `Add` and then `Create` to create the task.

### Cluster

Create a new ""Networking Only"" Cluster. Call it `minecraft`. Don't create a dedicated VPC for this, use the default or same one you already created your EFS in. Enabling Container Insights is optional but recommended for troubleshooting later, especially if you expect a lot of people to potentially connect and you want to review CPU or Memory usage.

### Service

Within your `minecraft` cluster, create a new Service.

- Configure serivce
  - Launch type: Click `Switch to capacity provider`
  - Capacity provider strategy: `Custom strategy`
  - Click `Add another provider`
  - Provider 1: You've got a choice, details in next paragraph
    - `FARGATE`: 4.9 cents per hour of use with this CPU/Memory configuration
    - `FARGATE_SPOT`: 1.49 cents per hour of use with this CPU/Memory configuration
  - Task Definition
    - Family: `minecraft-server`
    - Revision: The latest version (Don't forget to update it here if you revise your task definition later)
  - Platform version: `LATEST`
  - Cluster: `minecraft`
  - Service name: `minecraft-server` (The service name from our checklist)
  - Number of tasks: `0` (The DNS+Lambda pipeline will change this to 1 on demand)

`FARGATE_SPOT` is significantly cheaper but AWS can terminate your instance at any time if they need the capacity. The watchdog is designed to intercept this termination command and shut down safely, so it's fine to use Spot to save a few pennies, at the extremely low risk of game interruption.

Click `Next step`

- Configure Network
  - Cluster VPC: The VPC that your EFS is in (you probably only have one anyway)
  - Subnets: Pick ALL of them, one at a time (must match the Subnets that EFS was created in, which by default is all of them)
  - Security Group: Click `Edit`
    - Create new security gruop
    - Security group name: Default is fine or call it `minecraft-server`
    - Inbound rules for security group (Java edition)
      - Change `HTTP` to `Custom TCP`
      - Port range: `25565`
      - Source: `Anywhere` is fine. Customizing this to specific source IPs is beyond the scope of this document.
      - Click `Save`
    - Inbound rules for security group (Bedrock edition)
      - Change `HTTP` to `Custom UDP`
      - Port range: `19132`
      - Source: `Anywhere` is fine. Customizing this to specific source IPs is beyond the scope of this document.
      - Click `Save`
    - Auto-assign public IP: `ENABLED` (default)

Tap `Next`, `Next`, and `Create Service`.

## CloudWatch

The final step to link everything together is to configure CloudWatch to start your server when you try to connect to it.

Open the CloudWatch console and change to the `us-east-1` region. Go to `Logs` -> `Log groups` -> and find the `/aws/route53/yourdomainname.com` Log group that we created in the Route 53 Query Log Configuration. Optionally, modify the retention period to delete the logs after a few days so they don't accumulate forever.

Go to the `Subscription filters` tab, click `Create` and then `Create Lambda subscription filter`.

In the `Create Lambda subscription filter` page, use the following values:

- Lambda Function : `minecraft-launcher`
- Log format : `Other`
- Subscription filter pattern: `""minecraft.yourdomainname.com""` (or just simply `minecraft` -- this is what it's looking for to fire off the lambda)
- Subscription filter name: `minecraft`

Click `Start streaming`.

# Usage and Customization

Launch your server the first time by visiting your server name in a web browser, which won't load anything but it will trigger the actions. You can watch it start up by refreshing the ECS console page within your `minecraft` cluster. Watch the `Desired tasks` change from 0 to 1, then on the `Tasks` tab select our task and refresh until both containers say `RUNNING`. You can also go to the `Logs` tab here and refresh the container logs to see the output of the initial world creation, etc.

To use your new server, open Minecraft Multiplayer, add your new server, and join. It will fail at first if the server is not started, but then everything comes online and you can join your new world! You may notice that you don't have many permissions or ability to customize a lot of things yet, so let's dig into how to edit the relevant files!

## Option 1: Mount EFS Directly

This option is the easiest for folks that are comfortable in the Linux command line, so I'm not going to step-by-step it. But basically, launch an AWS Linux v2 AMI in EC2 with bare-minimum specs, log into it, mount the EFS Access Point, and use your favorite command line text editor to change around server.properties, the ops.json, whitelists, whatever, and then re-launch your server with the new configuration.

## Option 2: DataSync and S3

Since EFS doesn't have a convenient way to access the files outside of mounting a share to something within the VPC, we can utilize AWS DataSync to copy files in and out to a more convenient location. These instructions will use S3 as there are countless S3 clients out there you can manage files, including the AWS Console itself.

### Step 1: Create an S3 bucket

Open the S3 console and create a bucket. It must have a unique name (across ALL s3 buckets). `yourdomainname-files` works pretty well. Place it in the same region as your EFS share. I always like to enable Bucket Versioning, in case you need to reference old files or restore to a different version. Also enable Server Side Encryption (why isn't this on by default?).

### Step 2: Create an EFS -> S3 DataSync Task

Open the DataSync console and click `Create task`.

For `Source location options`, select `Create new location` with these options:

- Location type : `Amazon EFS file system`
- Region : The region your EFS is in
- EFS File System : The file system you created earlier (this is the file system itself not the access point)
- Mount path : `/minecraft` or wherever your Access Point is pointed to

Click `Next`. For `Destination location options` select `Create new location` with these options:

- Location type : `Amazon S3`
- Region : The region your bucket was created in
- S3 bucket : The bucket you created earlier
- S3 storage class : `Standard` is fine, these are really small files.
- Folder : `/minecraft`
- IAM Role : Click `Autogenerate` and it will fill this in for you.

Click `Next`. For `Task Name` consider something like `minecraft-efs-to-s3`. For the rest of the options, use these:

- Task execution configuration : Use all defaults
- Data transfer configuration
  - Data to scan : Specific files and folders (Or pick the entire location if you don't want to specify each file below)
  - Transfer mode : Transfer only data that has changed
  - Keep deleted files / Overwrite files : Keep enabled as default
  - Includes for Java edition: add three:
    - `banned-ips.json`
    - `banned-players.json`
    - `ops.json`
    - `usercache.json`
    - `whitelist.json`
    - `server.properties`
    - `server-icon.png`
  - Includes for Bedrock edition:
    - `permissions.json`
    - `whitelist.json`
    - `server.properties`
- Schedule : not scheduled, we'll run it on demand
- Task logging
  - Log level : Do not send logs to CloudWatch

Click `Next` and `Create task`.

### Step 3: Create an S3 -> EFS DataSync Task

Open the DataSync console and click `Create task`.

For `Source location options`, select `Choose an existing location` with these options:

- Region : The region your S3 bucket is in
- Existing locations : The S3 location you created in the previous step

Click `Next`. For `Destination location options` select `Choose an existing location` with these options:

- Region : The region your EFS is in
- Existing locations: The EFS location you created in the previous step

Click `Next`. For `Task Name` consider something like `minecraft-s3-to-efs`. For the rest of the options, use these:

- Task execution configuration : Use all defaults
- Data transfer configuration
  - Data to scan : Entire source location
  - Transfer mode : Transfer only data that has changed
  - Keep deleted files / Overwrite files : Keep enabled as default
  - Excludes : None necessary this time around
  - Advanced : UNCHECK ""Copy Ownership"" and ""Copy Permissions"" -- otherwise it will change/lose them under certain circumstances and you won't be able to play after changes
- Schedule : not scheduled, we'll run it on demand
- Task logging
  - Log level : Do not send logs to CloudWatch

Click `Next` and `Create task`.

### Usage and file editing

After you've launched the minecraft server successfully once, it will create files in EFS such as `server.properties`, `ops.json`, `whitelist.json` among others. From the DataSync console, you can launch the `minecraft-efs-to-s3` task, which will copy these files from the EFS share to your S3 bucket. Then you can download these files from S3 (using the console or something like [S3 Browser]), edit them on your computer, then use the same client to upload the files back to S3. Afterward, open DataSync and launch the `minecraft-s3-to-efs` task to copy the updated files back to your EFS share. Then when you launch the server again, it will see and use the new files.

Best practice would be, any time you want to make a change to always copy the latest files from EFS to S3 first while your server is off before editing them and copying them back. Otherwise you may unintentionally regress some settings.

# Testing and Troubleshooting

The easiest way to trigger your process is to perform a dns lookup, which you can simply do by trying to visit your server name in a web browser. It will fail (duh) but it will also trigger your server to start up.

## Areas of concern, what to watch

### CloudWatch

Are your DNS queries getting logged properly? Check in the log groups, hit refresh. Often takes up to 30 seconds for them to show up.

### Lambda

Is your function running? We didn't design a ""test"" functionality for it but you could!

### Elastic Container Service

Can you start your server manually by setting desired count to 1? Here's some possible jumping off points for issues:

#### Service won't launch task

Check the execution roles, and that they have the right permissions. Check the container names for typos. Check that you selected multiple subnets in the task definition, and that it's using the LATEST version. If you updated the task definition, did you update the Service to use the new task definition version?

#### Containers won't switch to RUNNING state

Check all of the above, but also ensure you're using an EFS Access Point with the specified auto-create permissions. The minecraft container will fail if it can't mount the data volume.

### Can't connect to minecraft server

Refresh. Wait a minute, especially the first launch. Check ECS to see that the containers are in the RUNNING state. Open the running task, go to the logs tab, select minecraft and see if there are any errors on the logs. Did you make sure you opened the right port (25565 TCP) to the world in the task security group?? Security groups can be edited from both the VPC and the EC2 console.

### Not getting text messages

Are your Twilio vars valid? Do you have sufficient funds on your Twilio account? Check the logs on the watchdog container for any curl errors.

## Server starts randomly?

Remember, the server starts with a DNS query automatically. So, if you've got buddies you've shared the server with, it may start up if they open their multiplayer screen to play on a different server if yours is in the list! If this is an issue, it could probably be mitigated with a more advanced CloudWatch Subscription Filter that checks against the source IP address in addition to just the domain name, with it limiting to your ISP or location.

# Other Stuff

## Concerned about cost overruns?

Set up a [Billing Alert]! You can get an email if your bill exceeds a certain amount. Set it at $5 maybe?

## Twilio setup / usage

Open a free account at [Twilio], and load it up with $10 or so of credit. You can purchase a phone number here for a small monthly fee, and pay per use text messaging. Doing this will allow the container to send you a text message when the server is available for use.

30,Ahtenus/minecraft-init,Shell,"Init script for minecraft/bukkit servers
=======================================
A init script that apart from starting and stopping the server correctly also has some extra features
for running a mincraft/craftbukkit server.

Features
--------

 * Utilization of ramdisk for world data, decreases lag when getting world chunks
 * Cleaning of server.log, a big log file slows down the server
 * Backup for worlds
 * Server updating and complete backup
 * Exclude files and directories from full backup by adding them to ""exclude.list""

Requirements
------------
screen, rsync

Access server console
=====================

	screen -r minecraft

Exit the console
	
	Ctrl+A D

Setup
=====

1. Symlink the minecraft file to `/etc/init.d/minecraft`, set the required premissions and update rc.d.

		sudo ln -s ~/minecraft-init/minecraft /etc/init.d/minecraft
		chmod 755  ~/minecraft-init/minecraft
		sudo update-rc.d minecraft defaults

2. Edit the variables in `config.example` to your needs and rename it to `config` (leaving it in the same folder as the original minecraft script)

3. Move your worlds to the folder specified by `WORLDSTORAGE`

4. Edit crontab

	As the server user:
	
		crontab -e

	Add these lines:

		#m 	h 	dom	mon	dow	command

MCLC (Minecraft Launcher Core) is a NodeJS solution for launching modded and vanilla Minecraft without having to download and format everything yourself.
Basically a core for your Electron or script based launchers.

### Getting support
Since people seem to use this, I've created a Discord server for anyone who needs to get in contact with me or get help!

### Installing

`npm i minecraft-launcher-core`

### Standard Example
```javascript
const { Client, Authenticator } = require('minecraft-launcher-core');
const launcher = new Client();

let opts = {
    clientPackage: null,
    // For production launchers, I recommend not passing 
    // the getAuth function through the authorization field and instead
    // handling authentication outside before you initialize
    // MCLC so you can handle auth based errors and validation!
    authorization: Authenticator.getAuth(""username"", ""password""),
    root: ""./minecraft"",
    version: {
        number: ""1.14"",
        type: ""release""
    },
    memory: {
        max: ""6G"",
        min: ""4G""
    }
}

launcher.launch(opts);

launcher.on('debug', (e) => console.log(e));
launcher.on('data', (e) => console.log(e));
```

#### Notes
##### Custom
If you are loading up a client outside of vanilla Minecraft or Forge (Optifine and for an example), you'll need to download the needed files yourself if you don't provide downloads url downloads like Forge and Fabric. If no version jar is specified, MCLC will default back to the normal MC jar so mods like Fabric work.
##### Installer
This runs an executable with specified launch arguments. Was used to support Forge 1.13 before ForgeWrapper.
##### Authentication
MCLC's authenticator module does not support Microsoft authentication. You will need to use a library like [MSMC](https://github.com/Hanro50/MSMC). If you want to create your own solution, the following is the authorization JSON object format.
```js
{
    access_token: '',
    client_token: '',
    uuid: '',
    name: '',
    user_properties: '{}',
    meta: {
        type: 'mojang' || 'msa',
        demo: true || false, // Demo can also be specified by adding 'is_demo_user' to the options.feature array 
        // properties only exists for specific Minecraft versions.
        xuid: '',
        clientId: ''
    }
}
```

## Quickstart

The following starts a Bedrock Dedicated Server running a default version and
exposing the default UDP port: 

```bash
docker run -d -it -e EULA=TRUE -p 19132:19132/udp itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server
```

> **NOTE**: if you plan on running a server for a longer amount of time it is highly recommended using a management layer such as [Docker Compose](#deploying-with-docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](#deploying-with-kubernetes) to allow for incremental reconfiguration and image upgrades.

## Upgrading to the latest Bedrock server version

With the `VERSION` variable set to `LATEST`, which is the default, then the Bedrock server can be upgraded by restarting the container. At every startup, the container checks for the latest version and upgrades, if needed.

## Looking for a Java Edition Server

For Minecraft Java Edition you'll need to use this image instead:

[itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server)

## Environment Variables

### Container Specific

- `EULA` (no default) : must be set to `TRUE` to 
  accept the [Minecraft End User License Agreement](https://minecraft.net/terms)
- `VERSION` (`LATEST`) : can be set to a specific server version or the following special values can be used:
  - `LATEST` : determines the latest version and can be used to auto-upgrade on container start
  - `PREVIOUS` : uses the previously maintained major version. Useful when the mobile app is gradually being upgraded across devices
  - `1.11` : the latest version of 1.11
  - `1.12` : the latest version of 1.12
  - `1.13` : the latest version of 1.13
  - `1.14` : the latest version of 1.14
  - `1.16` : the latest version of 1.16
  - otherwise any specific server version can be provided to allow for temporary bug avoidance, etc
- `UID` (default derived from `/data` owner) : can be set to a specific user ID to run the
  bedrock server process
- `GID` (default derived from `/data` owner) : can be set to a specific group ID to run the
  bedrock server process
- `PACKAGE_BACKUP_KEEP` (`2`) : how many package backups to keep

### Server Properties

The following environment variables will set the equivalent property in `server.properties`, where each [is described here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#Bedrock_Edition_3).

- `SERVER_NAME`
- `SERVER_PORT`
- `SERVER_PORT_V6`
- `GAMEMODE`
- `DIFFICULTY`
- `LEVEL_TYPE`
- `ALLOW_CHEATS`
- `MAX_PLAYERS`
- `ONLINE_MODE`
- `WHITE_LIST`
- `VIEW_DISTANCE`
- `TICK_DISTANCE`
- `PLAYER_IDLE_TIMEOUT`
- `MAX_THREADS`
- `LEVEL_NAME`
- `LEVEL_SEED`
- `DEFAULT_PLAYER_PERMISSION_LEVEL`
- `TEXTUREPACK_REQUIRED`
- `SERVER_AUTHORITATIVE_MOVEMENT`
- `PLAYER_MOVEMENT_SCORE_THRESHOLD`
- `PLAYER_MOVEMENT_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD`
- `PLAYER_MOVEMENT_DURATION_THRESHOLD_IN_MS`
- `CORRECT_PLAYER_MOVEMENT`

For example, to configure a flat, creative server instead of the default use:

```bash
docker run -d -it --name bds-flat-creative \
  -e EULA=TRUE -e LEVEL_TYPE=flat -e GAMEMODE=creative \
  -p 19132:19132/udp itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server
```

## Exposed Ports

- **UDP** 19132 : the Bedrock server port. 
  **NOTE** that you must append `/udp` when exposing the port, such as `-p 19132:19132/udp`
  
## Volumes

- `/data` : the location where the downloaded server is expanded and ran. Also contains the
  configuration properties file `server.properties`

You can create a `named volume` and use it as:

```shell
docker volume create mc-volume
docker run -d -it --name mc-server -e EULA=TRUE -p 19132:19132/udp -v mc-volume:/data itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server
```

If you're using a named volume and want the bedrock process to run as a non-root user then you will need to pre-create the volume and `chown` it to the desired user.

For example, if you want the bedrock server to run with user ID 1000 and group ID 1000, then create and chown the volume named ""bedrock"" using:

```shell script
docker run --rm -v bedrock:/data alpine chown 1000:1000 /data
```

If using `docker run` then simply reference that volume ""bedrock"" in the `-v` argument. If using a compose file, declare the volume as an external using this type of declaration:

```yaml
volumes:
  bedrock:
    external:
      name: bedrock
```

## Connecting

When running the container on your LAN, you can find and connect to the dedicated server
in the ""LAN Games"" part of the ""Friends"" tab, such as:

![](docs/example-client.jpg)

## Permissions

The Bedrock Dedicated Server requires permissions be defined with XUIDs. There are various tools to look these up online and they
are also printed to the log when a player joins. There are 3 levels of permissions and 3 options to configure each group:

- `OPS` is used to define operators on the server.  
```shell
-e OPS ""1234567890,0987654321""
```
- `MEMBERS` is used to define the members on the server.
```shell
-e MEMBERS ""1234567890,0987654321""
```
- `VISITORS` is used to define visitors on the server.
```shell
-e VISITORS ""1234567890,0987654321""
```

## Whitelist

There are two ways to handle a whitelist. The first is to set the `WHITE_LIST` environment variable to true and map in [a whitelist.json](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Whitelist.json) that is custom-crafted to the container. The other is to use the `WHITE_LIST_USERS` environment variable to list users that should be whitelisted. This list is player names. The server will look up the names and add in the XUID to match the player.

```shell
-e WHITE_LIST_USERS=""player1,player2,player3""
```

> Starting with 1.16.230.50, `ALLOW_LIST`, `ALLOW_LIST_USERS`, and the file `allowlist.json` will be used instead.

## Mods Addons 

Also known as behavior or resource packs, in order to add mods into your server you can follow these steps, tested with [OPS (One Player Sleep)](https://foxynotail.com/addons/ops/) and [bedrocktweaks](https://bedrocktweaks.net/resource-packs/)

1. Install the mcpack or mcaddon on the client side first, just to make it easier to copy the files to the server, for Windows 10 files should be located on `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_*\LocalState\games\com.mojang`.
2. Copy over the folders of the mods from either behavior_packs or resource_packs into the server's volume.
> If you want to install them without using a client you should be able to unzip the mods directly into the server's volume, .mcaddon should go into behavior_packs and .mcpack into resource_packs. Both .mcaddon and .mcpack are actually renamed .zip files.
3. On the server's volume we will need to edit `valid_known_packs.json`, you can just copy and paste the definition of another pack and replace path, uuid and version with the mod being installed, uuid and version can be found on the mod behavior or resource _packs/mod/manifest.json, path is the path to the mod's folder.
```
	{
		""file_system"" : ""RawPath"",
		""path"" : ""behavior_packs/Foxy'sOneP"",
		""uuid"" : ""5f51f7b7-85dc-44da-a3ef-a48d8414e4d5"",
		""version"" : ""3.0.0""
	}
```
4. Lastly create on the server's volume `worlds/$level-name/world_behavior_packs.json`, you'll need to add an entry for each mod like on the previous manifest.json, we only need the uuid now called pack_id and the version replacing dots with commas and double quotes with [ ].
> You can also create a `worlds/$level-name/world_resource_packs.json` but I have seen that putting both resource and behavior packs inside the same json works just fine
```
[
	{
		""pack_id"" : ""5f51f7b7-85dc-44da-a3ef-a48d8414e4d5"",
		""version"" : [ 3, 0, 0 ]
	}
]
```
5. Restart the server and the mods should be enabled now! when connecting you will get a prompt asking if you want to ""Download & Join"" or just ""Join"", You need to Download & Join if you want to actually see the new resource pack added to the server.
This prompt is exclusive to resource packs as these alter how minecraft looks while behavior packs alter how minecraft functions and don't need to be downloaded or installed on the client side.
> If you want to force the resource pack on all clients, there's an option `texturepack-required=false` in `server.properties` that should be changed to `true`.
> Resource packs can be deleted by going into Settings > Storage > Cached Data, then selecting the pack and clicking on the trash can.

For more information [FoxyNoTail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBM4UFm0rQ&t=1380s) did a video explaining the same on a server running on Windows.

For more information about managing Bedrock Dedicated Servers in general, [check out this Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/user/ProfessorValko/comments/9f438p/bedrock_dedicated_server_tutorial/).

## Executing server commands

Assuming you started container with stdin and tty enabled (such as using `-it`), you can attach to the container's console by its name or ID using:

```shell script
docker attach CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
``` 

While attached, you can execute any server-side commands, such as op'ing your player to be admin:

```
op YOUR_XBOX_USERNAME
```

When finished, detach from the server console using Ctrl-p, Ctrl-q

## Deploying with Docker Compose

The [examples](examples) directory contains [an example Docker compose file](examples/docker-compose.yml) that declares:
- a service running the bedrock server container and exposing UDP port 19132
- a volume to be attached to the service

The service configuration includes some examples of configuring the server properties via environment variables:
```yaml
environment:
  EULA: ""TRUE""
  GAMEMODE: survival
  DIFFICULTY: normal
```

From with in the `examples` directory, you can deploy the composition by using:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can follow the logs using:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f bds
```

## Deploying with Kubernetes

The [examples](examples) directory contains [an example Kubernetes manifest file](examples/kubernetes.yml) that declares:
- a peristent volume claim (using default storage class)
- a pod deployment that uses the declared PVC
- a service of type LoadBalancer

The pod deployment includes some examples of configuring the server properties via environment variables:
```yaml
env:
- name: EULA
  value: ""TRUE""
- name: GAMEMODE
  value: survival
- name: DIFFICULTY
  value: normal
```

The file is deploy-able as-is on most clusters, but has been confirmed on [Docker for Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/kubernetes/) and [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/):

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kubernetes.yml
```

You can follow the logs of the deployment using:

```bash
kubectl logs -f deployment/bds
```

# Minecraft HDL 
 
Minecraft HDL is a digital synthesis flow for minecraft redstone circuits. It is an attempt to use industry standard design tools and methods to generate digital circuits with redstone. 
 
### Example: 
 
 
This file `multiplexer4_1.v` is a 6 input - 1 output circuit that selects one of the first 4 inputs (a, b, c, d) as the output based on the value of the last 2 inputs (x, y) 
 
```verilog 
module multiplexer4_1 ( a ,b ,c ,d ,x ,y ,dout ); 
 
output dout ; 
input a, b, c, d, x, y; 
 
assign dout = (a & (~x) & (~y)) | 
     (b & (~x) & (y)) |  
     (c & x & (~y)) | 
     (d & x & y); 
endmodule 
``` 
 
When synthesized through Minecraft HDL it produces this circuit: 
 
 
![4to1mux][mux4_short] 
 
 
With the 6 inputs on the right and the single output on the left

# About 

![MHDL_FLOW][flow]

MinecraftHDL was the final undergraduate design project made by three students in the Electrical, Computer & Software Engineering department at McGill University.  
 
It is by no means bug-free or even complete; It produces objectively inferior circuits to 'hand-made' redstone designs, and is not intended to be used in modded survival. It can generate almost any verilog circuit, however only simple designs will actually be testable in-game since any moderately-complex design will end up being longer than the maximum number of blocks loaded in Minecraft. 

Additionally, we are currently unable to synthesize sequential circuits, aka any circuits with a loopback or feedback. That means no memory, no counters or any circuit that could hold a state.
 
MinecraftHDL is an educational tool to illustrate on a macro-scopic scale how microelectronic digital circuits are designed and produced. It is a great way to introduce younger audiences to the world of digital design and can also be used to illustrate the difference between software and hardware design to undergraduate engineers taking their first RTL class.

 To show how easy it is to make a circuit with MinecraftHDL here is a gif of me creating a circuit, synthesizing, and generating it in minecraft in less than a minute!

The circuit I generate above is a 2bit adder. It takes two numbers of two bits and adds them. At the end of the gif I set both input numbers to '11' which is the binary representation of the number 3. Then I move to the output and we see that O3=1, O2=1, and O1=0, this gives the binary number '110' which is indeed 6.

## For Developers

### Compiling MineColonies

IMPORTANT: Please report any issues you have, as there might be some problems with the documentation! Also make sure you know EXACTLY what you're doing! It's not our fault if your OS crashes, becomes corrupted, etc.

#### Setup Java
The Java JDK is used to compile MineColonies.

1. Download and install the Java JDK 8.
    * [Windows](https://adoptopenjdk.net/): Choose OpenJDK 8 (LTS) version and HotSpot JVM, then click the `latest release` button. After the download is complete, open the file, accept the license agreement, and in a custom setup make sure that `Add to Path` and `Set JAVA_HOME` are set to `Entire feature will be installed on your local hard drive`. Then choose `Install` and wait for the installation to finish.
    * Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
		* Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/openjdk-bin:8`
		* Archlinux: `pacman -S jdk8-openjdk`
		* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk`
		* Fedora: `yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk`
2. Open up your command line and run `javac`. If it spews out a bunch of possible options and the usage, you're good to go. If not, try the steps again.

**Troubleshooting**
If the `javac` command does not work on Windows:
* Go to `Control Panel\System and Security\System` and click on `Advanced System Settings` on the left-hand side.
* Click on `Environment Variables`.
* Under `System Variables`, click `New`.
* For `Variable Name`, input `JAVA_HOME`.
* For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45` exactly as shown (or wherever your Java JDK installation is) and click `OK`.
* Scroll down to a variable named `Path` and double-click on it.
* Append `;%JAVA_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `OK`. Make sure the location is correct; double-check to make sure.

#### Setup Gradle (Optional)
Gradle is used to execute the various build tasks when compiling MineColonies.

1. Download and install Gradle.
	* [Windows/Mac download link](http://www.gradle.org/downloads). You only need the binaries, but choose whatever flavor you want.
		* Unzip the package and put it wherever you want, for example, `C:\Gradle`.
	* Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.gradle.org/downloads).
		* Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/gradle-bin`
		* Archlinux: You'll have to install it from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gradle).
		* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install gradle`
		* Fedora: Install Gradle manually from its website (see above), as Fedora ships a ""broken"" version of Gradle. Use `yum install gradle` only if you know what you're doing.
2. Windows: Set environment variables for Gradle.
	* Go back to `Environment Variables` and then create a new system variable.
	* For `Variable Name`, input `GRADLE_HOME`.
	* For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Gradle-3.0` exactly as shown (or wherever your Gradle installation is), and click `Ok`.
	* Scroll down to `Path` again, and append `;%GRADLE_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `Ok`. Once again, double-check the location.
3. Open up your command line and run `gradle`. If it says 'Welcome to Gradle [version].', then you're good to go. If not, try the steps again.

#### Setup Git
Git is used to clone MineColonies and update your local copy.

1. Download and install Git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/).
2. *Optional*: Download and install a Git GUI client, such as Gitkraken, SourceTree, GitHub for Windows/Mac, SmartGitHg, TortoiseGit, etc. A nice list is available [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

#### Setup MineColonies (Command Line)
This section assumes that you're using the command line version of Git.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to a place where you want to download the MineColonies source (e.g., `C:\GitHub\MineColonies\`) by executing `cd [folder location]`. This location is known as `basefolder` from now on.
3. Execute `git clone https://github.com/Minecolonies/minecolonies.git`. This will download MineColonies' source into `basefolder`.
4. Right now, you should have a directory that looks something like this:

***
    basefolder
	\-MineColonies
		\-MineColonies' files (should have `build.gradle`)
***

#### Setup MineColonies (GitKraken)
If you decide to go with a GUI client like GitKraken:

1. Open GitKraken
2. Click `File → Clone Repo`
3. Select GitHub.com and choose a base folder to clone to.
4. Write MineColonies in the ""Repository to Clone"" and select the one by ldtteam.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jVTXyCJ.png)

5. Click 'Clone the Repo'.

#### Compile MineColonies (Command Line)
1. Navigate to the MineColonies folder and run a `dir` to make sure the `build.gradle` file is where you expect it to be.
2. Execute `gradlew build`. This first sets up Forge and downloads the necessary libraries to build MineColonies. Be patient, as this may take a while.
    * If you did everything right, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` will be displayed after it finishes.
    * If you see `BUILD FAILED`, check the error output (it should be right around `BUILD FAILED`), fix everything (if possible), and try again.
3. Go to `basefolder\MineColonies\build\libs`.
    * You should see a `.jar` file named `MineColonies-universal-null.jar`.
4. Copy the jar into your Minecraft `mods` folder, and you are done! (`~/.minecraft/mods` on Linux)
5. Alternatively, you can also run `./gradlew runClient` to start Minecraft with this jar.

#### Compile MineColonies (Intellij)
1. Right-click the `build.gradle` file (or the background of the folder it's in) and select `Open Folder as Intellij Project`.
2. Select `Auto Import` and make sure a valid Gradle and JVM are selected.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ewccjDZ.png)

3. This will prepare some of the libraries used by Forge.
4. Click `View → Tool Windows → Gradle`.
5. In the Gradle view, expand the options to `Tasks → fg_runs`.
6. Click the small refresh symbol in the upper left of the Gradle view. This sets up Forge and downloads the necessary libraries to build MineColonies. 
7. Execute `genIntellijRuns` and restart Intellij.
8. You will see a runClient and runServer startup configuration in the dropdown at the top right next to the green ""run"" button. Select one and press ""run"".
9. If it doesn't start and throws a lot of errors, try another refresh. This often does wonders.
10. If you want to produce a running jar, execute the `build` task. This will result in a runnable jar file in `basefolder\MineColonies\build\libs`.

##### Troubleshooting
If Gradle synchronization fails, make sure:
1. `File → Project structure → Project → Project SDK` is set to your installed JDK version.
2. `File → Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → Build Tools → Gradle → Gradle JVM` is set to your installed JDK version.

#### Updating Your Repository
To get the most up-to-date builds, you'll have to update your local repository periodically.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to `basefolder` in the console.
3. Ensure you have not made any changes to the local repository (if you did, there might be issues with Git).
	* If you have, try reverting them to their status when you last updated your repository.
4. Execute `git pull version/1.16.3`. This pulls all commits from the official repository that do not yet exist on your local repository and updates it (with GitKraken, click the small pull arrow at the top).

#### Troubleshooting
- Sometimes Gradle tasks fail because of missing memory. For that, you can find system-wide settings in the `.gradle` folder of your `HOME` directory (`~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or on Windows in `C:\Users\username\.gradle\gradle.properties`).
- Sometimes after a branch change, libraries can not be resolved. Running another refresh in IntelliJ or the command line usually solves this issue.

36,YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization,,"# Minecraft server optimization guide

Note for users that are on vanilla, Fabric or Spigot (or anything below Paper) - go to your server.properties and change `sync-chunk-writes` to `false`. This option is forcibly set to false on Paper and its forks, but on other server implementations you need to switch this to false manually. This allows the server to save chunks off the main thread, lessening the load on the main tick loop.

Guide for version 1.19. Some things may still apply to 1.15 - 1.18.

Based on [this guide](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/guide-server-optimization%E2%9A%A1.283181/) and other sources (all of them are linked throughout the guide when relevant).

Use the table of contents located above (next to `README.md`) to easily navigate throughout this guide.

# Intro
There will never be a guide that will give you perfect results. Each server has their own needs and limits on how much you can or are willing to sacrifice. Tinkering around with the options to fine tune them to your servers needs is what it's all about. This guide only aims to help you understand what options have impact on performance and what exactly they change. If you think you found inaccurate information within this guide, you're free to open an issue or set up a pull request to correct it.

# Preparations

## Server JAR
Your choice of server software can make a huge difference in performance and API possibilities. There are currently multiple viable popular server JARs, but there are also a few that you should stay away from for various reasons.

Recommended top picks:
* [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) - The most popular server software that aims to improve performance while fixing gameplay and mechanics inconsistencies.
* [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish) - Paper fork that aims to further improve server performance.
* [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur) - Pufferfish fork focused on features and the freedom of customization.

You should stay away from:
* Any paid server JAR that claims async anything - 99.99% chance of being a scam.
* Bukkit/CraftBukkit/Spigot - Extremely outdated in terms of performance compared to other server software you have access to.
* Any plugin/software that enables/disables/reloads plugins on runtime. See [this section](#plugins-enablingdisabling-other-plugins) to understand why.
* Many forks further downstream from Pufferfish or Purpur will encounter instability and other issues. If you're seeking more performance gains, optimize your server or invest in a personal private fork.

## Map pregen
Map pregeneration, thanks to various optimizations to chunk generation added over the years is now only useful on servers with terrible, single threaded, or limited CPUs. Though, pregeneration is commonly used to generate chunks for world-map plugins such as Pl3xMap or Dynmap.

If you still want to pregen the world, you can use a plugin such as [Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky) to do it. Make sure to set up a world border so your players don't generate new chunks! Note that pregenning can sometimes take hours depending on the radius you set in the pregen plugin. Keep in mind that with Paper and above your tps will not be affected by chunk loading, but the speed of loading chunks can significantly slow down when your server's cpu is overloaded.

It's key to remember that the overworld, nether and the end have separate world borders that need to be set up for each world. The nether dimension is 8x smaller than the overworld (if not modified with a datapack), so if you set the size wrong your players might end up outside of the world border!

**Make sure to set up a vanilla world border (`/worldborder set [diameter]`), as it limits certain functionalities such as lookup range for treasure maps that can cause lag spikes.**

# Configurations

## Networking

### [server.properties]

#### network-compression-threshold

`Good starting value: 256`

This allows you to set the cap for the size of a packet before the server attempts to compress it. Setting it higher can save some CPU resources at the cost of bandwidth, and setting it to -1 disables it. Setting this higher may also hurt clients with slower network connections. If your server is in a network with a proxy or on the same machine (with less than 2 ms ping), disabling this (-1) will be beneficial, since internal network speeds can usually handle the additional uncompressed traffic.

### [purpur.yml]

#### use-alternate-keepalive

`Good starting value: true`

You can enable Purpur's alternate keepalive system so players with bad connection don't get timed out as often. Has known incompatibility with TCPShield.

> Enabling this sends a keepalive packet once per second to a player, and only kicks for timeout if none of them were responded to in 30 seconds. Responding to any of them in any order will keep the player connected. AKA, it won't kick your players because 1 packet gets dropped somewhere along the lines  
~ https://purpurmc.org/docs/Configuration/#use-alternate-keepalive

---

## Chunks

### [server.properties]

#### simulation-distance

`Good starting value: 4`

Simulation distance is distance in chunks around the player that the server will tick. Essentially the distance from the player that things will happen. This includes furnaces smelting, crops and saplings growing, etc. This is an option you want to purposefully set low, somewhere around `3` or `4`, because of the existence of `view-distance`. This allows to load more chunks without ticking them. This effectively allows players to see further without the same performance impact.

#### view-distance

`Good starting value: 7`

This is the distance in chunks that will be sent to players, similar to no-tick-view-distance from paper.

The total view distance will be equal to the greatest value between `simulation-distance` and `view-distance`. For example, if the simulation distance is set to 4, and the view distance is 12, the total distance sent to the client will be 12 chunks.

### [spigot.yml]

#### view-distance

`Good starting value: default`

This value overwrites server.properties one if not set to `default`. You should keep it default to have both simulation and view distance in one place for easier management.

### [paper-world configuration]

#### delay-chunk-unloads-by

`Good starting value: 10s`

This option allows you to configure how long chunks will stay loaded after a player leaves. This helps to not constantly load and unload the same chunks when a player moves back and forth. Too high values can result in way too many chunks being loaded at once. In areas that are frequently teleported to and loaded, consider keeping the area permanently loaded. This will be lighter for your server than constantly loading and unloading chunks.

#### max-auto-save-chunks-per-tick

`Good starting value: 8`

Lets you slow down incremental world saving by spreading the task over time even more for better average performance. You might want to set this higher than `8` with more than 20-30 players. If incremental save can't finish in time then bukkit will automatically save leftover chunks at once and begin the process again.

#### prevent-moving-into-unloaded-chunks

`Good starting value: true`

When enabled, prevents players from moving into unloaded chunks and causing sync loads that bog down the main thread causing lag. The probability of a player stumbling into an unloaded chunk is higher the lower your view-distance is.

#### entity-per-chunk-save-limit

```
Good starting values:

    area_effect_cloud: 8
    arrow: 16
    dragon_fireball: 3
    egg: 8
    ender_pearl: 8
    experience_bottle: 3
    experience_orb: 16
    eye_of_ender: 8
    fireball: 8
    firework_rocket: 8
    llama_spit: 3
    potion: 8
    shulker_bullet: 8
    small_fireball: 8
    snowball: 8
    spectral_arrow: 16
    trident: 16
    wither_skull: 4
```

With the help of this entry you can set limits to how many entities of specified type can be saved. You should provide a limit for each projectile at least to avoid issues with massive amounts of projectiles being saved and your server crashing on loading that. You can put any entity id here, see the minecraft wiki to find IDs of entities. Please adjust the limit to your liking. Suggested value for all projectiles is around `10`. You can also add other entities by their type names to that list. This config option is not designed to prevent players from making large mob farms.

### [pufferfish.yml]

#### max-loads-per-projectile

`Good starting value: 8`

Specifies the maximum amount of chunks a projectile can load in its lifetime. Decreasing will reduce chunk loads caused by entity projectiles, but could cause issues with tridents, enderpearls, etc.

---

## Mobs

### [bukkit.yml]

#### spawn-limits

```
Good starting values:

    monsters: 20
    animals: 5
    water-animals: 2
    water-ambient: 2
    water-underground-creature: 3
    axolotls: 3
    ambient: 1
```

The math of limiting mobs is `[playercount] * [limit]`, where ""playercount"" is current amount of players on the server. Logically, the smaller the numbers are, the less mobs you're gonna see. `per-player-mob-spawn` applies an additional limit to this, ensuring mobs are equally distributed between players. Reducing this is a double-edged sword; yes, your server has less work to do, but in some gamemodes natural-spawning mobs are a big part of a gameplay. You can go as low as 20 or less if you adjust `mob-spawn-range` properly. Setting `mob-spawn-range` lower will make it feel as if there are more mobs around each player. If you are using Paper, you can set mob limits per world in [paper-world configuration].

#### ticks-per

```
Good starting values:

    monster-spawns: 10
    animal-spawns: 400
    water-spawns: 400
    water-ambient-spawns: 400
    water-underground-creature-spawns: 400
    axolotl-spawns: 400
    ambient-spawns: 400
```

This option sets how often (in ticks) the server attempts to spawn certain living entities. Water/ambient mobs do not need to spawn each tick as they don't usually get killed that quickly. As for monsters: Slightly increasing the time between spawns should not impact spawn rates even in mob farms. In most cases all of the values under this option should be higher than `1`. Setting this higher also allows your server to better cope with areas where mob spawning is disabled.

### [spigot.yml]

#### mob-spawn-range

`Good starting value: 3`

Allows you to reduce the range (in chunks) of where mobs will spawn around the player. Depending on your server's gamemode and its playercount you might want to reduce this value along with [bukkit.yml]'s `spawn-limits`. Setting this lower will make it feel as if there are more mobs around you. This should be lower than or equal to your simulation distance, and never larger than your hard despawn range / 16.

#### entity-activation-range

```
Good starting values:

      animals: 16
      monsters: 24
      raiders: 48
      misc: 8
      water: 8
      villagers: 16
      flying-monsters: 48
```

You can set what distance from the player an entity should be for it to tick (do stuff). Reducing those values helps performance, but may result in irresponsive mobs until the player gets really close to them. Lowering this too far can break certain mob farms; iron farms being the most common victim.

#### entity-tracking-range

```
Good starting values:

      players: 48
      animals: 48
      monsters: 48
      misc: 32
      other: 64
```

This is distance in blocks from which entities will be visible. They just won't be sent to players. If set too low this can cause mobs to seem to appear out of nowhere near a player. In the majority of cases this should be higher than your `entity-activation-range`.

#### tick-inactive-villagers

`Good starting value: false`

This allows you to control whether villagers should be ticked outside of the activation range. This will make villagers proceed as normal and ignore the activation range. Disabling this will help performance, but might be confusing for players in certain situations. This may cause issues with iron farms and trade restocking.

#### nerf-spawner-mobs

`Good starting value: true`

You can make mobs spawned by a monster spawner have no AI. Nerfed mobs will do nothing. You can make them jump while in water by changing `spawner-nerfed-mobs-should-jump` to `true` in [paper-world configuration].

### [paper-world configuration]

#### despawn-ranges

```
Good starting values:

      ambient:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      axolotls:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      creature:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      misc:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      monster:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      underground_water_creature:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      water_ambient:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
      water_creature:
        hard: 56
        soft: 30
```

Lets you adjust entity despawn ranges (in blocks). Lower those values to clear the mobs that are far away from the player faster. You should keep soft range around `30` and adjust hard range to a bit more than your actual simulation-distance, so mobs don't immediately despawn when the player goes just beyond the point of a chunk being loaded (this works well because of `delay-chunk-unloads-by` in [paper-world configuration]). When a mob is out of the hard range, it will be instantly despawned. When between the soft and hard range, it will have a random chance of despawning. Your hard range should be larger than your soft range. You should adjust this according to your view distance using `(simulation-distance * 16) + 8`. This partially accounts for chunks that haven't been unloaded yet after player visited them.

#### per-player-mob-spawns

`Good starting value: true`

This option decides if mob spawns should account for how many mobs are around target player already. You can bypass a lot of issues regarding mob spawns being inconsistent due to players creating farms that take up the entire mobcap. This will enable a more singleplayer-like spawning experience, allowing you to set lower `spawn-limits`. Enabling this does come with a very slight performance impact, however it's impact is overshadowed by the improvements in `spawn-limits` it allows.

#### max-entity-collisions

`Good starting value: 2`

Overwrites option with the same name in [spigot.yml]. It lets you decide how many collisions one entity can process at once. Value of `0` will cause inability to push other entities, including players. Value of `2` should be enough in most cases. It's worth noting that this will render maxEntityCramming gamerule useless if its value is over the value of this config option.

#### update-pathfinding-on-block-update

`Good starting value: false`

Disabling this will result in less pathfinding being done, increasing performance. In some cases this will cause mobs to appear more laggy; They will just passively update their path every 5 ticks (0.25 sec).

#### fix-climbing-bypassing-cramming-rule

`Good starting value: true`

Enabling this will fix entities not being affected by cramming while climbing. This will prevent absurd amounts of mobs being stacked in small spaces even if they're climbing (spiders).

#### armor-stands.tick

`Good starting value: false`

In most cases you can safely set this to `false`. If you're using armor stands or any plugins that modify their behavior and you experience issues, re-enable it. This will prevent armor stands from being pushed by water or being affected by gravity.

#### armor-stands.do-collision-entity-lookups

`Good starting value: false`

Here you can disable armor stand collisions. This will help if you have a lot of armor stands and don't need them colliding with anything.

#### tick-rates

```
Good starting values:

  behavior:
    villager:
      validatenearbypoi: 60
      acquirepoi: 120
  sensor:
    villager:
      secondarypoisensor: 80
      nearestbedsensor: 80
      villagerbabiessensor: 40
      playersensor: 40
      nearestlivingentitysensor: 40
```

> It is not recommended to change these values from their defaults while [Pufferfish's DAB](#dabenabled) is enabled!

This decides how often specified behaviors and sensors are being fired in ticks. `acquirepoi` for villagers seems to be the heaviest behavior, so it's been greately increased. Decrease it in case of issues with villagers finding their way around.

### [pufferfish.yml]

#### dab.enabled

`Good starting value: true`

DAB (dynamic activation of brain) reduces the amount an entity is ticked the further away it is from players. DAB works on a gradient instead of a hard cutoff like EAR. Instead of fully ticking close entities and barely ticking far entities, DAB will reduce the amount an entity is ticked based on the result of a calculation influenced by [dab.activation-dist-mod](#dabactivation-dist-mod).

#### dab.max-tick-freq

`Good starting value: 20`

Defines the slowest amount entities farthest from players will be ticked. Increasing this value may improve the performance of entities far from view but may break farms or greatly nerf mob behavior. If enabling DAB breaks mob farms, try decreasing this value.

#### dab.activation-dist-mod

`Good starting value: 7`

Controls the gradient in which mobs are ticked. Decreasing this will activate DAB closer to players, improving DAB's performance gains, but will affect how entities interact with their surroundings and may break mob farms. If enabling DAB breaks mob farms, try increasing this value.

#### enable-async-mob-spawning

`Good starting value: true`

If asynchronous mob spawning should be enabled. For this to work, the Paper's per-player-mob-spawns setting must be enabled. This option does not actually spawn mobs asynchronous, but does offload much of the computational effort involved with spawning new mobs to a different thread. Enabling this option should not be noticeable on vanilla gameplay.

#### enable-suffocation-optimization

`Good starting value: true`

This option optimises a suffocation check (the check to see if a mob is inside a block and if they should take suffocation damage), by rate limiting the check to the damage timeout. This optimisation should be impossible to notice unless you're an extremely technical player who's using tick-precise timing to kill an entity at exactly the right time by suffocation.

#### inactive-goal-selector-throttle

`Good starting value: true`

Throttles the AI goal selector in entity inactive ticks, causing the inactive entities to update their goal selector every 20 ticks instead of every tick. Can improve performance by a few percent, and has minor gameplay implications.

### [purpur.yml]

#### zombie.aggressive-towards-villager-when-lagging

`Good starting value: false`

Enabling this will cause zombies to stop targeting villagers if the server is below the tps threshold set with `lagging-threshold` in [purpur.yml].

#### entities-can-use-portals

`Good starting value: false`

This option can disable portal usage of all entities besides the player. This prevents entities from loading chunks by changing worlds which is handled on the main thread. This has the side effect of entities not being able to go through portals.

#### villager.lobotomize.enabled

`Good starting value: true`

> This should only be enabled if villagers are causing lag! Otherwise, the pathfinding checks may decrease performance.

Lobotomized villagers are stripped from their AI and only restock their offers every so often. Enabling this will lobotomize villagers that are unable to pathfind to their destination. Freeing them should unlobotomize them.

---

## Misc

### [spigot.yml]

#### merge-radius

```
Good starting values:

      item: 3.5
      exp: 4.0
```

This decides the distance between the items and exp orbs to be merged, reducing the amount of items ticking on the ground. Setting this too high will lead to the illusion of items or exp orbs disappearing as they merge together. Setting this too high will break some farms, as well as allow items to teleport through blocks. There are no checks done to prevent items from merging through walls. Exp is only merged on creation.

#### hopper-transfer

`Good starting value: 8`

Time in ticks that hoppers will wait to move an item. Increasing this will help improve performance if there are a lot of hoppers on your server, but will break hopper-based clocks and possibly item sorting systems if set too high.

#### hopper-check

`Good starting value: 8`

Time in ticks between hoppers checking for an item above them or in the inventory above them. Increasing this will help performance if there are a lot of hoppers on your server, but will break hopper-based clocks and item sorting systems relying on water streams.

### [paper-world configuration]

#### alt-item-despawn-rate

```
Good starting values:

      enabled: true
      items:
        cobblestone: 300
        netherrack: 300
        sand: 300
        red_sand: 300
        gravel: 300
        dirt: 300
        grass: 300
        pumpkin: 300
        melon_slice: 300
        kelp: 300
        bamboo: 300
        sugar_cane: 300
        twisting_vines: 300
        weeping_vines: 300
        oak_leaves: 300
        spruce_leaves: 300
        birch_leaves: 300
        jungle_leaves: 300
        acacia_leaves: 300
        dark_oak_leaves: 300
        mangrove_leaves: 300
        cactus: 300
        diorite: 300
        granite: 300
        andesite: 300
        scaffolding: 600
```

This list lets you set alternative time (in ticks) to despawn certain types of dropped items faster or slower than default. This option can be used instead of item clearing plugins along with `merge-radius` to improve performance.

#### redstone-implementation

`Good starting value: ALTERNATE_CURRENT`

Replaces the redstone system with faster and alternative versions that reduce redundant block updates, lowering the amount of logic your server has to calculate. Using a non-vanilla implementation may introduce minor inconsistencies with very technical redstone, but the performance gains far outweigh the possible niche issues. A non-vanilla implementation option may additionally fix other redstone inconsistencies caused by CraftBukkit.

The `ALTERNATE_CURRENT` implementation is based off of the [Alternate Current](https://modrinth.com/mod/alternate-current) mod. More information on this algorithm can be found on their resource page.

#### hopper.disable-move-event

`Good starting value: false`

`InventoryMoveItemEvent` doesn't fire unless there is a plugin actively listening to that event. This means that you only should set this to true if you have such plugin(s) and don't care about them not being able to act on this event. **Do not set to true if you want to use plugins that listen to this event, e.g. protection plugins!**

#### hopper.ignore-occluding-blocks

`Good starting value: true`

Determines if hoppers will ignore containers inside full blocks, for example hopper minecart inside sand or gravel block. Keeping this enabled will break some contraptions depending on that behavior.

#### tick-rates.mob-spawner

`Good starting value: 2`

This option lets you configure how often spawners should be ticked. Higher values mean less lag if you have a lot of spawners, although if set too high (relative to your spawners delay) mob spawn rates will decrease.

#### optimize-explosions

`Good starting value: true`

Setting this to `true` replaces the vanilla explosion algorithm with a faster one, at a cost of slight inaccuracy when calculating explosion damage. This is usually not noticeable.

#### treasure-maps.enabled

`Good starting value: false`

Generating treasure maps is extremely expensive and can hang a server if the structure it's trying to locate is in an ungenerated chunk. It's only safe to enable this if you pregenerated your world and set a vanilla world border.

#### treasure-maps.find-already-discovered

```
Good starting values:
      loot-tables: true
      villager-trade: true
```

Default value of this option forces the newly generated maps to look for unexplored structure, which are usually in not yet generated chunks. Setting this to true makes it so maps can lead to the structures that were discovered earlier. If you don't change this to `true` you may experience the server hanging or crashing when generating new treasure maps. `villager-trade` is for maps traded by villagers and loot-tables refers to anything that generates loot dynamically like treasure chests, dungeon chests, etc.

#### tick-rates.grass-spread

`Good starting value: 4`

Time in ticks between the server trying to spread grass or mycelium. This will make it so large areas of dirt will take a little longer to turn to grass or mycelium. Setting this to around `4` should work nicely if you want to decrease it without the decreased spread rate being noticeable.

#### tick-rates.container-update

`Good starting value: 1`

Time in ticks between container updates. Increasing this might help if container updates cause issues for you (it rarely happens), but makes it easier for players to experience desync when interacting with inventories (ghost items).

#### non-player-arrow-despawn-rate

`Good starting value: 20`

Time in ticks after which arrows shot by mobs should disappear after hitting something. Players can't pick these up anyway, so you may as well set this to something like `20` (1 second).

#### creative-arrow-despawn-rate

`Good starting value: 20`

Time in ticks after which arrows shot by players in creative mode should disappear after hitting something. Players can't pick these up anyway, so you may as well set this to something like `20` (1 second).

### [pufferfish.yml]

#### disable-method-profiler

`Good starting value: true`

This option will disable some additional profiling done by the game. This profiling is not necessary to run in production and can cause additional lag.

### [purpur.yml]

#### dolphin.disable-treasure-searching

`Good starting value: true`

Prevents dolphins from performing structure search similar to treasure maps

#### teleport-if-outside-border

`Good starting value: true`

Allows you to teleport the player to the world spawn if they happen to be outside of the world border. Helpful since the vanilla world border is bypassable and the damage it does to the player can be mitigated.

---

## Helpers

### [paper-world configuration]

#### anti-xray.enabled

`Good starting value: true`

Enable this to hide ores from x-rayers. For detailed configuration of this feature check out [Configuring Anti-Xray](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/anti-xray). Enabling this will actually decrease performance, however it is much more efficient than any anti-xray plugin. In most cases the performance impact will be negligible.

#### nether-ceiling-void-damage-height

`Good starting value: 127`

If this option is greater that `0`, players above the set y level will be damaged as if they were in the void. This will prevent players from using the nether roof. Vanilla nether is 128 blocks tall, so you should probably set it to `127`. If you modify the height of the nether in any way you should set this to `[your_nether_height] - 1`.

---

# Java startup flags
[Vanilla Minecraft and Minecraft server software in version 1.19 requires Java 17 or higher](https://docs.papermc.io/java-install-update). Oracle has changed their licensing, and there is no longer a compelling reason to get your java from them. Recommended vendors are [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) and [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/). Alternative JVM implementations such as OpenJ9 or GraalVM can work, however they are not supported by Paper and have been known to cause issues, therefore they are not currently recommended.

Your garbage collector can be configured to reduce lag spikes caused by big garbage collector tasks. You can find startup flags optimized for Minecraft servers [here](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags) [`SOG`]. Keep in mind that this recommendation will not work on alternative JVM implementations.
It's recommended to use the [flags.sh](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags) startup flags generator to get the correct startup flags for your server

In addition, adding the beta flag `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector` before `-jar` in your startup flags can improve performance. This flag enables Pufferfish to use SIMD instructions on your CPU, making some maths faster. Currently, it's only used for making rendering in game plugin maps (like imageonmaps) possibly 8 times faster.

# ""Too good to be true"" plugins

## Plugins removing ground items
Absolutely unnecessary since they can be replaced with [merge-radius](#merge-radius) and [alt-item-despawn-rate](#alt-item-despawn-rate) and frankly, they're less configurable than basic server configs. They tend to use more resources scanning and removing items than not removing the items at all.

## Mob stacker plugins
It's really hard to justify using one. Stacking naturally spawned entities causes more lag than not stacking them at all due to the server constantly trying to spawn more mobs. The only ""acceptable"" use case is for spawners on servers with a large amount of spawners.

## Plugins enabling/disabling other plugins
Anything that enables or disables plugins on runtime is extremely dangerous. Loading a plugin like that can cause fatal errors with tracking data and disabling a plugin can lead to errors due to removing dependency. The `/reload` command suffers from exact same issues and you can read more about them in [me4502's blog post](https://madelinemiller.dev/blog/problem-with-reload/)

# What's lagging? - measuring performance

## mspt
Paper offers a `/mspt` command that will tell you how much time the server took to calculate recent ticks. If the first and second value you see are lower than 50, then congratulations! Your server is not lagging! If the third value is over 50 then it means there was at least 1 tick that took longer. That's completely normal and happens from time to time, so don't panic.
  
## Spark
[Spark](https://spark.lucko.me/) is a plugin that allows you to profile your server's CPU and memory usage. You can read on how to use it [on its wiki](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/). There's also a guide on how to find the cause of lag spikes [here](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes).

## Timings
Way to see what might be going on when your server is lagging are Timings. Timings is a tool that lets you see exactly what tasks are taking the longest. It's the most basic troubleshooting tool and if you ask for help regarding lag you will most likely be asked for your Timings. Timings is known to have a serious performance impact on servers, it's recommended to use the Spark plugin over Timings and use Purpur or Pufferfish to disable Timings all together.

To get Timings of your server, you just need to execute the `/timings paste` command and click the link you're provided with. You can share this link with other people to let them help you. It's also easy to misread if you don't know what you're doing. There is a detailed [video tutorial by Aikar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4J0A9l7bfQ) on how to read them.

=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dan200/ComputerCraft.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dan200/ComputerCraft)

ComputerCraft is a Minecraft modification which adds programmable Robots and Computers to the world of Minecraft.
If you're not familiar with ComputerCraft, visit the [Website](http://www.computercraft.info/download) or the [Wiki](http://www.computercraft.info/wiki) to find out more.

About this Repository
=====================

ComputerCraft was originally released in late 2011 by [Daniel Ratcliffe](https://twitter.com/DanTwoHundred). In early 2017, after working on the mod solo for five years, it was decided to release the source code publicly to allow Dan to devote time to other projects. This repository marks the first public release of this source code.

The code in this repository will always represent the ""bleeding edge"" of the ComputerCraft codebase, but stable builds back to 1.79 will be marked on the [Releases](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/releases) page.

Contributing
============

While ComputerCraft will no longer be actively developed by Daniel Ratcliffe, you may still contribute pull requests which will be reviewed and incorporated into releases periodically. A pull request is more likely to be accepted if it meets the following criteria:

* It does not add any new dependencies for compiling, running or using the mod.
* It does not break compatibility with world saves or programs created with previous versions of the mod.
* It does not add unneccessary complexity for users of the mod, and maintains the accessibility for which the mod is known.
* It does not add unneccessary complexity or stylistic changes to the code, especially where functionality is not being changed.
* It does not create bugs!

The pull requests most likely to be accepted are those which fix bugs, simplify code, or make the mod compatible with newer versions of Minecraft.

* Be sure to go into options.txt in your .minecraft folder and set ""pauseOnLostFocus"" to ""false""
* Must be done with Minecraft closed

To access your .minecraft folder, open explorer and paste this into the address bar:
* %appdata%\\.minecraft

Alternatively, you can also do F3 + P in game until it says ""Pause on lost focus: disabled""

To Use:

Line yourself up for whatever action you want to take and then bring up the menu. Go into the application and click ""Start"".

Once you click start, you will have 3 seconds to go into the game and exit the menu. When the countdown hits 0, the program will run and will auto tab you out of the game.

When you want to stop, click ""Stop"" and it will stop the action.

40,ReplayMod/ReplayMod,Java,"# ReplayMod
A Minecraft mod to record game sessions and replay them afterwards from any perspective.

## Building
Make sure your sub-projects are up-to-date: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

For compiling 1.7.10, you must run `./gradlew :jGui:1.7.10:setupDecompWorkspace :1.7.10:setupDecompWorkspace` once after the initial clone. This may take quite some time.

### No IDE
You can build the mod by running `./gradlew build` (or just `./gradlew bundleJar`). You can then find the final jar files in `versions/$MCVERSION/build/libs/`.
You can also build single versions by running `./gradlew :1.8:build` (or just `./gradlew :1.8:bundleJar`) (builds the MC 1.8 version).

### IntelliJ
Ensure you have at least IDEA 2020.1.
Build the mod via Gradle as explained above at least once (`./gradlew compileJava` should be sufficient). This will ensure that the sources for all MC versions are generated.
Then import the Gradle project from within IDEA: File -> Open -> build.gradle -> Open as Project
Finally configure IDEA to build everything by itself instead of delegating it to Gradle (cause that is slow): File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Build and run using: IntelliJ IDEA

### Eclipse

## Development
### Branches
Loosely based on [this branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) with `stable` instead of `master`.

TL;DR:
Main development happens on the `develop` branch, snapshots are built from this branch.
The `stable` branch contains the most recent release.

The `master` branch is solely to be used for the `version.json` file that contains a list of all versions
used by the clients to check for updates of this mod.

### The Preprocessor
To support multiple Minecraft versions with the ReplayMod, a [JCP](https://github.com/raydac/java-comment-preprocessor)-inspired preprocessor is used.
It has by now acquired a lot more sophisticated features to make it as noninvasive as possible.
Please read the [preprocessor's README](https://github.com/ReplayMod/preprocessor/blob/master/README.md) to understand how it works.

### Versioning
The ReplayMod uses the versioning scheme outlined [here](https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/1.12.x/conventions/versioning/)
with three changes:
- No `MAJORAPI`, the ReplayMod does not provide any external API
- ""Updating to a new Minecraft version"" should not increment `MAJORMOD`, we maintain one version of the ReplayMod
for each version of Minecraft and all these versions share the same feature set (and most bugs). We therefore try to
keep the version name the same for all of them (with the exception of `MCVERSION` of course). This also means that the
""Multiple Minecraft Version"" section does not apply.
- For pre-releases the shorter `-bX` is used instead of `-betaX`

When a new version is (pre-)release, a new commit modifying the `version.txt` file should be added and the
`versions.json` file in the `master` branch should be updated. To simplify this process the gradle task `doRelease` can
be used: `./gradlew -PreleaseVersion=2.0.0-rc1 doRelease`. It will create the commit and update the version.json
accordingly.

Care should be taken that the updated `version.json` is not pushed before a jar file is available on the
download page (or Jenkins) as it will inform the users of the update.

### Bugs
GitHub should generally be used to report bugs.

In the past, bugs were tracked via [Bugzilla](https://bugs.replaymod.com/), so bug numbers in commits prior to 2020 such as `(fixes #42)` generally referred to Bugzilla unless noted otherwise.

## License
The ReplayMod is provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 3 or (at your option) any later version.

_MinecraftStats_ is a web browser application for the [statistics](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Statistics) that Minecraft servers collect about players.

The presentation is done by giving __awards__ to players for certain achievements. For example, the player who played on the server for the longest total time receives the _Addict_ award. Every award has a viewable ranking associated to it with __medals__ - the award holder gets the gold medal, the second the silver medal and the third the bronze medal for the award. Each medal gives players a __crown score__ (1 for every bronze medal, 2 for every silver, 4 for every gold medal), which is displayed in a server __hall of fame__.

The system is highly customizable. All the awards are defined in Python modules that can be altered, added or removed to fit your needs. Additionally to simply reading Minecraft's original statistics, there are some awards that are combinations of various statistics.

A live demo of _MinecraftStats_ in action is available here: [DVG Snapshot Stats](http://mine3.dvgaming.com/)

Feel free to join the project [Discord](https://discord.gg/brH5PGG8By) 

## Setup Guide
This section describes how to set up _MinecraftStats_ to work on your server.

### Compatibility
_MinecraftStats_ is compatible only to Minecraft 1.13 or later (more precisely: snapshot [17w47a](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/17w47a) or later).

I am trying to keep the statistics up to date with new Minecraft versions. However, Mojang sometimes decide to rename entity or statistic IDs, which may break some awards. I am trying my best to update accordingly, but please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/pdinklag/MinecraftStats/issues) in case you notice something is wrong!

### Requirements
_Python 3.4_ or later is required to feed _MinecraftStats_ with your server's data.

### Installation

I recommend using git to check out the `master` branch of this repository somewhere under your webserver's document root (e.g. `/var/www/html`), as it makes updating easier (see below).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pdinklag/MinecraftStats.git
```

However, downloading the repository as a zip file and unpacking it there will work as well.

The web application is accessed via `index.html` - so you'll simply need to point your players to the URL corresponding to the installation path.

##### Updating MinecraftStats

To update _MinecraftStats_ to a newer version, if you are using git, the following will do the trick:

```sh
git pull
```

Otherwise, re-download the repository and overwrite any existing files.

### Feeding The Data

The heart of _MinecraftStats_ is the `update.py` script, which loads the player statistics from your Minecraft server into the database for the web application. Said database is file-based and will be stored in the `data` directory by default.

To call the update script, simply go into the installation directory and execute the following:

```sh
python3 update.py config.json
```

When you do this for the first time, the file called `config.json` will be created for you with a default configuration.

You will also receive the following message:

```
server.path not configured, please edit config.json
```

This is because _MinecraftStats_ does not yet know where your Minecraft server is installed. So go ahead and enter the path to your Minecraft server under the `server > path` setting in `config.json`. See below for more configuration possibilities.

### Configuration

The configuration JSON file supprots the following settings:

* `client`
  * `defaultLanguage` - the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) code of the default language to use when none was explicitly selected by the user (*default: en*) .
  * `playerCacheUUIDPrefix` - short explanation: *do not touch*. Determines player cache grouping by UUIDs. Most of the time you should leave the default value of 2 untouched. If you have *many* active players on your server (e.g., thousands) and wish to reduce traffic and load times somewhat, you may try increasing this to 3 to see if it helps. Note that increasing this value will increase the number of files under `data/playercache` *exponentially* (!), so handle with care (*default: 2*).
  * `playersPerPage` - how many players to display at most in the players list (*default: 100*).
  * `showLastOnline` - if `true`, the last online date and time will be displayed for players (*default: true*).
* `configVersion` - used internally, do not change manually.
* `crown`
  * `bronze` - the crown score worth of a bronze medal (*default: 1*)
  * `silver` - the crown score worth of a silver medal (*default: 2*)
  * `gold` - the crown score worth of a gold medal (*default: 4*)
* `events` - see below in the *Events* section.
* `players`
  * `exclude` - a list of UUIDs to exclude from the stats (*default: empty*)
  * `excludeBanned` - if `true`, exclude players listed in `banned-players.json` from the stats (*default: true*)
  * `excludeOps` - if `true`, exclude players listed in `ops.json` from the stats (*default: false*)
  * `inactiveDays` - if a player is inactive for this many days, they will no longer be eligible for any awards (*default: 7*)
* `minPlaytime` - only players having played this many minutes or more will be eligible for awards (*default: 0*)
  * `profileUpdateInterval` - update player names and skins using the Mojang API every this many days (*default: 3*)
  * `updateInactive` - also update names and skins of inactive players (not recommended) (*default: false*)
* `server`
  * `sources` - a list of data sources, each of which must define the following
    * `path` - the path to the Minecraft server installation (*no default*)
    * `worldName` the name of the world on the server that contains the player statistics (`stats` directory with JSON files in it). In most cases, this is simply `world` (*default: world*).
  * `customName` - the server name to display on the home page. Leave this at `null` to use the MOTD from your `server.properties` (*default: null*)

A nice commented overview with default values can also be found in `mcstats/config.py`

##### Combining Multiple Servers

You can combine multiple servers (e.g., servers connected via BungeeCord) into a single stat database by listing multiple entries in the `server` &rarr; `sources` configuration like so:

```json
{
    ""server"": {
        ""sources"": [
            {
                ""path"": ""/opt/minecraft/server1"",
                ""worldName"": ""world1""
            },
            {
                ""path"": ""/opt/minecraft/server2"",
                ""worldName"": ""world2""
            },
        ],
    },
}
```

Any number of servers can be combined this way. Note that *MinecraftStats* will get the server name (MOTD) and icon from the first source only.

##### Migrating Command-Line Configurations

If you have been using _MinecraftStats_ before the configuration was changed to JSON-based, you can use the `makeconfig.py` script with all your old arguments to generate the corresponding JSON configuration, for example:

```sh
python3 makeconfig.py -s /path/to/server --min-playtime 60 > config.json
```

Note that the way how events are started and stopped has changed. You will find the new information in the *Events* section.

#### Troubleshooting

You may encounter the following messages during the update:

* `update.py: error: unrecognized arguments: ...` - if you are sure that everything is right, it may be that when you last used *MinecraftStats*, configuration was still done via the command line. This has changed and you need to switch to the JSON based configuration described above. You can call `makeconfig.py` with the old list of arguments to create a JSON file from it to make the process easier.

* `updating profile for <player> ...` - the updater needs to download the player's skin URL every so often using Mojang's web API ,so that the browser won't have to do it later and slow the web application down. __If this fails__, make sure that Python is able to open `https` connections to `sessionserver.mojang.com`.
* `HTTP Error 429` - Mojang has some limitations on their API that MinecraftStats uses to get player skins. If too many requests for the same player are done within a certain time frame (the exact specs are not known to me), Mojang's API refuses the request with a 429 code. This normally shouldn't happen if you use the default profile update interval.
* `unsupported data version 0 for <player>` - this means that `<player>` has not logged into your server for a long time and his data format is still from Minecraft 1.12.2 or earlier.

In case you encounter any error messages and can't find an explanation, don't hesistate to [open an issue](https://github.com/pdinklag/MinecraftStats/issues).

After the update, you will have a `data` directory that contains everything the web application needs; refer to the *Database Structure* section for details.

### Automatic Updates
_MinecraftStats_ does not include any means for automatic updates - you need to take care of this yourself.

#### Cronjobs

The most common way to do it on Linux servers is by creating a cronjob that starts the update script regularly, e.g., every 10 minutes.

:warning: Note that ​ *MinecraftStats* will produce the output (`data` directory) in the *current working directory*, and not simply where `update.py` is located. This means that your cronjob may have to start with a `cd` to your *MinecraftStats* directory, otherwise the output will be created in the home directory of the cron user.

Typically, a cronjob for *MinecraftStats* will look like this:

```
# update MinecraftStats every 10 minutes
 */10 *  *  *  *  cd /path/to/mcstats ; python3 update.py config.json
```

#### Windows

If you're using Windows to run your server... figure something out! There's probably some task scheduler available that you can use.

### FTP
In case you use FTP to transfer the JSON files to another machine before updating, please note that _MinecraftStats_ uses a JSON file's last modified date in order to determine a player's last play time. Therefore, in order for it to function correctly, the last modified timestamps of the files need to be retained.

### Database Structure
The `data` directory will contain the following after running an update:
* `summary.json.gz` - This is a summary for the web application, containing information about the server and everything needed to display the award listing.
* `server-icon.png` - if your server has an icon, this will be a copy of it. Otherwise, a default icon will be used.
* `events` - contains one JSON file for every event containing player scores.
* `playercache` - cache of player names and skin IDs, grouped by player UUIDs.
* `playerdata` - contains one JSON file for every player, containing information displayed in the player view.
* `playerlist` - contains an index for player information used by the player list.
* `rankings` - contains one JSON file for every award containing player rankings.

## Events
Events allow you to track a specific award stat for a limited amount of time. You can plan events via the `events` list in the config JSON. The following information needs to be specified for an event:

* `name` - the *unique* internal name of the event, which needs to be a valid file and URL name, i.e., you should not use spaces or special characters here. Every event needs a different name, even if they share the same title, and they must not collide with the ID of any actual stat.
* `title` - the title of the event displayed in the browser.
* `stat` - the ID of the award stat counted for the event. An easy way to find these IDs is by clicking an award in the browser and getting it from the URL.
* `startTime` - the time at which the event starts in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, where the hour field assumes a 24h day).
* `endTime` - the time at which the event ends (same format as `startTime`).

When you run `update.py`, events will automatically be started or stopped based on the current server time. Please note that there should be at least one update *before* the event starts, so that each player's initial score can be saved.

##### Event Example

As an example, let's consider a Halloween-themed event called ""Skeleton Hunt"" that tracks how many skeletons people kill between October 30, 10 o'clock in the morning and midnight of November 1. We would add the following to the config JSON:

```json
...
	""events"": [
        {
            ""name"": ""skeleton_hunt_2021"",
            ""title"": ""Skeleton Hunt"",
            ""stat"": ""kill_skeleton"",
            ""startTime"": ""2021-10-30 10:00"",
            ""endTime"": ""2021-01-01 00:00""
        }
    ],
...
```

## Customizing Awards

I assume here that you have some very basic knowledge of Python, however, you may also get away without any.

`update.py` imports all modules from the `mcstats/stats` directory. Here you will find many `.py` files that define the awards in a pretty straightforward way.

Any changes will be in effect the next time `update.py` is executed.

### Adding New Awards
For adding a new award, follow these steps:

1. Create a new module in `mcstats/stats` and register your `MinecraftStat` instances (see below).
2. Place an icon for the award in `img/award-icons`. If your award ID is `my_award`, the icon's file name needs to be `my_award.png`.

#### The MinecraftStat Class
A `MinecraftStat` object consists of an _ID_, some _meta information_ (_title_, _description_ and a _unit_ for statistic values) and a _StatReader_.

The _ID_ is simply the award's internal identifier. It is used for the database and the web application also uses it to locate the award icon (`img/award-icons/<id>.png`).

The _meta information_ is for display in the web application. The following units are supported:
* `int` - a simple integer number with no unit.
* `ticks` - time statistics are usually measured in ticks. The web application will convert this into a human readable duration (seconds, minutes, hours, ...).
* `cm` - Minecraft measures distances in centimeters. The web application will convert this to a suitable metric unit.

The _StatReader_ is responsible for calculating the displayed and ranked statistic value. Most commonly, this simply reads one single entry from a player's statistics JSON, but more complex calculations are possible (e.g., summing up various statistics like for the `mine_stone`.

There are various readers, the usage of which is best explained by having a close look to the existing awards. If you require new types of calculations, dig in the `mcstats/mcstats.py` file and expand upon what's there.

### Modifying and Removing Awards
In order to modify or remove an award, find the corresponding module and modify or delete it to suit your needs.

Note that some awards, e.g., all the mob kill awards, are grouped into a single python file.

## Development Notes
This section contains some hints for those who want to develop on _MinecraftStats_.

### Web Frontend Localization

The web frontend is fully localized. If you cannot find your language yet, please feel very welcome to provide a localization and create a pull request! In order to add a new language, two things have to be done:

* Create a new language JSON file in the `localizations` directory and fill it with your translations. For the file name, please choose the corresponding [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) code for your language.
* Find the `mcstats.languages` array in `js/dev/mcstats-localization.js` and add a new entry for your language there. The text should be the name of the language in that language (e.g. ""Deutsch"" for German, which is the German word for ""German"").

### JavaScript and CSS minimization

In an effort to reduce client traffic, the JavaScript and CSS files of the web UI are minified. The JavaScripts are minified using [terser](https://github.com/terser/terser). Refer to the `minimize.sh` script located in the `js` directory for the command-line used to do so. For CSS minimization, I use [uglifycss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglifycss) without any special command-line parameters.

## License and Attribution

_MinecraftStats_ is released under the [Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. This means you can pretty much use and modify it freely, with the only requirements being attribution and not putting it under restrictive (e.g., commercial) licenses if modified.

Concerning the _attribution_ part, the only requirement is that you provide a visible link to [this original repository](https://github.com/pdinklag/MinecraftStats) in your installment. The easiest way to do this is by not removing it from the `index.html` footer, where you will also find a reminder about this.

MultiMC
=======

MultiMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

## Development
If you want to contribute, talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/multimc) first.

While blindly submitting PRs is definitely possible, they're not necessarily going to get accepted.

We aren't looking for flashy features, but expanding upon the existing feature set without disruption or endangering the future viability of the project is OK.

### Building
If you want to build the launcher yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

### Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:
* Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
* Prefer readability over dogma.
* Keep to the existing formatting.
* Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
* Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.

## Translations
Translations can be done [on crowdin](https://translate.multimc.org). Please avoid making direct pull requests to the translations repository.

## Forking/Redistributing/Custom builds policy
We keep Launcher open source because we think it's important to be able to see the source code for a project like this, and we do so using the Apache license.

The license gives you access to the source MultiMC is built from, but not:
- The name, logo and other branding.
- The API tokens required to talk to services that the launcher depends on.

Because of the nature of the agreements required to interact with the Microsoft identity platform, it's impossible for us to continue allowing everyone to build the code as 'MultiMC'. The source code has been debranded and now builds as `DevLauncher` by default.

You must provide your own branding if you want to distribute your own builds.

You will also have to register your own app on Azure to be able to handle Microsoft account logins.

If you decide to fork the project, a mention of its origins in the About dialog and the license is acceptable. However, it should be abundantly clear that the project is a fork *without* implying that you have our blessing.

## Contributing

If you want to help but are not sure what to do, take a look at our [planning board](https://github.com/orgs/Wurst-Imperium/projects/5/views/1) or the [help wanted list](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). Of course you can contribute anything you like, but these issues are particularly useful.

If you are contributing multiple unrelated features, please create a separate pull request for each feature. Squeezing everything into one giant pull request makes it very difficult for me to add your features, as I have to test, validate and add them one by one.

Thank you for your understanding - and thanks again for taking the time to contribute!!

## Translations

We have a [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/wurst7) for translations. You can also submit translations here on GitHub, but Crowdin is preferred since it makes it much easier to resolve issues.

To enable translations in-game, go to Wurst Options > Translations > ON.

Names of features (hacks/commands/etc.) should always be kept in English. This ensures that everyone can use the same commands, keybinds, etc. regardless of their language setting. It also makes it easier to communicate with someone who uses Wurst in a different language.

The translation files are located in [this folder](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/tree/master/src/main/resources/assets/wurst/lang), in case you need them.

# LuckPerms
[![Build Status](https://ci.lucko.me/job/LuckPerms/badge/icon)](https://ci.lucko.me/job/LuckPerms/)

LuckPerms is a permissions plugin for Minecraft servers. It allows server admins to control what features players can use by creating groups and assigning permissions.

The latest downloads, wiki & other useful links can be found on the project homepage at [luckperms.net](https://luckperms.net/).

It is:

* **fast** - written with performance and scalability in mind.
* **reliable** - trusted by thousands of server admins, and the largest of server networks.
* **easy to use** - setup permissions using commands, directly in config files, or using the web editor.
* **flexible** - supports a variety of data storage options, and works on lots of different server types.
* **extensive** - a plethora of customization options and settings which can be changed to suit your server.
* **free** - available for download and usage at no cost, and permissively licensed so it can remain free forever.

For more information, see the wiki article on [Why LuckPerms?](https://luckperms.net/wiki/Why-LuckPerms)

## Building
LuckPerms uses Gradle to handle dependencies & building.

#### Requirements
* Java 8 JDK or newer
* Git

#### Compiling from source
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms.git
cd LuckPerms/
./gradlew build
```

You can find the output jars in the `loader/build/libs` or `build/libs` directories.

## Contributing
#### Pull Requests
If you make any changes or improvements to the plugin which you think would be beneficial to others, please consider making a pull request to merge your changes back into the upstream project. (especially if your changes are bug fixes!)

LuckPerms loosely follows the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Generally, try to copy the style of code found in the class you're editing. 

#### Project Layout
The project is split up into a few separate modules.

* **API** - The public, semantically versioned API used by other plugins wishing to integrate with and retrieve data from LuckPerms. This module (for the most part) does not contain any implementation itself, and is provided by the plugin.
* **Common** - The common module contains most of the code which implements the respective LuckPerms plugins. This abstract module reduces duplicated code throughout the project.
* **Bukkit, BungeeCord, Fabric, Forge, Nukkit, Sponge & Velocity** - Each use the common module to implement plugins on the respective server platforms.

## License
LuckPerms is licensed under the permissive MIT license. Please see [`LICENSE.txt`](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for more info.

51,overshard/docker-minecraft,Shell,"# docker-minecraft

A nice and easy way to get a Minecraft server up and running using docker. For
help on getting started with docker see the [official getting started guide][0].
For more information on Minecraft and check out it's [website][1].


## Building docker-minecraft

Running this will build you a docker image with the latest version of both
docker-minecraft and Minecraft itself.

    git clone https://github.com/overshard/docker-minecraft
    cd docker-minecraft
    sudo docker build -t overshard/minecraft .


## Running docker-minecraft

Running the first time will set your port to a static port of your choice so
that you can easily map a proxy to. If this is the only thing running on your
system you can map the port to 25565 and no proxy is needed. i.e.
`-p=25565:25565` . If you want to enable the query protocol you need
to add another -p=25565:25565/udp to forward the UDP protocol on the
same port as well.
Also be sure your mounted directory on your host machine is
already created before running `mkdir -p /mnt/minecraft`.

    sudo docker run -d=true -p=25565:25565 -v=/mnt/minecraft:/data overshard/minecraft /start

From now on when you start/stop docker-minecraft you should use the container id
with the following commands. To get your container id, after you initial run
type `sudo docker ps` and it will show up on the left side followed by the
image name which is `overshard/minecraft:latest`.

    sudo docker start <container_id>
    sudo docker stop <container_id>


### Notes on the run command

 + `-v` is the volume you are mounting `-v=host_dir:docker_dir`
 + `overshard/minecraft` is simply what I called my docker build of this image
 + `-d=true` allows this to run cleanly as a daemon, remove for debugging
 + `-p` is the port it connects to, `-p=host_port:docker_port`

Minecraft Region Fixer
======================

By Alejandro Aguilera (Fenixin) 

Locates problems and tries to fix Minecraft worlds (or region files).

Minecraft Region Fixer tries to fix corrupted chunks in region files using old backup copies
of the Minecraft world. If you don't have a copy, you can eliminate the
corrupted chunks making Minecraft regenerate them.

It also scans the 'level.dat' file and the player '\*.dat' and tries to 
read them. If there are any problems it prints warnings. At the moment
it doesn't fix any problem in these files.

Web page:
https://github.com/Fenixin/Minecraft-Region-Fixer

Mincraft forums posts:
https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/server-support-and/1903200-minecraft-region-fixer
https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-tools/1261480-minecraft-region-fixer

Supported platforms
===================
This program only works with Python 3.x, and DOESN'T work with
python 2.x. There was a Windows .exe for older versions, but right
now you need to install the python interpreter to run this
program.

Notes
=====
Older versions of Minecraft had big problems when loading broken
worlds. Newer versions of Minecraft are improving the way
they deal with corruption and other things.

Region-Fixer still is useful for replacing chunks/regions with a 
backup, removing entities, or trying to see what's going wrong
with your world.


Usage
=====
You can read the program help running: ""python regionfixer.py --help""

For usage examples and more info visit the wiki:

Bugs, suggestions, feedback, questions
======================================
Suggestions and bugs should go to the github page:

Donations and sponsors
======================
Region-Fixer was created thanks to sponsors and donations. You can find
information about that in DONORS.txt


Contributors
============
See CONTRIBUTORS.txt


Warning
=======
This program has been tested with a lot of worlds, but there may exist 
bugs, so please, MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR WORLD BEFORE RUNNING it,
I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE OF WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR WORLD. Other way to say it 
is USE THIS TOOL AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Think that you are playing with your precious saved games :P .

Good luck! :)
"
53,MightyPirates/OpenComputers,Scala,"![Welcome to OpenComputers](assets/misc/banner.png)

OpenComputers is a Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers and robots to the game. The built-in computer implementation uses Lua 5.2 and is fully persistent. This means programs will continue running across reloads. For more information, please [see the wiki][wiki]. Feel invited to visit the [community forums][forums] or drop by in the [IRC channel #oc on esper.net][irc].

A few useful links:
* [Minecraft Forum Thread][mcf]
* [Downloads][releases]
* [Bug Tracker][issues]
* [Wiki][wiki]
* [Ingame Manual][ingame manual]
* [IRC][irc]
* [Community Forums][forums]

### Experimental Builds
You can find experimental builds [on the build server][github-actions]. Expect these to be generally more unstable than builds marked as releases. Use these **at your own risk**, but - when using the latest one - please *do* report bugs you encounter using them. Thanks!

## License / Use in Modpacks
This mod is [licensed under the **MIT license**](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/blob/master-MC1.7.10/LICENSE). All **assets are public domain**, unless otherwise stated; all are free to be distributed as long as the license / source credits are kept. This means you can use this mod in any mod pack **as you please**. I'd be happy to hear about you using it, though, just out of curiosity.

## Contributing
### Assets and Localizations
1. **Translations**  
   Translations to other languages are very much appreciated. You can find the localization files [in this folder][localizations]. If a localization you wanted to create already exists, please take the time to see if the present one is complete - the strings change every so often, invalidating some of the translations. If you start a fresh localization, please base it off of the English or German one, those are the 'master' localization files. If you add a new language, please also add it to [the pack.mcmeta][pack.mcmeta] file. Keep it sorted alphabetically, use the name and region Minecraft itself uses. If you don't know how to do that, that's OK, I'll do it later.
2. **Textures**  
   If you would like to contribute better textures for certain items or blocks, feel free to pull-request them. If you would like to contribute *alternative* textures, make it a resource pack, and post it on the forums, for example.
3. **Documentation**  
   Help with keeping the [wiki][] up to date would be *really* appreciated. If you notice anything amiss and know better, fix it. If you don't ask someone who does, then fix it. If you had a question answered, consider adding that information somewhere in the wiki where you would have expected to find that information.  
   There are also the files containing the ingame help [for programs][manpages] and [for blocks and items][manual], which could probably be much better than they are right now. Improvements to them, and new ones (e.g. for the libraries, such as `text` or `sides`) would help a lot. Thanks!
4. **Robot Names**  
   Robots get a random name when placed (unless set with an Anvil). The list the names are chose from [can be found here][robot names]. Feel free to pull request additional names! *However*: since the list has grown to a considerable length already, here are the two basic criteria for new names: it must either be a real or fictional robot, or an AI that at least *appears* to be self-aware.

### Bug fixes, features and scripts
1. **Bugs**  
   If you've found a bug, please report it in the [issue tracker][issues], after checking it has not been reported before - and possibly even fixed by now. If you think you can and have fixed it, feel free to do a pull request, I'll happily pull it if it looks all right to me - otherwise I'll gladly tell you what to change to get it merged.
2. **Features**  
   If you'd like to propose a new feature, take it to the [forums][] or the [issue tracker][issues]. If you'd like to contribute code that adds new features, please make sure to discuss the feature with me, first - again, the issue tracker is an OK place for this, there are a couple of feature requests there, already. Alternatively start a topic on the forums to discuss the feature, and / or stop by the [IRC][irc] to talk about it. Blind / unexpected feature pull requests might very well not make it, so save yourself some time by talking about it, first! Thanks.
3. **Scripts / Programs**  
   OpenComputers generates floppy disks in dungeon chests that can contain data from a selection of 'loot' directories. For example, the IRC client and OPPM (a package manager) are two programs that can be found on such loot disks. If you'd like to contribute a program that can be found this way, please have a look at [the loot readme][loot], which explains how to add custom loot. Simply pull request your loot!
4. **Core Scripts**  
   If you would like to contribute scripts to the ""core"" Lua code (which basically defines 'OpenOS'), please have a look at the [code conventions][] for Lua to save us all some time. Bug fixes are always welcome. Additional programs and features should be kept small. Bigger programs (rule of thumb: larger than 3KiB) should go onto loot disks.
5. **Drivers**  
   As of OC 1.4, mod interaction that was previously provided by OpenComponents it now fully integrated into OC itself. If you wish to contribute a driver for blocks from other mods, cool! Have a look at the [integration][] package to get an idea of how to structure modules and read the readme in that package for more information (in particular on additional criteria to get your PR merged).

#### Pull requests
The following are a few quick guidelines on pull requests. That is to say they are not necessarily *rules*, so there may be exceptions and all that. Just try to stick to those points as a baseline.
- Make sure your code is formatted properly.
- Make sure it builds and works.
- Try to keep your changes as minimal as possible. In particular, no whitespace changes in existing files, please.
- Feel free to code in Java, but don't be surprised if I convert it to Scala later on, if I feel it makes the code more concise ;-)
- When adding mod dependencies, keep them *weak*, i.e. make sure OC still works without that mod. Also, prefer adding a Gradle dependency over adding API class files to the repo.
- [Squash](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) your commits!

Also, and this should go without saying, your contributed code will also fall under OC's license, unless otherwise specified (in the super rare case of adding third-party stuff, add the according license information as a `LICENSE-???` file, please).

## Extending
### In your own mod
To use [the API][api] in your own mod, either get the API JAR from the [build server][github-actions], or if you're using [Gradle](http://gradle.org/), add a dependency to the maven repo:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url = ""http://maven.cil.li/"" }
}
dependencies {
    compile ""li.cil.oc:OpenComputers:MC1.7.10-1.5.+:api""
}
```
Adjust the version number accordingly to the version you'd like to build against.

To run the mod in your development environment, download the [`dev` JAR from the build server][dev-jar] and drop it into your development environment's `eclipse/mods` (Eclipse) or `run/mods` (IntelliJ IDEA) folder.

Alternatively, leave out the `api` classifier and you can build against the dev JAR directly. This way you don't have to add it to your mods folder, but you will have to add `-Dfml.coreMods.load=li.cil.oc.common.launch.TransformerLoader` to the VM options in your run configuration.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask, either in the [forums][] or in the [IRC][irc]!

### OpenComputers
Want to tinker with the mod itself? Here is how - for IntelliJ IDEA users.

**Important**
- Make sure you have the Gradle plugin enabled in IntelliJ IDEA (File->Settings->Plugins).
- Make sure you have the Scala plugin enabled.

Clone the repository, then in it run  
`gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`  
to setup the workspace, including assets and such, then  
`gradlew idea`  
to create an IntelliJ IDEA project.

Open the project and you will be asked to *import the Gradle project* (check your Event Log if you missed the pop-up). **Do so**. This will configure additionally referenced libraries.

For more specific instructions, read [Steps to run master MC1.7.10 from IDEA][idea_1.7.10]

In the case you wish to use Eclipse rather than IntelliJ IDEA, the process is mostly the same, except you must run `gradlew eclipse` rather than `gradlew idea`.

=====================
Minecraft Comes Alive (MCA) is a Minecraft mod that replaces Minecraft's villagers with normal player-like NPCs. It works in single player, LAN, and SMP.

Villagers can be interacted with - you can talk to them, ask them to follow you, set their home, give them gifts, etc. Interacting with people builds relationships. Get your relationship high enough and you will be able to marry someone.

After getting married, you will be able to have children who will do many chores for you such as: Farming, Fishing, Woodcutting, Hunting, and Mining.

Children will eventually grow up into adults. Adults can get married and have children of their own, and this cycle can repeat indefinitely!

## Dependencies
At runtime, MCA has no external dependencies other than Minecraft Forge.

For development, MCA depends on Lombok. It will be installed automatically when you set up your development environment. Install the Lombok plugin for your relevant IDE if you have trouble building in your IDE.

## Contributing
Any contributions to are welcome. Simply clone into your workspace, set it up, make your changes, and submit a pull request for review.

Hey creeps! These are couple PHP scripts that make it rather simple to display who is currently online on your Minecraft server.

== index.php

This script parses your server.log file generated by your Minecraft server and tells you:

  Who is online or offline
  When they were last logged on
  How many times they have logged on
  How long they have been logged on for this session
  Total time they have ever been on the server
  Most recent things said in chat
  Displays the actual face from their Minecraft skin (generated by avatar.php)

Just throw this file on a webserver, along with your server.log file.

Extra uses:
By adding '?total' to the end of the URL, you can sort the list by total time spent online in the server.
By adding '?chat' to the end of the URL, you can see the 30 most recent items said in the server chat!
(Example: http://yourserver.com/minecraft/index.php?total)

== avatar.php

This script magically pulls out the face of your Minecraft.net into a new PNG image of specified size.

Now supports local image caching!

== Minecraft Google Map

As a bonus, you can generate a map of your Minecraft world and use Google Maps API to view it. Check it out: https://github.com/brownan/Minecraft-Overviewer
Or use Tectonicus: http://triangularpixels.net/games/tectonicus/

== Changes

[![Join our Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/289587909051416579.svg?logo=discord&label=)](https://discord.gg/papermc)

A Minecraft server proxy with unparalleled server support, scalability,
and flexibility.

Velocity is licensed under the GPLv3 license.

## Goals

* A codebase that is easy to dive into and consistently follows best practices
  for Java projects as much as reasonably possible.
* High performance: handle thousands of players on one proxy.
* A new, refreshing API built from the ground up to be flexible and powerful
  whilst avoiding design mistakes and suboptimal designs from other proxies.
* First-class support for Paper, Sponge, and Forge. (Other implementations
  may work, but we make every endeavor to support these server implementations
  specifically.)
  
## Building

Velocity is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org). We recommend using the
wrapper script (`./gradlew`) as our CI builds using it.

It is sufficient to run `./gradlew build` to run the full build cycle.

## Running

Once you've built Velocity, you can copy and run the `-all` JAR from
`proxy/build/libs`. Velocity will generate a default configuration file
and you can configure it from there.

Alternatively, you can get the proxy JAR from the [downloads](https://papermc.io/downloads#Velocity)
page.

# Immersive Vehicles (Formerly Transport Simulator)
From the folks that brought you Minecraft Flight Simulator comes the all-new Immersive Vehicles mod!\
This mod is the result of over a year's worth of work and is the continuation and future of Minecraft Flight Simulator.

## Building From Source or Contributing
To build from source, you will need to do a few things.  These instructions assume you are on Windows.  If you are on Linux, you should be able to tell where your instructions differ and how to handle such differences.

<ol>
<li>Create a fork of this repository.  Git has tons of tutorials for this.</li>
<li>Ensure you have Git Bash installed.  While you can make updates and commits through the web interface, this is a Bad Idea and will lead to pain down the road.  Command line programs are your freind when coding.</li>
<li>Open Git Bash in the folder where you want to keep your code via the right-click option `Git Bash Here`.  Then do a `git clone URL`, where the URL is the one for your forked repository.  Git will download all your code and files locally to allow you to start programming.</li>
<li>Ensure you have the Java 8 JDK installed.  This is NOT the same as the Java 8 JRE program that you use to run most Java applications.  You will specifically need to install the JDK.  Check your progam files if you are un-sure.</li>
<li>If you just installed the JDK, you will need to update your `path`.  This is a System Environment Variable on Windows that tells it where to look for things.  You want to add the directory where the Java 8 JDK was installed (likely `C:\Program Files\Java\SomeJDKVersion\bin`.  If you already have Java 8 JRE installed, you will see it in this list.  Just remove that entry and replace it with the Java 8 JDK entry (the location should match except for one folder).  You know you have done this correctly if you can open your command prompt and type `javac` and get a result besides ""command not found"".  (Note, you will have to close and open Command Prompt to reflect any PATH changes.</li>
<li>Now that you have your Java set up, you can use the same Git Bash prompt inside the folder you just cloned to setup your workspace:</li>
<ul>
<li>If you are running Eclipse, run `./gradlew eclipse` and then `./gradlew genEclipseRuns`.  Then open your Eclipse program.  When it asks you for a ""workspace location"" do NOT pick any folder to do with code.  Just pick a folder somewhere where Eclipse can throw things and you can forget about.  Once this is done, you need to go into the menu and ""Import Gradle Project"".  Pick the folder where all your code was copied to and the files should show up in the editor.  To test them, you can click the little bug icon and then go to Debug Configurations->Java Application-runClient. Select this, and go to the Environment tab and delete the MC_VERSION entry.  Apply, close, and then select it for debugging and you're off to testing your code!</li>
<li>If you are using IDEA, import the build script (`build.gradle`) with IDEA then run the `genIntellijRuns` Gradle task when it finishes importing.</li>
<li>If you are running VSCode, run `./gradlew genVSCodeRuns`.  Then bug TurboDefender on the Discord to fill this section out.</li>
<li>If you aren't using any of these three, START DOING SO.  Notepad is not meant for coding.  Do you want a Bad Time?  I didn't think so.</li>
</ul>
<li>After making your code changes, use Git Bash to do a `git add -u` to add all modified files.  Then you can do a `git commit -m ""Message for what you commited""`. This marks the changes, and the reason for them.  Finally, do a `git push` to push the changes back up to Git.  From there, you can create a Pull Request and have your code be part of the mod!</li>
</ol>

61,trevor-laher/OnDemandMinecraft,Python,"# On Demand Minecraft Server
Using a Python Flask application and AWS, this repository launches an AWS EC2 Instance to host a Minecraft server upon request from users through the web application. The server will automatically shut down after the server has crashed or is empty for 15 minutes. This makes server hosting for small communities very inexpensive. For up to 20 players you can expect $0.02 per hour the server runs. The largest benefit of this system is that the server bill diminishes if your community decides to take a break from the game, and will be ready to pick back up when you want to play again. No subscriptions are required.

Note that this configuration will likely require familiarity with programming, SSH, and the command line.


# AWS Setup
This step will properly configure your AWS account and configuration.py file so that an instance can be created via the createInstance.py script.

 1. Create or access an **AWS Account**. Under the **User Dropdown** in the    **Toolbar**, select **Security Credentials**, then **Access Keys**, and finally **Create New Access Key**. Download this file, open it, and copy the values of **AWSAccessKeyId** and **AWSSecretKey** to **ACCESS_KEY** and **SECRET_KEY** in the **configuration.py** file in the root directory of the repository.
	
	<code>ACCESS_KEY = 'YourAWSAccessKeyIdHere'
	SECRET_KEY  =  'YourAWSSecretKeyHere'</code> 

 3. Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard** under the **Services Dropdown** and select **Security Groups** in the sidebar. Select **Create Security Group**, input **minecraft** for the **Security group name**. Create **Inbound Rules** for the following:
	 - Type: **SSH** Protocol: **TCP** Port Range: **22** Source: **Anywhere**
	 - Type: **Custom TCP Rule** Protocol: **TCP** Port Range: **25565** Source: **Anywhere**
	 - Type: **Custom UDP Rule** Protocol: **UDP** Port Range: **25565** Source: **Anywhere**
	 
	 In **configuration.py** in the root directory, set **ec2_secgroups** to the name of the security group.
	 
	 <code>ec2_secgroups =  ['YourGroupNameHere']</code>

3. Under the **EC2 Dashboard** navigate to **Key Pairs** in the sidebar. Select **Create Key Pair**, provide a name and create. Move the file that is downloaded into the root directory of the project. In **configuration.py** in the root directory, set ** ec2_keypair** to the name entered, and **SSH_KEY_FILE_NAME** to the name.pem of the file downloaded.

	THIS MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE
		<code>ec2_keypair =  'YourKeyPairName'
		SSH_KEY_FILE_PATH  =  './YourKeyFileName.pem'</code>

4. This step is concerned with creating the AWS instance. View [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) (Or google AWS Regions), and copy the  **Region** column for the **Region Name** of where you wish to host your server. In **configuration.py** of the root directory, set the **ec2_region** variable to the copied value.

	<code>ec2_region =  ""Your-Region-Here""</code>

5. Navigate to [https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) and select one of the T3 types (with the memory and CPU you desire, I recommend 10 players/GB). Copy the value in the **Model** column. I've configured mine to use **t3.small**. In **configuration.py** of the root directory, set the **ec2_instancetype** variable to the copied value.

	<code>ec2_instancetype =  't3.yourSizeHere'</code>

6. Then we must select an image for the instance to boot. Navigate to [https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/), in the filter at the bottom of the screen, select your region of choice under **Zone**, pick any LTS (Latest Stable) under **Version**, under **Arch** select **amd64**, and **hvm:ebs** under **Instance Type**. Select one of the images available and copy the **AMI-ID**. In **configuration.py** of the root directory, set the **ec2_amis** variable to the copied value.

	<code>ec2_amis =  ['ami-YourImageIdHere']</code>

7. At this point you should have the necessary configuration to create a new instance through the **createInstance.py** script in the **root** folder. Open a command line in the utilityScripts directory of the project, and execute:

	<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
	
	After successful installation of dependencies execute:

	<code>python utilityScripts/createInstance.py</code>

	Copy the **Instance ID** that is output into the terminal. In **configuration.py** of the root directory, set the **INSTANCE_ID** variable to the copied value.

	<code>INSTANCE_ID  =  'i-yourInstanceIdHere'</code>


# Web Application Deployment
In this step the project will get deployed to Heroku's free hosting. This part of the application provides a rudimentary UI and Web URL for users to start the server.

Before deployment it will be important to set the password for the server to start. In **configuration.py** of the root directory, set the **SERVER_PASSWORD** variable to the password of your choosing.

   <code>SERVER_PASSWORD='YourPasswordHere'</code>
 1. Create or have access to a Heroku account.
 2. Install and setup the **Heroku CLI** onto your computer. [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)
 3. In the command line for the directory of this project, type:
	 <code>heroku create YourProjectNameHere</code>
4. Once this new project has been created, it is time to push the project to Heroku.
	<code>git push heroku master</code>
5. The URL to your hosted site should be: YourProjectNameHere.herokuapp.com
6. Access your site and launch/access your server!

# AWS Instance Configuration
This step will configure the AWS Linux server to run the minecraft server. It will include SSH connecting to the server, gaining admin privileges, installing java, directory setup, moving shell scripts onto the server, and making a CRON job for these shell scripts. Note that this step will include both an SSH client and a File Transfer client (such as FileZilla) on your PC.
1. The first step will be to get SSH into the server instance. Using the key downloaded from AWS in the section above, add this key to PuTTY or simply access it through command line. The IP address can be obtained by entering the server password on the site, or through the EC2 Dashboard, selecting the iPV4 address from the corresponding instanceID in your configuration file. For MacOS and Linux systems

	<code>ssh -i pathToYourKeyFileHere ubuntu@IPAddress</code>

2. Make the ubuntu user admin if it isn't already with:
 
	<code>adduser ubuntu sudo</code>

3. The next step will be to install JavaJDK onto your system. For newer versions you may enter:
	<code>sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk-headless</code>
	If this doesn't work you can use <code>sudo apt list</code> and search through these packages for an alternative java version.

4. Open up an FTP client such as FileZilla and connect to the same address as the same user with the same IP address. Drag all files from the **instanceSetup** folder from this repository, into the root directory of the current user (probably **ubuntu**, for the purposes of these commands I will be using **ubuntu**, but feel free to replace with your own user if appropriate).

5.  Download the desired Minecraft server version from [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/), rename it **server.jar** and drag it into the root directory of the user using FileZilla.

6. Using the FTP client, create a new folder in the root directory of the current user called **screens**  
OR  
In the SSH client, create a folder in the current directory with the command:
	<code>sudo mkdir screens</code>
7. Then execute the following command:
   <code>sudo chmod 700 /home/ubuntu</code>
8. Then execute the next command:
  <code>export SCREENDIR=/home/ubuntu/screens</code>
9. Then execute the command:
  <code>sudo crontab /home/ubuntu/crontab -u ubuntu</code>

	Feel free to close the server through the AWS console or execute the command:
	<code>sudo /sbin/shutdown -P +1</code>

At this point you may restart the server from the Web Application using the password you configured. You should then be able to play!

# Additional Remarks
## Minecraft Memory Configuration
The server startup command does not specify memory constraints by default, but is available to be specified in Configuration.py. In the event that you configure this from an empty string, **the trailing space is required** as in the example below. Traditional minecraft server flags apply for this configuration.
<code>MEMORY_ALLOCATION='-Xmx1024M -Xms1024M '</code>
## UI Configuration
The title and header for the site can be changed in **/templates/index.html**. Feel free to add any more content or styling to the site, though be careful not to change any form, input, button, or script elements in the template.

## Server Maintenance
Maintaining the server is fairly straightforward and is done primarily through FileZilla. Updating the server file can be done by downloading the new server file, renaming it to **server.jar** and replacing the old file on the server. The world file can be backed up to your PC manually though there is no automated process at this time.

Cuberite is a Minecraft-compatible multiplayer game server that is written in C++ and designed to be efficient with memory and CPU, as well as having a flexible Lua Plugin API. Cuberite is compatible with the Java Edition Minecraft client.

Cuberite runs on Windows, *nix and Android operating systems. This includes Android phones and tablets as well as Raspberry Pis.

Currently we support Release 1.8 - 1.12.2 Minecraft protocol versions.

Subscribe to [the newsletter][1] for important updates and project news.

## Installation

There are several ways to obtain Cuberite.

### Binaries

- The easiest method is downloading for Windows or Linux from the [website][2].
- You can use the EasyInstall script for Linux and macOS, which automatically downloads the correct binary. The script is described below.

#### The EasyInstall script

This script will download the correct binary from the project site.

    curl -sSfL https://download.cuberite.org | sh

### Compiling

- You can compile automatically for Linux, macOS and FreeBSD with the `compile.sh` script. The script is described below.
- You can also compile manually. See [COMPILING.md][4].

Compiling may provide better performance (1.5-3x as fast) and it supports more operating systems.

#### The compile.sh script

This script downloads the source code and compiles it. The script is smart enough to notify you of missing dependencies and instructing you on how to install them. The script doesn't work for Windows.

Using curl:

    sh -c ""$(curl -sSfL -o - https://compile.cuberite.org)""

Or using wget:

    sh -c ""$(wget -O - https://compile.cuberite.org)""

Web based Minecraft chat client for 1.8 servers.

![MinecraftChat Screenshot](http://puu.sh/hwR1L/9e88547904.png)

### Description
This is a very lightweight application... ~500kb without modules. It is built on Node and utilizes tools such as [mineflayer](https://github.com/andrewrk/mineflayer), [node-minecraft-protocol](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol#windows) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/). The whole purpose is that you can chat on Minecraft servers from your browser. This makes it easier to just jump in, say a few things, and leave without having to wait for your game to load.

### Installing on your own server
```
git clone https://github.com/AlexKvazos/MinecraftChat
cd MinecraftChat
npm install && grunt build
npm start
```

This will start the application on port `3000` or the one specified by the `PORT`environment variable.

### Grunt tasks

* `grunt debug` - Builds the client-side javascript application with no minification
* `grunt build` - Builds the client-side javascript application with minification
* `grunt watch` - Automatically runs `grunt debug` when client-side code changes
* `grunt server` - Starts server and automatically restart when server-side code changes

* From [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk)'s ashes here comes PojavLauncher!

* PojavLauncher is a launcher that allows you to play Minecraft:Java Edition on your Android device!

* It can run almost every version of the Minecraft, allowing you to use .jar only installers to install modloaders like [forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/), [fabric](http://fabricmc.net/), [optifine](https://optifine.net); Utility and hack clients like [LabyMod](https://www.labymod.net/en), [Wurst](https://www.wurstclient.net/) and much more!

* For more details [check out our wiki](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/wiki)
## Some notes to start with
- We do not exist on TikTok. No one from the dev team makes TikTok videos. 
- The official Twitter for PojavLauncher is [@PLaunchTeam](https://twitter.com/PLaunchTeam). Any others (most notably @PojavLauncher) are fake, please report them to Twitter's moderation team.

* PojavLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS based on [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk). 
* This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions ranging from rd-132211 to 1.19 snapshots (including Combat Test versions). 
* Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported. 
* This repository contains source code for Android. 
* For iOS/iPadOS, check out [PojavLauncher_iOS](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS).

## Getting PojavLauncher

Getting PojavLauncher is divided into 3 parts.

1. You can get prebuilt app from [stable releases](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/releases) or [automatic builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/actions).

2. You can get it from Google Play by clicking:
[![Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kdt.pojavlaunch)

3. You can [build](#building) from source.
## Building
If you want to build after launcher code changes, follow the steps below.
### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- JRE for Android is [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/openjdk-multiarch-jdk8u), and the build script is [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch).
- Follow build instruction on build script [README.md](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/blob/buildjre8/README.md).
- You can also get [CI auto builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/actions) if you are lazy or failing it for some reason.
* Either get `jre8-pojav` artifact from auto builds, or do splitting by yourself:</br>
   - Get JREs for all of 4 supported architectures (arm, arm64, x86, x86_64) </br> 
      - Split JRE into parts:</br>
                Platform-independent: .jar files, libraries, configs, etc...</br>
                Platform-dependent: .so files, etc...</br>
        - Create:</br>
                A file named `universal.tar.xz` with all platform-independent files</br>
                4 files named `bin-<arch>.tar.xz` with all platform-dependent files per-architecture</br>
        - Put these in `assets/components/jre/` folder</br>
        - (If needed) update the Version file with the current date</br>

### LWJGL
- **Coming soon**

### The Launcher
- Because languages are auto added by Crowdin, you need to run language list generator before building. In the project directory, run:

* On Linux, Mac OS:
```
chmod +x scripts/languagelist_updater.sh
bash scripts/languagelist_updater.sh
```
* On Windows:
```
scripts\languagelist_updater.bat
```
Then, run these commands ~~or build using Android Studio~~.

* Build GLFW stub:
```
./gradlew :jre_lwjgl3glfw:build
```       
* Build the launcher
```
./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug
```
(Replace `gradlew` to `gradlew.bat` if you are building on Windows).

67,johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC,C,"# MinecraftC - A Raytraced Minecraft Classic Port to C

### Features:
- True to the original version (0.0.30a)
- Implemented fully in C using SDL2 and OpenGL 1.1
- Original music and sounds
- A modded and vanilla version
- Works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS
- CMake build system
#### Raytracing:
- Uses an 8-bit distance field as an acceleration structure
- In some cases, performance is better than the original
  - 60+ fps at 1080p on the integrated graphics cards I've tested
- To enable raytracing, download the modded binary and enable it in the mods screen under options

## Downloads
- There are two versions, modded and vanilla, where vanilla doesn't have the option to turn on mods
- [Windows 32 bit](https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC/releases)
- [Windows 64 bit](https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC/releases)
- [MacOS x86_64](https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC/releases)
- [MacOS ARM](https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC/releases)

## Building
Note: if you would like to build the vanilla version, remove `-DMINECRAFTC_MODS=1` from the cmake command
### Requirements:
- `git`
- `cmake`
- A compiler of your choice

### Windows instructions for Visual Studio:
1. Run the following commands:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC.git
cd MinecraftC
mkdir Build
cd Build
cmake -DMINECRAFTC_MODS=1 -G""Visual Studio 17"" .. # replace ""Visual Studio 17"" with your version
```
2. You should now have `MinecraftC.sln` in your directory that you can open with Visual Studio and build

### MacOS instructions for Xcode:
1. Run the following commands:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC.git
cd MinecraftC
mkdir Build && cd Build
cmake -DMINECRAFTC_MODS -GXcode ..
```
2. You should now have `MinecraftC.xcodeproj` in your directory that you open with Xcode and build

3. (optional) If you would like it in a .app format, you can run this command to convert your executable:
```
python3 Scripts/MacOS-App.py <path-to-executable> [developer-id]
```
Providing the developer id will sign the .app, which you can find by running `security find-identity`

### Linux instructions (untested):
1. If you don't have SDL2 already, run these commands:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```
2. Run the following commands:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/johnpayne-dev/MinecraftC.git
cd MinecraftC
mkdir Build && cd Build
cmake -DMINECRAFTC_MODS=1 ..
make
```

### Modifying Resources
If you're creating a mod and want to change or add any `.png` or `.ogg` resouces, then run this script to update the resource headers:
```sh
python3 Scripts/EmbedResources.py
```
It will recursively go through all `.png` and `.ogg` files in `Resources/`, and convert them to `.h`

## Known Issues
- There is no survival mode, it was removed for simplicity and compatibility with raytracing
- A few sounds have the incorrect pitch, I'm waiting for cute_sound.h to implement pitch shifting
- Load file and save file are not implemented
- If raytracing doesn't turn on, then something is going wrong with OpenCL, report an issue and I can help troubleshoot

## Updates
For updates and release notes, please read the [CHANGELOG](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

**Migrating to Minetrack 5?** See the [migration guide](docs/MIGRATING.md).

## Installation
1. Node 12.4.0+ is required (you can check your version using `node -v`)
2. Make sure everything is correct in ```config.json```.
3. Add/remove servers by editing the ```servers.json``` file
4. Run ```npm install```
5. Run ```npm run build``` (this bundles `assets/` into `dist/`)
6. Run ```node main.js``` to boot the system (may need sudo!)

(There's also ```install.sh``` and ```start.sh```, but they may not work for your OS.)

Database logging is disabled by default. You can enable it in ```config.json``` by setting ```logToDatabase``` to true.
This requires sqlite3 drivers to be installed.

## Docker
Minetrack can be built and run with Docker from this repository in several ways:

### Build and deploy directly with Docker
```
# build image with name minetrack and tag latest
docker build . --tag minetrack:latest

# start container, delete on exit
# publish container port 8080 on host port 80
docker run --rm --publish 80:8080 minetrack:latest
```

The published port can be changed by modifying the parameter argument, e.g.:  
* Publish to host port 8080: `--publish 8080:8080`  
* Publish to localhost (thus prohibiting external access): `--publish 127.0.0.1:8080:8080`

### Build and deploy with docker-compose
```
# build and start service
docker-compose up --build

# stop service and remove artifacts
docker-compose down
```

## Nginx reverse proxy
The following configuration enables Nginx to act as reverse proxy for a Minetrack instance that is available at port 8080 on localhost:
```
server {
    server_name minetrack.example.net;
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    }
}
```

Compiling
---------
Add a new project from existing sources in whatever IDE you use. Add minecraft_servero.jar as a library, and mysql-connector-java-bin.jar if need be. Your IDE should compile .class files that you can copy over into a clean minecraft_server.jar, then you can test your changes.

# How to build
Dynmap 3.x+ uses Gradle for building support for all platforms, with all resulting artifacts produced in the /targets directory.  Due to Minecraft 1.18.x+ requirements, the developer's
default JDK must be a JDK 17 (or later) versions - older versions will still be compiled
to run on the default JDK for those platforms (JDK 8, or JDK 16 for 1.17.x), and common libraries are built JDK 8.

To build and get all jars in `target/`, run:

    ./gradlew setup build
    
Or (on Windows):

    gradlew.bat setup build
    
The Forge 1.12.2 versions (specifically ForgeGradle for these) are very sensitive to being built by JDK 8, so to build them, 
set JAVA_HOME to correspond to a JDK 8 installation, then build using the following;

    cd oldgradle
    ./gradlew setup build
    
Or (on Windows):

    cd oldgradle
    gradlew.bat setup build

Those familiar with gradle can save time by specifying a build (or commenting in settings.gradle) BUT this is not suitable for uploading DEV code changes.

NOTE: PR code submissions MUST be built and TESTED for ALL platforms (including oldgradle), or be rejected and negatively influence future approvals. 
For more check [contributing rules](#contributing-to-dynmaps-code).

    ./gradlew :fabric-1.18:build

# Data Storage
Dynmap supports the following storage backends:
- Flat files: The default for a new installation
- MySQL†
- SQLite†
- PostgreSQL (JDBC driver for this is now bundled with the Dynmap JAR)
- MariaDB - is compatible with MySQL
- AWS S3 (allows S3 bucket to be used for storage AND as web site host)
- †Note: drivers for SQL are usually included for Spigot and its derivatives but not included with other platforms or Dynmap. For Forge and Fabric servers we recommend Kosma's [SQLite mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sqlite-jdbc) or [MySQL mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mysql-jdbc) to add the needed drivers. Additionally, injecting driver classes into jar file will be recognized and supported.

# Contributing to Dynmap's Code
The Dynmap team welcomes Pull Requests with fixes, new features, and new platform support.  That said, the following rules apply:
- Ultimately, we reserve the right to accept or deny a PR for any reason: fact is, by accepting it, we're also accepting any of the problems with supporting it,
explaining it to users, and fixing current and future problems - if we don't think the PR is of value consistent with that cost, we'll probably not accept it.
- All PRs should be as small as they can be to accomplish the feature or fix being supplied.  To that end:
   - Do not lump multiple features into one PR - you'll be asked to split them up before they will be reviewed or accepted
   - Do not make style changes, reflow code, pretty printing, or otherwise make formatting-only code changes.  This makes the PR excessively large, 
   creating changes to be reviewed that don't actually do anything (but we have to review them to be sure they aren't being used to disguise security 
   compromises or other malicious code), and they create problems with the MANY people who fork Dynmap for the sake of doing PRs or their own private
   custom builds - since all theose modified lines create merge conflicts - once again, with no actual function having been accomplished.  If we decide
   the code needs to be 'prettied up', it'll be done by the Dynmap team.
- Do not make changes to core code (anything in DynmapCore or DynmapCoreAPI) unless you're ready to build and test it on all supported platforms.  Code that
breaks building of ANY supported platform will be rejected.
- Likewise, any Spigot related changes are expected to function correctly on all supported Spigot and PaperMC versions (currently 1.10.2 through 1.18.1).  
- Do not include any code that involves platform specific native libraries or command line behaviors.  Dynmap supports 32-bit and 64-bit, Windows, lots of
Linux versions (both x86 and ARM), MacOS, being used in Docker environments, and more - this is all about staying as 'pure Java' as the Minecraft server itself
is.  If your PR includes platform specific dependencies that are not coded to handle working on all the above platforms properly, the PR will be rejected.
- Dynmap's code is Apache Public License v2 - do not include any code that is not compatible with this license.  By contributing code, you are agreeing to
that code being subject to the APL v2.
- Do not include any code that unconditionally adds to Dynmap's hosting requirements - for example, support for a database can be added, but the use of the
database (which likely depends on a database server being deployed and configured by the user) cannot become an unconditional requirement in order to run
Dynmap.  Features can add the option to exploit new or additional technologies, but cannot add unconditionally to the minimum requirements on the supported
platforms (which is what is needed to run the corresponding MC server, plus the Dynmap plugin or mod)
- Dynmap is built and supports running on Java 8 - it can run on newer versions, but any contributed code and dependencies MUST support being compiled and run
using just Java 8.
- Don't introduce other language dependencies - Java only: no Kotlin, Scala, JRuby, whatever. They just add runtime dependencies that most of the platforms lack,
and language skills above and beyond the Java language requirements the code base already mandates, which just creates obstacles to other people contributing.
- Similarly, do not update existing libraries and dependencies - these are often tied to the versions on various platforms, and updates will likely break runtime
- Do not include code specific to other plugins or mods.  Dynmap has APIs for the purpose of avoiding the problem of working with other mods - there are many 
'Dynmap-XXX' mods and plugins which use the APIs to provide support for other mods and plugins (WorldGuard, Nucleus, Citizens, dozens of others).  Maintaining
interfaces in Dynmap particular to dozens of mods on multiple versions of multiple platforms is unmanageable, so we don't do it.  The ONLY exception currently
are security mods - although, even for those, leverage of platform-standard security interfaces is always preferred (e.g. Sponge or Bukkit standard permissions)

# Porting, Supporting Other Platforms, Customized Dynmap Builds
While Dynmap is open source, subject to the Apache Public License, v2, the Dynmap team does have specific policies and requirements for anyone that would
use the code here for anything except building contributions submitted back to this code base as Pull Requests (which is the only process by which code is accepted and can become part of a release supported by the Dynmap team).  Other authorized uses include:

- Building custom version of Dynmap for use on a personal or on a specific server, so long as this version is NOT distributed to other parties. 
The modifying team agrees to not pursue support from the Dynmap team for this modified private version, but is otherwise not required to share the 
modified source code - though doing so is encouraged.
- Building a modified version of Dynmap for otherwise unsupported platforms: in this event, the modified version MUST be for a platform or version 
not yet (or no longer) supported by the Dynmap team.  If the Dynmap team comes to support this platform or version, the modifying team must agree to
cease distribution of the unofficial version, unless otherwise authorized to continue doing so.  Further:
    - The team distributing the modified version must cite the origin of the Dynmap code, but must also clearly indicate that the version is NOT supported by
    nor endorsed by the Dynmap team, and that ALL support should be directed through the team providing the modified version.
    - Any modified version CANNOT be monetized or otherwise charged for, under any circumstances, nor can redistribution of it be limited or restricted.
    - The modified code must continue to be Apache Public License v2, with no additional conditions or restrictions, including full public availability of the
    modified source code.
    - Any code from Dynmap used in such versions should be built from an appropriate fork, as DynmapCore and other components (other than DynmapCoreAPI and 
    dynmap-api) are subject to breaking changes at any time, and the support messages in DynmapCore MUST be modified to refer to the supporting team (or, at
    least, removed).  The modified version should NOT refer to the Dynmap Discord nor to /r/Dynmap on Reddit for support. in any case.
    - Any bugs or issues opened in conjunction with the use of the modified version on this repository will be closed without comment.

Additions of new functions, including new platform support, in this official Dynmap code base MUST be fully contained within the PRs submitted to this 
repository.  Further, it is always expected than any updates will be built and tested across all relevant platforms - meaning any chances to shared code 
components (DynmapCore, DynmapCoreAPI) MUST be successfully built and tested on ALL supported platforms (Forge, Spigot, etc).  Changes which break 
supported platforms will be rejected.

The only interfaces published and maintained as 'stable' are the interfaces of the DynmapCoreAPI (cross platform) and dynmap-api (Bukkit/spigot specific) 
libraries.  All other components are NOT libraries - DynmapCore, in particular, is a shared code component across the various platforms, but is subject to 
breaking changes without warning or consideration - any use of DynmapCore interfaces by code outside this repository is NOT supported, and will likely 
result in breaking of such consuming code without warning and without apology.  DynmapCore is an internal shared code component, not a library - please
treat it accordingly.

Plugins or mods using the published APIs - DynmapCoreAPI (for all platforms) or dynmap-api (only for Spigot/Bukkit) - may access these components as 
'compile' dependencies: DO NOT INTEGRATE THEM INTO YOUR PLUGIN - this will break Dynmap and/or other plugins when these interfaces are updated or 
expanded.  These libraries are published at https://repo.mikeprimm.com and will be updated each official release.

**For Minecraft 1.13, see issue [#113](https://github.com/mapcrafter/mapcrafter/issues/275). TL;DR: Minecraft 1.13 support is pretty much complete, few small features and full documentation are still in progress. Can be built from source from `world113` branch or [nightly packages](https://mapcrafter.org/downloads/nightly) can be used.**

by Moritz Hilscher

*Due to my university studies and other projects, unfortunately I'm not able to develop new features for Mapcrafter anymore. I'll try to keep up with the issues on GitHub from time to time, so if you're experiencing a problem, don't mind reporting it. You can still submit feature requests in case I or someone else decides to do some work on Mapcrafter. I'm happy about PRs too. If you want to work on Mapcrafter and need help with something just ask me (Mail, IRC, GitHub), I can tell you a bit about how the project is structured.*

Mapcrafter is a high performance Minecraft map renderer written in C++. It renders
Minecraft worlds to a bunch of images which are viewable in any webbrowser
using Leaflet.js.

Mapcrafter is free software and available under the GPL license.  You can
access the latest source code of Mapcrafter on GitHub:
http://github.com/mapcrafter/mapcrafter

Thanks to pigmap and Minecraft Overviewer, whose documentations and source code
were very helpful. I also used the alpha blending code of pigmap and some maps
stuff of the template from Minecraft Overviewer.

<div align=""center"">
    <img src=""http://i.imgur.com/WyKXrgO.png"" />
</div>

## Features ##

* **Web output:** Render your Minecraft worlds to maps viewable in any webbrowser!
* **Different render views:** Choose between different perspectives to render your world
  from! A 2D topdown and a 3D isometric render view are available!
* **Different rotations:** Choose from four different rotations to render your worlds from!
* **Different render modes:** Choose between different render modes like day, night and cave 
  for your maps!
* **Different overlays:** Show additional information on your map! For example: Where can
  slimes spawn? Where can monsters spawn at night?
* **Configuration files:** Highly-customizable which worlds are rendered with which render
  view and other render parameters!
* **Markers:** Automatically generated markers from your Minecraft world data!
* **Other stuff:** Biome colors, incremental rendering, multithreading

## Requirements ##

* A Linux-based or Unix-like operating system like Mac OS
* A decent C++ compiler (preferable gcc >= 4.4, or clang), CMake and make if you want to build
      Mapcrafter from source
* Some libraries:
  * libpng
  * libjpeg (but you should use libjpeg-turbo as drop in replacement)
  * libboost-iostreams
  * libboost-system
  * libboost-filesystem (>= 1.42)
  * libboost-program-options
  * (libboost-test if you want to use the tests)
* For your Minecraft worlds:
  * Anvil world format
  * Minecraft 1.6 resource packs

## Examples ##

There are a few example maps of the renderer on the [GitHub
Wiki](https://github.com/mapcrafter/mapcrafter/wiki/Example-maps).  Please feel free
to add your own map to this list.

## Documentation and Help ##

The documentation is in the `docs/` directory and you can build it yourself
with Sphinx. You can read a built version of the documentation on
[docs.mapcrafter.org](http://docs.mapcrafter.org) and you can also [download
other builds](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mapcrafter/downloads/).

If you find bugs or problems when using Mapcrafter or if you have ideas for new
features, then please feel free to add an issue to the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/mapcrafter/mapcrafter/issues).

You can contact me in IRC (#mapcrafter on Freenode). Use the 
[webclient](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mapcrafter>) if you
are new to IRC. I will be there most of the time, but please bear in mind
that I can't be available all the time. If I'm not there, wait some time or 
try another time of the day.

You can also ask questions in the [Minecraft Forum
thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1632003-mapcrafter-fast-minecraft-map-renderer/).

A single init script which makes running multiple Minecraft/Bukkit servers easier for us admins.

## Quick Installers

Install MSM on a **debian box**:

    wget -q http://git.io/Sxpr9g -O /tmp/msm && bash /tmp/msm

Or install MSM under **RedHat**:

	wget -q http://git.io/lu0ULA -O /tmp/msm && bash /tmp/msm

Or [suggest a new platform][issues].

## Getting Started

* [Install][install] MSM on your box.
* [Visit the docs][docs] for help with getting started.
* Fork and contribute your own modifications.
* Not a coder? [Post an issue][issues] with your idea for MSM instead.
* Read the [changelog][changelog] to get a picture of how MSM has evolved over time.

MSM is released under the GPLv3 licence, which is included in the repository [here][licence]. I'm open to suggestions where licencing is concerned.

## Features

As well as starting, stopping and restarting MSM has the following features:

* One script handles multiple servers, run two or more servers on one machine.
* Can create and start new servers with a single command, downloads the jars for you.
* Periodically makes [WorldEdit snapshot][we-snapshot] compatible backups of your worlds.
* Backup the entire server directory for complete protection.
* Load world's into RAM for faster access (reduces lag).
* Easily configurable global defaults, with per server overrides if needed.
* Apply server commands to one, multiple, or all servers in one go (useful for whitelisting a player on all servers.)
* Tab completion for all commands, makes everything faster and getting started a breeze.
* Keep server logs organsied by periodically ""rolling"" them.
* Organises jar files into groups (such as minecraft and craftbukkit) and links each server to a single jar. Includes automated download of new versions.
* Plethora of in-game commands (whitelist, blacklist, operator, gamemode, kick, say, time, toggledownfall, save)
* Send commands straight to the server via the command line.

## Support

1. If you find a problem with MSM and you think the problem is one that requires changing code [submit an issue][issues] via GitHub.

## Upcoming features

* **QuickBackup:** If you store your backups non-locally (maybe on a NAS), QuickBackup optionally creates a backup locally for speed, and then moves it after your players are building again! My initial testing shows a 54 second network backup confaltes to 23 seconds of in-game time.
* **Restore:** Roll-back to an old world or whole server backup automatically.


## Versioning

MSM uses semantic version numbers to better describe what code one might have installed, and indicate backwards incompatible changes.

Releases will be numbered in the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

For more information on SemVer, visit http://semver.org/.

# Sodium (for Fabric)
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric.svg)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric.svg)
![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric.svg)

Sodium is a free and open-source optimization mod for the Minecraft client that improves frame rates, reduces
micro-stutter, and fixes graphical issues in Minecraft. 

:warning: Sodium has had a lot of time to shape up lately, but the mod is still alpha software. You may run into minor
graphical issues or crashes while using it. Additionally, the
[Fabric Rendering API](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/documentation:rendering) is not yet supported, which may cause crashes
and other issues with some mods.

---

## Installation

### Manual installation (recommended)

You will need Fabric Loader 0.10.x or newer installed in your game in order to load Sodium. If you haven't installed
Fabric mods before, you can find a variety of community guides for doing so [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install).

#### Stable releases

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric.svg)

The latest releases of Sodium are published to our [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) and
[GitHub release](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/releases) pages. Releases are considered by our team to be
**suitable for general use**, but they are not guaranteed to be free of bugs and other issues.

Usually, releases will be made available on GitHub slightly sooner than other locations.

#### Bleeding-edge builds (unstable)

[![GitHub build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/gradle-ci/1.17.x/dev)](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

If you are a player who is looking to get your hands on the latest **bleeding-edge changes for testing**, consider
taking a look at the automated builds produced through our [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml?query=event%3Apush).
This workflow automatically runs every time a change is pushed to the repository, and as such, the builds it produces
will generally reflect the latest snapshot of development.

Bleeding edge builds will often include unfinished code that hasn't been extensively tested. That code may introduce
incomplete features, bugs, crashes, and all other kinds of weird issues. You **should not use these bleeding edge builds**
unless you know what you are doing and are comfortable with software debugging. If you report issues using these builds,
we will expect that this is the case. Caveat emptor.

### CurseForge

[![CurseForge downloads](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_394468_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium)

If you are using the CurseForge client, you can continue to find downloads through our
[CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium). Unless you are using the CurseForge
client, you should prefer the downloads linked on our Modrinth or GitHub release pages above.

---

### Reporting Issues

You can report bugs and crashes by opening an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues).
Before opening a new issue, use the search tool to make sure that your issue has not already been reported and ensure
that you have completely filled out the issue template. Issues that are duplicates or do not contain the necessary
information to triage and debug may be closed. 

Please note that while the issue tracker is open to feature requests, development is primarily focused on
improving hardware compatibility, performance, and finishing any unimplemented features necessary for parity with
the vanilla renderer.

### Community
[![Discord chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat%20on-discord-7289DA?logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://jellysquid.me/discord)

We have an [official Discord community](https://jellysquid.me/discord) for all of our projects. By joining, you can:
- Get installation help and technical support with all of our mods 
- Be notified of the latest developments as they happen
- Get involved and collaborate with the rest of our team
- ... and just hang out with the rest of our community.

---

### Building from sources

Support is not provided for setting up build environments or compiling the mod. We ask that
users who are looking to get their hands dirty with the code have a basic understanding of compiling Java/Gradle
projects. The basic overview is provided here for those familiar.

#### Requirements

- JRE 8 or newer (for running Gradle)
- JDK 8 (optional)
  - If you neither have JDK 8 available on your shell's path or installed through a supported package manager (such as
[SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io)), Gradle will automatically download a suitable toolchain from the [AdoptOpenJDK project](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
and use it to compile the project. For more information on what package managers are supported and how you can
customize this behavior on a system-wide level, please see [Gradle's Toolchain user guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html).
- Gradle 6.7 or newer (optional)
  - The [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:using_wrapper) is provided in
    this repository can be used instead of installing a suitable version of Gradle yourself. However, if you are building
    many projects, you may prefer to install it yourself through a suitable package manager as to save disk space and to
    avoid many different Gradle daemons sitting around in memory.

#### Building with Gradle

Sodium uses a typical Gradle project structure and can be built by simply running the default `build` task. After Gradle
finishes building the project, you can find the build artifacts (typical mod binaries, and their sources) in
`build/libs`.

**Tip:** If this is a one-off build, and you would prefer the Gradle daemon does not stick around in memory afterwards,
try adding the [`--no-daemon` flag](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon)
to ensure that the daemon is torn down after the build is complete. However, subsequent builds of the project will
[start more slowly](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:why_the_daemon) if the Gradle
daemon is not available to be re-used.


Build artifacts ending in `dev` are outputs containing the sources and compiled classes
before they are remapped into stable intermediary names. If you are working in a developer environment and would
like to add the mod to your game, you should prefer to use the `modRuntime` or `modCompile` configurations provided by
Loom instead of these outputs.

========

MobArena is an arena-style minigame for Spigot-based Minecraft servers


## Getting Started

If you don't want to compile the plugin yourself, grab a release artifact from 
one of these two sites:

- [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/mobarena)
- [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34110/)

The wiki here on Github should have all the information you need to get 
started using the plugin.


## Getting Help

If you run into problems or need help with something, feel free to hop on the
MobArena Discord server to have a chat: [Instant Invite](https://discord.gg/5tnwQvC)

Remember, though, that this communication channel is _idle chat_, which
means you likely won't get a response immediately. It could take anything from
a couple of seconds to a day, but your message _will_ be seen.


## Contributing

[![](https://github.com/itzg/minecraft-server-charts/workflows/Release%20Charts/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/itzg/minecraft-server-charts/actions)

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add itzg https://itzg.github.io/minecraft-server-charts/
```

You can then run `helm search repo itzg` to see the charts.

## Charts

* [minecraft](https://github.com/itzg/minecraft-server-charts/tree/master/charts/minecraft)
* [minecraft-bedrock](https://github.com/itzg/minecraft-server-charts/tree/master/charts/minecraft-bedrock)
* [minecraft-proxy](https://github.com/itzg/minecraft-server-charts/tree/master/charts/minecraft-proxy)

86,agowa338/MinecraftSystemdUnit,,"# MinecraftSystemdUnit
Systemd Unit file for Minecraft Server

## Installation

1. Connect to the server or if you want to run the server on your machine, open a terminal
1. Become root using `su` or `sudo`
    - To validate that you're now root, run `id`
1. Next install the necessary packages 
    ```bash
    apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jre-headless curl screen nano bash grep
    ```
1. Create the `/opt` folder if it doesn't already exist 
    ```bash
    mkdir /opt
    ```
1. Now you need to create the user for the service
    ```bash
    adduser --system --shell /bin/bash --home /opt/minecraft --group minecraft
    chmod +t /opt/minecraft
    ```
1. Create the Systemd Unit file:
    ```bash
    nano /etc/systemd/system/minecraft@.service
    # paste the contents of minecraft@.service
    ```
    or 
    ```bash
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agowa338/MinecraftSystemdUnit/master/minecraft%40.service > /etc/systemd/system/minecraft@.service
    ```

## Setup Instance

Each server has it's own subdirectory of `/opt/minecraft`. This means that when a new server is being added, the following steps need to be followed:

1. Create a subdirectory of `/opt/minecraft` for your Minecraft server, we'll be using `feed-the-beast` as an example
    - It is recommended to use a name which only includes lowercase characters, spaces should be replaced with dashes
    ```bash
    cd /opt/minecraft
    mkdir feed-the-beast
    ```
1. Upload your files to the `/opt/minecraft/feed-the-beast` directory
    - **Note**: All uploaded files should be owned by the `minecraft` user
    ```bash
    chown -R minecraft:minecraft /opt/minecraft/feed-the-beast
    ```
1. Accept the Minecraft server's EULA
    ```bash
    echo 'eula=true' > eula.txt

### RAM allocation

With `minecraft@.service` it's possible to specify the RAM allocation per server. This can be done using a `server.conf` file in the server's directory.

**Example**

```properties
# /opt/minecraft/ftb-beyond/server.conf
MCMINMEM=512M
MCMAXMEM=2048M
```

### Feed the Beast

Some Feed the Beast packs include a `FTBInstall.sh`. This script needs to be executed before starting the server.

```bash
cd /opt/minecraft/ftb-beyond
su -c 'bash /opt/minecraft/ftb-beyond/FTBInstall.sh' minecraft
```

## Usage

### Enable auto-start Minecraft server on boot

```bash
systemctl enable minecraft@ftb-beyond
```

### Disable auto-start Minecraft server on boot

```bash
systemctl disable minecraft@ftb-beyond
```

### Start Minecraft server manually

```bash
systemctl start minecraft@ftb-beyond
```

### Stop Minecraft server manually

```bash
systemctl stop minecraft@ftb-beyond
```

### Connecting to the Minecraft server console

To enter the console, [`screen`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen) is used.

All screen sessions are owned by the `minecraft` user and are prefixed with `mc-`.

```bash
# This will attach to the Minecraft server called `ftb-beyond`
su -c 'screen -r mc-ftb-beyond' minecraft
```

**Note**: To detach (exit) from the session, press <kbd>CTRL + A</kbd> followed by <kbd>D</kbd>.

"
88,AtomicStryker/atomicstrykers-minecraft-mods,Java,"
This violently short readme applies to 1.17 and newer, and only to mods which have been updated to the respective versions of minecraft.
There is outdated/unmaintained mods in the repository also, be aware.

In the respective mod folder, run ""gradlew build"" and verify it succeeds.
If it does not, the mod might lack the basic setup for the newer MC versions, to be done in gradle.build and by replacing the gradle wrapper to one taken from a matching forge MDK.

run ""gradlew genIntellijRuns"" to get IDEA project files for the project, and starting client and server for testing and debugging.

Use Intellij to open the folder or the gradle.build (Open as project).


In the ideal case all that is required to upgrade to a newer MC version is changing the variables ""mcversion"", ""version"" and ""mappings channel:"" and also updating the ""minecraft"" dependency pointing to a relevant forge version. Forge builds can be found here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/

89,Tominous/minecraft.js-1,JavaScript,"# MinecraftJS

MinecraftJS brings the best-selling PC game ""Minecraft"" into the web with the power of javascript.

# Motivation

Having to open an additional app to play a game is sometimes too tiring. Therefore, we thought it'd be interesting to somehow implement Minecraft with javascript, essentially bringing the whole Minecraft game into the web. This not only takes away the tedious process of installing the game, it also brings the entire game to players with a couple clicks.

91,mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader,Java,"# minecraft-world-downloader
A Minecraft world downloader that works by intercepting & decrypting network traffic between the client and the server to read & save chunk data. Chunks can be sent back to the client to extend the render distance.


### Downloads  <a href=""https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest""><img align=""right"" src=""https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/total.svg""></a>
Latest Windows release (GUI): [world-downloader.exe](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.exe)

Cross-platform jar (GUI & command-line): [world-downloader.jar](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.jar)

### [Features](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/wiki/Features)
- Requires no client modifications and as such works with every game client, vanilla or not
- Automatically merge into previous downloads or existing worlds
- Save chests and other inventories by opening them
- Extend the client's render distance by sending chunks downloaded previously back to the client
- Overview map of chunks that have been saved:

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/nSM6mLw.png"" width=""50%"" title=""Example of the GUI showing previously downloaded chunks as white squares, chunks sent from the downloader to the client to extend the render distance in normal colours, and chunks sent by server directly to the client in red."">

### Requirements
- Java 17 or higher
- Minecraft version 1.12.2+ // 1.13.2+ // 1.14.1+ // 1.15.2+ // 1.16.2+ // 1.17+ // 1.18+ // 1.19+

### Basic usage
[Download](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.exe) the latest release and run it. Enter the server address in the address field and press start. Instead of connecting to the server itself, connect to `localhost` in Minecraft to start downloading the world.

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/lpjEdPB.png"">

Additional settings can be changed in the other tabs of the settings window.

If you run into any problems, check the [FAQ](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/wiki/FAQ) page for some common issues. 


### Command-line
[Download](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.jar) the cross-platform `world-downloader.jar` and run it using the command-line:

```
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com
```

Then connect to ```localhost``` in Minecraft to start downloading the world. The world will be saved to the ```world/``` by default.

Other arguments can be specified to change the behaviour of the downloader. For example, render distance extending can be enabled by setting the render distance with `-r [distance]`:
```
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com -r 16
```

#### Options
|  **Parameter** | **Default** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  --server | *required* | Server address |
|  --port | 25565 | Server port |
|  --local-port | 25565 | Port on which the downloader will run. |
|  --output | world | World output directory |
|  --no-gui | | Disable the GUI, useful for running in environments that don't support GUIs. |
| --render-distance | 0 | When larger than the server's render distance, send known chunks back to the client |
|  --mark-unsaved-chunks | true | When enabled, marks unsaved chunks red in the GUI. |
|  --minecraft-dir | %appdata%/.minecraft | Path to your Minecraft installation, used for Mojang authentication |
| --username | *none* | Set your Minecraft username, used instead of the Minecraft path for authentication |
| --token | *none* | Set the Minecraft [access token](https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/wiki/Authentication), used instead of the Minecraft path for authentication |

Additional options are available by running `java -jar world-downloader.jar --help`.

### Running on Linux
To easily download the latest release using the terminal, the following commands can be used:
```
wget https://github.com/mircokroon/minecraft-world-downloader/releases/latest/download/world-downloader.jar
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com
```

When running headless Java, the GUI should be disabled by including the GUI option:
```
java -jar world-downloader.jar -s address.to.server.com --no-gui
```

Some linux distributions may require `-Djdk.gtk.version=2` for the GUI to work:

**This project is no longer actively maintained!**

This project is intended to become a Minecraft Classic clone using HTML 5 technologies, most notably WebGL and WebSockets. No third-party libraries are used, with the exception of glmatrix and socket.io. People who have written similar demos used libraries such as *three.js*, but it is
both foolish and inefficient to use a 3D engine for rendering large amount of blocks.

Screenshots
---------------------

<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/tDzki.png"">![Singleplayer structure](http://i.imgur.com/2qBGy.png)</a>

Structure
---------------------

+ *js/* - Includes the different modules that make up the functionality of WebCraft.
+ *media/* - Contains the graphics resources.
+ *style/* - Contains stylesheets for the HTML front-ends.
+ *singleplayer.html* - The front-end for the singleplayer client.
+ *multiplayer.html* - The front-end for the multiplayer client.
+ *server.js* - The Node.js server code.

Modules
---------------------

The two front-ends invoke the available modules to deliver the components necessary for the gameplay and graphics of either the singleplayer or multiplayer experience. The available modules are listed below.

**Blocks.js**

This is the most *moddable* module, as it contains the structure with the available block materials and their respective properties. It also contains functions invoked by the render class for proper shading and lighting of blocks.

**World.js**

This is the base class, which all other modules depend on. Although it is a very important module, it is also the most passive module. It contains the block structure of the world and exposes functions for manipulating it.

**Physics.js**

This module has strong roots in the world class and simulates the flow of fluid blocks and the gravity of falling blocks at regular intervals. It has no specific parameters and is simply invoked in the game loop to update the world.

**Render.js**

This is the module that takes care of visualizing the block structure in the world class. When a world is assigned to it, it sets up a structure of chunks that are updated when a block changes. These chunks are mostly just fancy Vertex Buffer Objects. As this module takes care of the rendering, it also houses the code that deals with *picking* (getting a block from an x, y position on the screen).

**Player.js**

Finally there is also the module that handles everything related to the player of the game. Surprising, perhaps, is that it also deals with the physics and collision of the player. Less surprising is that it manages the material selector and input and responds to it in an update function, just like the physics module.

**Network.js**

This module makes it easy to synchronize a world between a server and connected clients. It comes with both a *Client* and *Server* class to facilitate all of your networking needs.

Typical game set-up
---------------------

First a new world is created and the block structure is initialised.

	var world = new World( 16, 16, 16 );
	world.createFlatWorld( 6 );

The *6* in *createFlatWorld* here is the line between the ground and the first air layer.

Now that we have a world, we can set up a renderer, which will subsequently divide the world into chunks for rendering.

	var render = new Renderer( ""renderSurface"" );
	render.setWorld( world, 8 );
	render.setPerspective( 60, 0.01, 200 );

The *8* here determines the XYZ size of one chunk. In this case the entire world consists out of 8 chunks.

To finish the code that deals with world management, we create the physics simulator.

	var physics = new Physics();
	physics.setWorld( world );

And finally, we add a local player to the game:

	var player = new Player();
	player.setWorld( world );
	player.setInputCanvas( ""renderSurface"" );
	player.setMaterialSelector( ""materialSelector"" );

That concludes the set-up code. The render loop can be constructed with a timer on a fixed framerate:

	setInterval( function()
	{
		var time = new Date().getTime() / 1000.0;
		
		// Simulate physics
		physics.simulate();
		
		// Update local player
		player.update();
		
		// Build a chunk
		render.buildChunks( 5 );
		
		// Draw world
		render.setCamera( player.getEyePos().toArray(), player.angles );
		render.draw();
		
		while ( new Date().getTime() / 1000 - time < 0.016 );
	}, 1 );

To see how the material selector and canvas can be set-up, have a look at *singleplayer.html* and *style/main.css*. Note that the player and physics modules are entirely optional, so you could just as well use this code as a base for making a Minecraft map viewer on your website.

93,PEXPlugins/PermissionsEx,Java,"# README

## PermissionsEx

PermissionsEx \(PEX \(not the pipe\)\) is a full-service permissions plugin giving in-depth control of permissions for a server. PEX is available for various server and proxy platforms:

* [Bukkit/Spigot/Paper](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/permissionsex) -- [source](platform/bukkit/)
* Sponge -- [source (API 8)](platform/sponge/) / [source (API 7)](platform/sponge7/)
* BungeeCord/Waterfall -- [source](platform/bungee/)
* Velocity -- [source](platform/velocity/)
* Fabric -- [source](platform/fabric/)

💬 Having an issue setting up PEX? Check out our [Discord](https://discord.gg/PHpuzZS)

🐞 Found a bug? File a [bug report](https://github.com/PEXPlugins/PermissionsEx/issues)

⛏ [Development Builds](https://jenkins.addstar.com.au/job/PermissionsEx/lastSuccessfulBuild/)

## Development

Want to access permissions in your plugin? PermissionsEx tries to provide extensive compatibility with native APIs, but sometimes more direct access is needed. In that case, PEX has an extensive API that allows querying any sort of information.

PEX can also be extended to support new platforms or implement new data store formats using just the implementation-agnostic `core` API.

### On Maven

PEX is available in a format that can be retrieved in Maven. Its repository:

```markup
<repository>
    <id>pex-repo</id>
    <url>https://repo.glaremasters.me/repository/permissionsex/</url>
</repository>
```

and its dependency specification is:

```markup
<dependency>
    <groupId>ca.stellardrift.permissionsex</groupId>
    <artifactId>permissionsex-core</artifactId> <!-- replace with -sponge or -bukkit depending on which platform you're using -->
    <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### On Gradle

We work in the Kotlin DSL, but Groovy should be similar.

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven(url = ""https://repo.glaremasters.me/repository/permissionsex/"") {
        name = ""pex-repo""
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation(""ca.stellardrift.permissionsex:permissionsex-core:2.0-SNAPSHOT"")
}
```

## Contributing

PermissionsEx always appreciates well thought-out pull requests for code changes, documentation improvements, and translations. All contributions except those to the Bukkit implementation of PEX must be released under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license. All contributions to PermissionsEx for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper must be provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

We build with Gradle -- a wrapper is provided, to build the project simply run `./gradlew build`. Feel free to run ideas by me in the discord before spending time implementing something that doesn't match my vision for the plugin.

The project is in an **early stage**. Many, many features are unimplemented. We welcome help from anyone willing to contribute!

### Supported Minecraft versions

Feather supports 1.16.5 clients and world saves. We do not currently have plans to support multiple versions at once, but
we may consider this in the future.

### Goals

The Feather project aims to provide a Minecraft server that is _fast_, _modular_, and paired with an ergonomic plugin API.

Our mid-term goal is to make Feather usable on hub and minigame servers. The limited set of gameplay features available in Feather
is not a problem for such servers that require a small subset of vanilla functionality. On the other hand, Feather's modularity
and performance lends itself to these types of servers. Therefore, our current focus is
on building a rich plugin API to enable these use cases.

In the long term, Feather could be used on larger, more survival-like servers, where its performance should allow many players to simultaneously play on the same world requiring very few resources.

### Ecosystem

The Feather ecosystem consists of several repositories:
* [`libcraft`](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/tree/main/libcraft), a set of Rust crates providing Minecraft functionality.
* [`quill`](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/tree/main/quill), our work-in-progress plugin API. Quill plugins are written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. Feather runs them in a sandboxed WebAssembly VM.
* `feather`, the server software built on top of `libcraft` and `quill`.

### Performance

Comparisons to vanilla performance _will_ be extremely misleading, because Feather implements so few features. But if you really want them:

* Feather can handle 1,000,000 entities spawned by a plugin before it starts to max out the CPU. The vanilla server will croak long before then.
* Feather can handle 500 concurrent player connections with each player walking in a random direction.

These results _will_ change after more features are implemented in Feather, so take them with a grain of salt.

Memory usage in Feather is proportional to the number of loaded chunks, not player counts. In the 500 player test, the server uses ~40 MiB of RAM
until the players start to spread out. In the 1,000,000 entities test, it uses 400 MiB of RAM without any chunks loaded.

### Running
We offer precompiled binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS at [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/actions/workflows/main.yml).
NB: Do **NOT** use github releases, they are majorly outdated

To run Feather:
* Extract the downloaded archive.
* Run the binary.
  * On Linux and macOS: `./feather-server` in the server directory
  * On Windows: double-click `feather-server.exe`
  
The server will create a configuration file (`config.toml`) which you can modify.

Feather will generate a world by default. If you want to load a vanilla world,
copy the world save to the server directory under the name ""world"" (by default).

Warning: Feather world persistence is fairly new and will likely cause problems
when attempting to open Feather worlds in vanilla. Do not let Feather touch worlds
you care about unless they have been backed up.

### Compiling
If you are on another platform, compile the server yourself to try it out:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/feather-rs/feather
cd feather
cargo build --release
```

Compiling from source requires the latest stable version of Rust. Older Rust versions may be able
to compile Feather, but they are not guaranteed to keep working.

The server executable will be located in `target/release`.

### Architecture

For contributors, we have a work-in-progress explanation of Feather's architecture [here](docs/architecture.md).

### FAQ

* Is Feather production ready?

Not yet. There are numerous bugs and missing features which have yet to be resolved,
and the codebase has not been tested enough to consider the server production ready.

* How can I contribute?

Check out our [issue tracker](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather/issues) to find out what needs to be worked on. Feel free
to join [our Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/4eYmK69) and ask questions whenever you need. Thanks for your interest in contributing!

* Are there other ways I can help?

Yes! We're always looking for people to test out the server and find bugs. If you find anything that doesn't
seem right to you, please submit an issue on the issue tracker.

<p align=""center"">A Minecraft session token stealer written in Python 3.</p>

**What can I use the session tokens for?** You can use session tokens to hijack accounts (gain access to them without having their password) temporarily, as if they restart their game, their session token will get changed.

This version of the stealer only supports **Windows**.

# Features
 - No local caching
 - Transferring via Discord webhook
 - Steals all stored account's tokens
 - No external Python modules required
 - \[**todo**\] MultiMC support
 - \[**todo**\] Cross-platform support

<br>

# How to use
 1. Create a webhook on your Discord server. I recommend creating a new server.
 2. Change the 'WEBHOOK HERE' variable value to your Discord webhook URL in [token-stealer.py](token-stealer.py)
 3. *(obfuscate the code or install it as a backdoor in an other script.)*
 4. Send the script to your victim and make them run it.

I'm LlmDl, the third lead developer of Towny. I have been managing the Towny project since 2014 and the release of Minecraft 1.8. Prior to me there was the original creator: Shadeness (active 2010-2011,) and the second developer: ElgarL (active 2011-2014.)

I am helped out by the TownyAdvanced team: Articdive, FlagCourier, Warrior and a few other private members. Being open-source Towny has a large list of [Contributors](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/graphs/contributors) who have helped improve the code base over the years as well.

Towny is one of the oldest still-in-development plugins for Minecraft. Shadeness created Towny for the now-defunct server platform called hMod. Shadeness ported Towny to Bukkit and left the project shortly afterwards, returning later to add EnemyWar or as it became known: [FlagWar](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar). Towny is now over 10 years old! 

**Go check out some of the [features](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki#features) Towny has and see why it's still popular for yourself.**

Developers who wish to use the Towny API in their plugins may read [the following instructions on adding Towny via a Maven pom.xml.](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/TownyAPI#getting-started-with-towny-and-your-ide)

___

### Building Towny
If you would like to build from a specific branch yourself, you can do so with either [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) or [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), depending on the age of the branch.

For building, open your terminal / command prompt and navigate to the Towny Directory (either extracted, or cloned).

- **Maven**

    - Run `mvn clean package` to generate the plugin in the `target` directory, within the Towny folder. 


- **Ant** (_Deprecated_)

    - For older branches using the Ant build system, the main command to use would be: `ant clean jar`. This command will _exit_ the Towny directory, creating a lib folder alongside it. A Towny.jar file will be generated and placed within there.
    - _Note: As Ant is being deprecated, older branches may eventually not be able to be built against without modification of the `build.xml` file. We leave no guarantee that the file repo providing the dependencies will stay up._

=============

One of the best disguise plugins available, this plugin offers an astounding amount of features due to the unique way it implements its use of disguises!

The commonly accepted method of disguising is turning a pig into a cow, but this takes it a step further and allows you to turn that pig, into a dropped piece of diamond armor!

You can modify each disguise to your own liking through use of the API or commands with full tab completion support and the best part is; All of this is free!

There are a few features which you need to pay for, but none of it is needed to enjoy the plugin to its fullest! For further details, read the plugin's description on SpigotMC. You are required to sign in, but you do not need to purchase the plugin.

## Introduction

CraftTweaker is a Minecraft mod which allows modpacks and servers to customize the game. With CraftTweaker you can change recipes, script events, add new commands and even change item properties! When used with other mods the possibilities become endless! Ranging from custom machine recipes to entirely new blocks and items!

## Feedback

If you're looking for help with the mod, or just want to come hang out, we have a [Discord server](https://discord.blamejared.com).  
If you're running into a bug or have a feature request, please don't be afraid to make an [issue on the tracker](https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker/issues).

## License

Distributed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker/blob/1.19/LICENSE) file for more information.

## Setup

To set up the CraftTweaker development environment you must clone the repo and initialize the submodule.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker.git
```

After the project has been cloned and initialized you can directly import it into your IDE of choice.

## Build

Building the project is as easy as running a Gradle command!
Simply run:
```bash
gradlew build
```
and the outputted `.jar` files will be put in `build/libs/` folder of each subproject (`Common/build/libs/`, `Fabric/build/libs/` and `Forge/build/libs/`).

CraftTweaker also has automated markdown documentation, the output of that will be in the `docsOut/` folder.

## Maven

Every push to this repository is built and published to the [BlameJared](https://maven.blamejared.com) maven, to use these builds in your project, first add the BlameJared maven to your `repositories` block in your build.gradle file like so:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { 
        url = 'https://maven.blamejared.com'
        name = 'BlameJared Maven'
    }
}
```

Then, depending on what modloader you are using, you can use the following snippets, just replace `[VERSION]` with the latest version for each artifact.

### Fabric [![Maven](https://img.shields.io/maven-metadata/v?color=C71A36&label=Latest%20version&logo=Latest%20version&metadataUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmaven.blamejared.com%2Fcom%2Fblamejared%2Fcrafttweaker%2FCraftTweaker-fabric-1.19.2%2Fmaven-metadata.xml&style=flat-square)](https://maven.blamejared.com/com/blamejared/crafttweaker/CraftTweaker-fabric-1.19.2/)

```groovy
dependencies {
    modCompileOnly('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-fabric-1.19.2:[VERSION]')
    // Example:
    // modCompileOnly('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-fabric-1.19.2:10.0.1')
}
```

### Forge [![Maven](https://img.shields.io/maven-metadata/v?color=C71A36&label=Latest%20version&logo=Latest%20version&metadataUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmaven.blamejared.com%2Fcom%2Fblamejared%2Fcrafttweaker%2FCraftTweaker-forge-1.19.2%2Fmaven-metadata.xml&style=flat-square)](https://maven.blamejared.com/com/blamejared/crafttweaker/CraftTweaker-forge-1.19.2/)


```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly(fg.deobf('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-forge-1.19.2:[VERSION]'))
    // Example:
    // compileOnly(fg.deobf('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-forge-1.19.2:10.0.1'))

If you are in a multi-modloader environment (Such as [MultiLoader](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template)), you can bring the Common artifact (code that does not depend on any specific mod loader but rather just the vanilla game) into your Common project like so:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-common-1.19.2:[VERSION]')
    // Example:
    // compileOnly('com.blamejared.crafttweaker:CraftTweaker-common-1.19.2:10.0.1')
}
```

# Guide

## How To Play In Unity?

1. 打开 SinglePlayer 场景
2. 点击播放按钮
3. 根据屏幕上的键位提示进行游戏

## Asset Management

在编辑器下支持两种资源加载模式：

* 从 `AssetDatabase` 加载（适合开发时使用，不需要构建 `AssetBundle`，对资源的修改立即生效）

* 从 `AssetBundle` 文件中加载（适合测试时使用，需要构建 `AssetBundle`）

两种模式只需要在 Unity 菜单栏 `Minecraft-Unity/Assets/Load Mode` 中切换即可，它们共享同一套 API，上层逻辑不需要在意。

代码示例：

```c#
// 首先，确保场景中有挂载 AssetManagerUpdater 组件，并设置了相关属性，或者自己已经手动初始化了 AssetManager.
using Minecraft.Assets; // 全在这个命名空间里.

class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    // 直接保存资源的路径，如：Assets/MyFolder/MyAsset.asset.
    public string AssetPath;

    // 保存资源的“地址”（推荐）.
    // 在 Inspector 中，这个字段和普通的 Object 引用没有任何区别.
    // 内部保存了资源的 GUID，也就是说即使资源位置被移动、名称被修改，引用仍然不会丢失！
    public AssetPtr Asset;

    private IEnumerator Start()
    {
        // 全异步架构.
        // 不需要关心资源具体在哪个 AssetBundle 中.
        AsyncAsset asset = AssetManager.Instance.LoadAsset<GameObject>(Asset); // 也可以用 AssetPath.
        yield return asset; // 等待资源加载完成.

        GameObject go = asset.GetAssetAs<GameObject>(); // 获取具体的对象.

        // do something.

        AssetManager.Instance.Unload(asset); // 卸载资源.（这里也可以用资源的名称来卸载）
    }
}
```

上面的示例只是最基本的使用，更多 API 就请看源码吧（毕竟这个不是重点）。

构建 `AssetBundle`：在 Unity 菜单栏中点击 `Minecraft-Unity/Assets/Build AssetBundles` 就行了，会自动打包为当前发布平台的资源包，然后放到指定路径。



## Configuration

方块数据、物品数据（暂时还没用）、生物群系数据都在一个自定义的编辑器中进行配置。

在 Unity 菜单栏中点击 `Minecraft-Unity/MC Config Editor` 即可打开，界面如下图：



![编辑器-方块](EditorRecordings/mc_config_editor_block.png)



![编辑器-物品](EditorRecordings/mc_config_editor_item.png)



![编辑器-生物群系](EditorRecordings/mc_config_editor_biome.png)



### Tips

1. 工具栏左边的下拉菜单可以切换当前编辑的数据（Blocks / Items / Biomes）
2. 点击工具栏上的 加号 或者 减号 可以 添加 或者 删除 一个数据项（Block / Item）
3. 工具栏右侧从左往右分别是：搜索框、保存按钮、设置按钮
4. 点击设置按钮可以修改配置文件的保存路径，在一开始用的时候记得先把保存路径设置好
5. 我做好的配置文件都保存在：`Assets/Minecraft Default PBR Resources/Tables/Configs`
6. 如果你不想另起炉灶的话，在刚打开这个编辑器后就把路径设置为第5条中的路径
7. 保存的配置文件有一大坨，其中文件名前加了 `[editor]` 的都是只在 Unity Editor 下使用的
8. 如果想知道第7条中提到的文件有啥作用的话，请看源码吧，这里空间太小，我写不下（费马行为）
9. 如果还有啥问题就提个 issue 问我吧，我想不出来了



## Lua Codes

Lua 代码我都放在了 `Assets/Minecraft Default PBR Resources/Lua Scripts` 路径下。其中 `main.lua` 作为 Lua 代码的 Entry Point，`cleanup.lua` 用来释放资源。如果想修改这些设置，可以在 Hierarchy 中找到 `Lua Manager` 来修改。

`Minecraft.Lua` 命名空间下提供了 `ILuaCallCSharp`、`ICSharpCallLua`、`IHotfixable` 这些空接口，相信熟悉 xlua 的人马上可以看懂。举个栗子，实现 `ILuaCallCSharp` 这个接口，等于给类打上了 `XLua.LuaCallCSharpAttribute`。



### Write Custom Block Behaviours

首先，创建一个 Lua 文件，然后设置好它的 AssetBundleName。

然后，这里先以沙子为例：

```lua
require ""block"" -- 引入这个模块，这里定义了方块行为的 API
local gravity = require ""blocks.templates.gravity"" -- 引入我提供的一个行为模板，这里用的是重力的模板
sand = create_block_behaviour(gravity) -- 直接继承，完成
-- 注意：sand 这个变量一定要是 global 变量，而且名字要和之前在编辑器配置的名称一致
```

写完以后，别忘记在 `main.lua` 里 `require` 一下。最后再提一下 `block` 这个模块，先看下简短的源码：

```lua
-- 文件路径：Assets/Minecraft Default PBR Resources/Lua Scripts/block.lua

local behaviour = {} -- 默认行为

-- 方块行为被注册时调用
function behaviour:init(world, block)
    self.world = world
    self.__block = block
    print(""init block behaviour: "" .. block.InternalName)
end

-- 边上的方块刷新时调用
function behaviour:tick(x, y, z)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块被放置后调用
function behaviour:place(x, y, z)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块被破坏后调用
function behaviour:destroy(x, y, z)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块被点击后调用
function behaviour:click(x, y, z)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块实体初始化时调用
-- entity 参数就是方块实体对象
-- context 参数就是一个 LuaTable，可以用来保存一些临时数据（切勿直接 self.xxx = xxx）
-- 下同
function behaviour:entity_init(entity, context)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块实体被销毁时调用
function behaviour:entity_destroy(entity, context) 
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块实体的 Update 方法
function behaviour:entity_update(entity, context)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块实体的 FixedUpdate 方法
function behaviour:entity_fixed_update(entity, context)
    -- default implement
end

-- 方块实体被碰撞时调用
-- flags 参数就是 UnityEngine.CollisionFlags
function behaviour:entity_on_collisions(entity, flags, context)
    -- default implement
end

-- 获取该行为对应的 BlockData 对象
function behaviour:get_block_data()
    return self.__block
end

--- 创建一个方块行为对象。
---
--- 如果不传入 `base` 参数，返回的对象将具有默认行为。
---
--- 如果传入 `base` 参数，返回的对象将会继承 `base` 的所有行为。
---
--- @param base? table
--- @return table
function create_block_behaviour(base)
    return setmetatable({
        base = base or behaviour
    }, {
        __index = function(table, key)
            local block = rawget(table, ""__block"")
            return block and block[key] or rawget(table, ""base"")[key]
        end
    })
end
```

这个模块允许我们像定义一个类一样去定义方块行为，非常方便。另外，我提供了 `blocks.templates.gravity` 和 `blocks.templates.fluid` 两种模板，用于快速实现重力和流体的行为。如果要实现更复杂的行为，就要自己写代码了。



## Terrain Generation

在 `Assets/Minecraft Default PBR Resources/WorldGen` 路径下保存了许多地形生成相关的配置文件，可以自己修改参数、增加生成器来改变地形。

如果还有问题就提一个 issue 吧，我看到后会回复的。

Minecraft Server Status Query, written in PHP, with online players, motd, favicon and more server related informations without plugins and enable-query.

*Tested with Spigot 1.9 and Bungeecord 1.9 & 1.8*

### Installation
```
composer require funnyitselmo/minecraftserverstatus
```
### Tutorial
```Java
use MinecraftServerStatus\MinecraftServerStatus;

require '../vendor/autoload.php';

$response = MinecraftServerStatus::query('lostforce.com', 25565);

if (! $response) {
    echo ""The Server is offline!"";
} else {
    echo ""<img width=\""64\"" height=\""64\"" src=\"""" . $response['favicon'] . ""\"" /> <br>
		The Server "" . $response['hostname'] . "" is running on "" . $response['version'] . "" and is online,
		currently are "" . $response['players'] . "" players online
		of a maximum of "" . $response['max_players'] . "". The motd of the server is '"" . $response['description'] . ""'.
		The server has a ping of "" . $response['ping'] . "" milliseconds."";
}
```
If the server is offline MinecraftServerStatus::query returns false else it returns an array which contains the server informations.

### Variables
The following table contains the available variables the response can contain. The default value of each variable is false.

<table border=""0"">
<tr>
<th>Array Index</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>'hostname'</pre></td>

For cracked account, just type the username in `Email` field

## Tips

There are environment variable to override the default value of host, port, username and password
- `MC_BOT_HOST` for the host (String)
- `MC_BOT_PORT` for the port (Integer)
- `MC_BOT_USERNAME` for the email/username (String)
- `MC_BOT_PREMIUM` to specify if the Microsoft Authentication should be used (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_DEBUG` for the debug mode (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_PREFIX` for the prefix of the commands (default=`.`) (String)
- `MC_BOT_AUTO_RECONNECT` for the auto reconnect mode (Boolean)
- `MC_BOT_RECONNECT_DELAY` for the delay before reconnect (Integer)
- `MC_BOT_LANG_FILE` for the language file (default=en_us.json) (String) (File must be in the lang directory at the same level as the jar file)
- `MC_BOT_COMMAND` for the command to execute when the bot is connected (String) (Example: `/say Hello World!`)
- `MC_BOT_COMMAND_DELAY` for the delay before executing the command (default=750ms) (Integer)

They are some builtin commands in the bot

- `difficulty` get the difficulty of the server
- `food` get the food level of the player
- `help` get all the available commands, their description and their usage
- `health` get the health of the player
- `list` get the players connected (Sometimes the packet is glitched, you can use the status button go get the players)
- `pos` get the player position
- `disconnect` disconnect the bot

## Command Line Interface

<p> Like the GUI, the CLI can use commands and send message to the server </p>
<p> Simply type anything in the CLI and type enter</p>

```
 -a,--autoReconnect          Activate auto reconnect
    --cmd <arg>              Set the command that will be executed when
                             the bot is connected
    --cmdDelay <arg>         Set the delay between command execution
                             (Default=750ms)
 -d,--debug                  Activate debug
 -h,--host <arg>             Setup the host value (Default=127.0.0.1)
    --help                   Show this help page
    --langFile <arg>         Set the translation language for Minecraft
                             Message (Default=en_us.json) (Should be the
                             filename, placed in lang directory at the
                             same level as the jar)
 -p,--port <arg>             Setup the port value (Default=25565)
    --premium                If the user need to be logged through
                             Microsoft Authentication
    --reconnectDelay <arg>   Delay before reconnection
 -s,--status                 Display only the status of the server
 -u,--user <arg>             Email/Username of the user
```

## Termux Guide

This project works great with [Termux](https://termux.com/). You can use the CLI to operate from your phone. 
Here, is the guide to run this project on Termux. 

### First-Time Setup

* Download and install Termux from [here](https://termux.com/).
* Run `pkg install openjdk-17 curl jq -y`
* Run ⬇️
```bash
curl -o MinecraftBOT.jar -L $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/alwyn974/MinecraftBOT/releases/latest | jq -r "".assets[0].browser_download_url"")
```

### Starting The Bot

Now you can run the MinecraftBOT, see [CLI Options](https://github.com/alwyn974/MinecraftBOT#command-line-interface)

Example: `java -jar MinecraftBOT.jar --host play.hypixel.net --autoReconnect --user Notch`

### Stopping The Bot

There is some method of stopping the bot in Termux:
- Write `.disconnect` in the CLI (`.` is the default prefix for the commands)
- See the termux notification bar, and close it
- Force Stop the application (not recommanded)

## Dependencies

* Java 8+
* See the [build.gradle](https://github.com/alwyn974/MinecraftBOT/blob/main/build.gradle)

## Documentation

A javadoc is available [here](https://alwyn974.github.io/MinecraftBOT)

# Minecraft Server
**Starter project enabling you a Minecraft Server using just a Raspberry Pi 4 or Jetson Nano.**

This project has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 B 4GB & Nvidia Jetson Nano. I do not recommend using a Raspberry Pi 3 or older. They do not have enough RAM and power to calculate all the things. :boom:

## Why balenaMinecraftServer?

* It works out of the box, just start it, and it just works. :+1:
* You can play anywhere. You can take the Pi to a friend, connect to his Wi-Fi and enjoy playing. :video_game:
* It is free. No costs, no big server and no complication. :free:
* Why host on a computer? A Pi is power efficient! :rocket:
* You can easy maintain the files on the Pi by using your PC. :computer:

## Hardware required

* Raspberry Pi 4B (We recommend the 4GB or the 8GB model. 1GB is not enough!) or Nvidia Jetson Nano
* A fan or cooling system to prevent lag caused by throttling
* A 16GB or greater micro SD Card (We always recommend SanDisk Extreme Pro SD cards)
* Power supply

## Software required

* A download of this project (of course)
* Software to flash an SD card ([balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher))
* A free [balenaCloud](https://balena.io/cloud) account
* The [balena CLI tools](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

## Setup and use :stars:

To run this project is as simple as deploying it to a balenaCloud application; no additional configuration is required.

### Setup the device :cd:

* Sign up for or login to the [balenaCloud dashboard](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com)
* Create an application, selecting the correct device type for your Raspberry Pi
* Add a device to the application, enabling you to download the OS
* Flash the downloaded OS to your SD card with [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher)
* Power up the board and check it's online in the dashboard

### One Click Deployment

You can deploy this server with one click with the button below. Or, you can follow the manual deployment instructions in the next section.

[![](https://balena.io/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/balena-minecraft-server)

### Manually Deploy this application :airplane:

* Install the [balena CLI tools](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
* Login with `balena login`
* Download this project and from the project directory run `balena push <appName>` where `<appName>` is the name you gave your balenaCloud application in the first step.

## Connect to the server :satellite:

Balena Minecraft Server sets automatically your Server hostname to `balenaminecraftserver.local`. It is the address the from your server. You can connect to it like this:

**Note:** The IP address also works.

![Server-IP](images/Server-IP.png)

Now you have a balenaServer :sunglasses::

**NOTE:** This works only in the connected Wifi. If you want to play worldwide click here: https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/balena-server/blob/master/README.md#play-worldwide-optional-earth_americas

![Minecraft Screenshot](images/minecraft-screenshot.png)

## Connect to the terminal :satellite:

The server has no console input option in the cloud dashboard, so you need `RCON`. The port is `25575` and the password is `balena`. It is a protocol for connecting to the server.
There are many clients, but you can pick one here:

* mcrcon: https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon/releases (NOTE: You will need for starting this script this batch file if you are using windows (Just paste it in the unzipped directory.): https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/RCON-Script/blob/master/launch.bat)

* Minecraft Server RCON: https://alexprogrammerde.github.io/Minecraft-Server-RCON.rar

## Connect to the file-directory :satellite:

You can connect to the server and change your serverfiles. I recommend using a tool like [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) or if you are using OSX or a linux distribution you can use [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).  The IP Address to connect to is “balenaminecraftserver” (without the quotes), the protocol to choose is SCP (If you got the choice), the port number is 22, the username is “root” (again, without the quotes) and the password is “balena” (no quotes). The files are in the folder named “serverfiles” at the root directory, you can double click to open that directory and browse the files in there.

**NOTE:** You can also change your SCP password by setting the `SCP_PASSWORD` Environment Variable within balenaCloud.  On the left, simply click on “Device Variables” and then click the “Add Variable” button. Give it a name of `SCP_PASSWORD`, and set the value to your password. 

## Connect to another Wifi :satellite:

balenaMinecraftServer has wifi-connect integrated. You can use it for taking the Pi everywhere. If you want to read more is here the link to the programm: https://github.com/balena-io/wifi-connect (There is explained how it works.) 

## Change hostname
You can change the hostname by defining the DEVICE_HOSTNAME Environment Variable within balenaCloud.

**NOTE:** If you decide to change the hostname, you will have to use your new hostname within Minecraft to connect to the server, instead of `balenaminecraftserver.local`.

## Custom RAM (optional) :link:

Devices like the Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB or the 8GB model have enough RAM to run the server with more RAM (the default value used by balena Minecraft server is 1GB). If you set `RAM` to a value like `2G`, `4G`, or `6G` it will have the specified amount of RAM available.

## Add plugins (optional) :wrench:

balenaMinecraftServer also supports plugins. Just drop the in the plugins folder using [`SCP`](https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/balena-minecraft-server#connect-to-the-file-directory-satellite). The current Minecraft version is `1.16`. You can get your plugins from there(Other work too.): 

* Spigot resources: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/categories/spigot.4/
* Bukkit: https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins

**NOTE:** Before adding the plugin and getting an error look if the plugin supports `1.16`.

## Play worldwide (optional) :earth_americas:

Once you’ve perfected the setup of your server on your local network, you might be interested in unveiling your server to the rest of the world! Here’s how you can enable remote access and allow players to connect via the Internet.

![NO-IP Picture](images/NO-IP.png)

If you’d like to allow friends outside your local network to join your server, you’ll need to set up dynamic DNS (DDNS) to expose your Pi to the outside world. This example uses a service called No-IP, which has a free tier for people who want to try DDNS out, though other options and methods do exist as well. In the case of this example, you will need to: 

* Create an account with [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/sign-up) by visiting their website.
* After creating the account and logging in, create a Hostname (example: balena.serverminecraft.net) by [following their documentation](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/getting-started-with-no-ip-com/).
* Set up Port Forwarding: You will need to route your Minecraft traffic to port 25565 on your Pi. To do this, you will log in to your home router and setup Port Forwarding. This step varies by particular brand of modem or router, but the No-IP documentation does a good job of describing the process [here](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/). You may need to follow instructions specific to your modem or router if the No-IP documentation does not contain your particular type.
* Optional: You can log in to No-IP with your router to keep the IP Address current in case it changes. That allows the router to connect automatically to No-IP. Here is a [guide by No-IP](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/how-to-configure-ddns-in-router/) on how to accomplish this.
* Paste your public / external internet address in the box labeled IP Address into the No-IP dashboard. You're done. 👍

For a deeper look at setting up remote access, please [reference this guide](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/getting-started-with-no-ip-com/) (Note: You can skip the DUC part).

## Custom Server (optional) :eyeglasses:

If you want to customize your server even further, but don't know where to start, take a look at some server software listed here:

* Spigot (Vanilla Java Edition): https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot
* Purpur (Vanilla Java Edition, very well optimized for 1.16.3) https://purpur.pl3x.net/
* Vanilla from Minecraft (Vanilla Java Edition): https://getbukkit.org/download/vanilla
* Paper (Vanilla Java Edition): https://papermc.io/downloads
* Forge (Modded Java Edition): http://files.minecraftforge.net/
* ccSpigot (Vanilla Java Edition, Fork and continuation of Paper 1.12.2): https://github.com/moom0o/ccSpigot

Note: Balena Minecraft Server uses Paper. It is an efficient and powerful server. It is compatible with spigot and bukkit plugins.

If you want to use a different Minecraft Sever .jar, add a variable called `JAR_FILE`. The value should be the same as your custom .jar file that you placed in the serverfiles directory using SCP.

I encourage you to take your server build even further! There are many tutorials out there on server customization-- this article only touches on a few ideas. If you need help, please reach out by submitting an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/balena-minecraft-server/issues).

This project is in active development so if you have any feature requests or issues please submit them here on GitHub. PRs are welcome, too. :octocat:

Here is a little server demo :crown::

110,MattiBorchers/MinecraftEarthMap,JavaScript,"# Minecraft Earth Map
WorldPainter script and heightmaps for generating an Earth map for Minecraft.

Just run the script ""world.js"" from ""tools"" -> ""Run Script..."" in WorldPainter.
Be sure to change the ""path"" variable to match your folder with the script and files. Be sure to place all images, layers and terrain in the right folders.

The script was tested on an Intel i5-6500 with 32 GB of RAM.

Time / RAM needed to execute the script for 1.12:

1:4000 = 3 min / 2.1 GB RAM

1:2000 = 14 min / 5.7 GB RAM

1:1000 = 62 min / 19.1 GB RAM

## Images
The base of the script are the various images linked above. To determine the right resolution, I referred to Minecraft's region files, which have a size of 512x512 blocks. The final map should be a multiple of 512. The next step in my process was to edit the existing images. For example, the ""Köppen Climate Classification"" image had an original resolution of 43200x21600 pixels. The nearest fit for the map is 43008x21504, so I changed the canvas size (I didn't want to resize the image, otherwise information would be lost. Anti-aliasing is also forbidden since the script assigns a biome to a specific RGB color.)

The same step was made for the Globcover, except the original resolution was 129600x55800, which is not the 2:1 format. That's because Antarctica isn't pictured in this image. At first, I changed the canvas size to 129600x64800 (added the new pixels at the bottom of the existing image), then resized the image to 43200x21600 pixels (this is exact 1/3) without resampling (again, we don't want anti-aliasing) and then changed the canvas again to match 43008x21504.

For the heightmaps, I combined the surface elevation and the bathymetry images from NASA, which had a resolutions of 21600x10800. At first, I resized the images to 43200x21600, this time with resampling (Bicubic interpolation), so we get smoother mountains. Later, I also used a blur effect for more realistic elevation in Minecraft.

A lot of the images from ""shadedrelief.com"" had to be resized from 16200x8100 pixels and be applied a posterize effect afterwards, because layers are only applied or not applied. 1 or 0, black or white.

For the street data I used QGIS3 to export the images.

In summary, each image has an original resolution of 43200x21600 and is then cut to 43008x21504 (even on all sides).

Source: https://github.com/Morlok8k/MinecraftLandGenerator

-----------------------------------------------

This program lets you generate an area of land with your Minecraft SMP server (and is prossibly future-proof for newer versions). You set up your java command line and minecraft server paths in the MinecraftLandGenerator.conf file, set up the server's server.properties file with the name of the world you wish to use, and then run this program.
When a Minecraft server is launched, it automatically generates chunks within a square area of 25x25 chunks (400x400 blocks), centered on the current spawn point (formally 20x20 chunks, 320x320 blocks). When provided X and Z ranges as arguments, this program will launch the server repeatedly, editing the level.dat file between sessions, to generate large amounts of land without players having to explore them. The generated land will have about the X and Z ranges as requested by the arguments, though it will not be exact due to the spawn point typically not on the border of a chunk. (Because of this, MLG by default adds a slight overlap with each pass - 380x380 blocks) You can use the -x and -z switches to override the spawn offset and center the land generation on a different point.
The program makes a backup of level.dat as level_backup.dat before editing, and restores the backup at the end. In the event that a level_backup.dat file already exists, the program will refuse to proceed, leaving the user to determine why the level_backup.dat file exists and whether they would rather restore it or delete it, which must be done manually.

This program is free, and the source code is included in the .jar file.  (If accidently missing, like in 1.3.0 and 1.4.0, it is always available at Github.)

- pr0f1x: Added a 40 second wait before shutting down.
- Morlok8k: Made 40 second wait optional.
- Morlok8k: Changed the Dimensions code.  (I had assumed it would be DIM-1, DIM-2, etc.  but it turned out to be DIM-1 and DIM1. Change reflects Server output of ""Level n"")
- Morlok8k: Config file is automatically updated to reflect these changes.
- Morlok8k: Cleaned up code.

1.5.0
- Supports Server Beta 1.6.4 (& hopefully future versions as well, while remaining backward compatible.)

- Added world specific output for 9 dimensions (DIM-1 is the Nether, DIM-2 through DIM-9 dont exist yet, but if and when they do, you can configure it's text).  (""Level 0"", the default world, is displayed as the worlds name)
- Updated Config File for these Dimensions.
- Reads and outputs the Seed to the output. (If you had used text for the Seed, Minecraft converts it into a number. This outputs the number.)
- Changed the default 300 blocks to 380.  The server now makes a 400x400 square block terrain instead of 320x320.  Thus it is faster because there are less loops.  To use the old way, use ""-i300""
- Added total Percentage done (technically, it displays the % done once the server finishes...)
- Added debugging output vars of conf file (disabled - need to re-compile source to activate)

		+ (the goal is to have MLG be configureable, so it can work on any version of the server, past or present.)

*** 1.4.5 (pre 1.5.0) ***
- sorry!  I shouldn't release untested code...
*************************

1.4.4
- Added ablilty to ignore [WARNING] and [SEVERE] errors with ""-w""

1.4.3
- Fixed ""-ps"",""-printspawn"" as I had forgot I had broken it in 1.4.0 - due to config file change.

1.4.2
- No New Features
- Changed non-verbose mode to display server progress on the same line, saving a lot of space.
	- This couldn't wait for 1.5.0 ...  I (Morlok8k) liked it too much.

1.4.0
- Future Proofing
- Configurble Server Message reading. (If server updates and breaks MLG, you can add the new text!)
- Updated config file, and auto updating from old format.
- Added % of spawn area to non-verbose output.
- Removed datetime stamps from server output in verbose mode
- Other Misc fixes.

1.3.0
- Fixed Problems with Minecraft Beta 1.3 -- Morlok8k

-----------------------------------------------

Corrodias:
1.2.0
- land generation now centers on the spawn point instead of [0, 0]
- the server is launched once before the spawn point is changed, to verify that it can run and to create a world if one doesn't exist
- added -printspawn [-ps] switch to print the current spawn coordinates to the console
- added -x and -y switches to override the X and Y offsets
- added -v switch, does the same as -verbose
- improved status message spacing to make things easier to read
- improved time estimation algorithm: it now averages the last 3 launches

1.1.0
- added MinecraftLandGenerator.conf file to hold the java command line and the server path
- added -conf solo switch to generate a .conf file
- added -verbose switch to output server output to the console (default is to ignore it)
- added -i switch to allow customizing the block increment size (default is 300)
- added instructions output in this version, i think
- improved status message output to include current iteration and total iterations

1.0.0
- initial release

-----------------------------------------------

Notes:
Due to changes in server beta 1.6, it now generates the nether as well as the world at the same time.
However, Since beta 1.9 and Minecraft 1.0, the nether or the end is no longer generated.
The ""Server Generation Fix Mod"" by Morlok8k can generate The Nether and The End.  Link: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1378775-

I recommend using MCEDIT to relight the map after you generate it. This will take a long time, but should fix all those incorrectly dark spots in your level.

#Issues
This mod is no longer under active development. I (lehjr) no longer have access to upload any new versions of MPS. Furthermore, a recent openJDK8 update killed the development environment for 1.12.2, and there will be no support from Forge to fix this. Lastly, all effort is going into Modular Power Armor, a successor to MPS. https://github.com/lehjr/ModularPowerArmor

# Minecraft Prometheus Exporter

A **Bukkit plugin** which exports Minecraft server stats for Prometheus.

If you're running multiple Minecraft servers behind a BungeeCord proxy, you might also be interested in [Bungeecord Prometheus Exporter](https://github.com/weihao/bungeecord-prometheus-exporter) for additional metrics!

## Quick Start

Drop the prometheus-exporter.jar into your Bukkit plugins directory and start your Minecraft server.

After startup, the Prometheus metrics endpoint should be available at ``localhost:9940/metrics`` (assuming localhost is the server hostname).

The metrics port can be customized in the plugin's config.yml (a default config will be created after the first use).

## Plugin config

Here's a default config with annotations.

```yml
# Note that the HTTP server binds to localhost by default.
# If your Prometheus runs on another host or inside a Kubernetes cluster
# set this to any reachable IP or 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces.
host: localhost
# The port can be changed in case it conflicts with any other application.
port: 9940
# Metrics can be enabled individually. Metrics which are disabled
# by default may have a performance impact on your server.
# See the rest of the README for more information.
enable_metrics:
  jvm_threads: true
  jvm_gc: true
  players_total: true
  entities_total: true
  living_entities_total: true
  loaded_chunks_total: true
  jvm_memory: true
  players_online_total: true
  tps: true
  tick_duration_average: true
  tick_duration_median: true
  tick_duration_min: false
  tick_duration_max: true
  player_online: false
  player_statistic: false
```

## Prometheus config

Add the following job to the ``scrape_configs`` section of your Prometheus configuration:

### Single server

```yml
- job_name: 'minecraft'
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9940']
      labels:
        server_name: 'my-awesome-server'
```

### Multiple servers

You can use labels in your Prometheus scrape configuration to distinguish between multiple servers:

```yml
- job_name: 'minecraft'
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9940']
      labels:
        server_name: 'server1'
    - targets: ['localhost:9939']
      labels:
        server_name: 'server2'
```

## Import Grafana Dashboard

1. Navigate to Grafana -> Dashboards -> Import
1. Paste in or upload [minecraft-server-dashboard.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter/master/dashboards/minecraft-server-dashboard.json)
1. Update ""JVM Memory Used"" to reflect your server max memory (Default 8G)
1. Edit (bottom right widget) -> Options -> Gauage -> Max

## Available metrics

These are the stats that are currently exported by the plugin.

Label | Description
------------ | -------------
mc_players_total | Unique players on server (online + offline)
mc_loaded_chunks_total | Chunks loaded per world
mc_players_online_total | Online players per world
mc_entities_total | Entities loaded per world (living + non-living)
mc_villagers_total | Villagers
mc_world_size | World size in bytes
mc_jvm_memory | JVM memory usage
mc_jvm_threads | JVM threads info
mc_tps | Server tickrate (TPS)
mc_tick_duration_median | Median Tick Duration (ns, usually last 100 ticks)
mc_tick_duration_average | Average Tick Duration (ns, usually last 100 ticks)
mc_tick_duration_min | Min Tick Duration (ns, usually last 100 ticks)
mc_tick_duration_max | Max Tick Duration (ns, usually last 100 ticks)

## Player metrics (experimental!)

:warning: **The following feature is against Prometheus best-practices and is not recommended for production servers!**

There is an option to export per-player statistics like the number of blocks mined, mobs killed, items used, etc.
The amount of data stored in Prometheus can dramatically increase when this is enabled as individual time-series
will be generated for each player that has ever been seen on the server. The statistic collection may also have an
impact on the Minecraft server performance for bigger servers but it has not been measured or tested.

On the other hand this should be quite safe for small private servers with limited players.

You can enable the experimental player export in the config.yaml.

```yaml
enable_metrics:
  player_online: true
  player_statistic: true
```

This will enable the additional metrics.

Label | Description
------------ | -------------
mc_player_statistic | Player statistics
mc_player_online | Online state by player name

There's a sample [dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter/master/dashboards/minecraft-players-dashboard.json)
available to get you started.

## Collect metrics about your own plugin

You can easily collect metrics about your own plugin.

### Include the Prometheus dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.prometheus</groupId>
    <artifactId>simpleclient_common</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
</dependency>
```

### Collect metrics

This pseudo code shows how you would count invocations of a plugin command.

```java
public class MyPluginCommand extends PluginCommand {

  // Register your counter
  private Counter commandCounter = Counter.build()
            .name(""mc_my_plugin_command_invocations_total"")
            .help(""Counter for my plugin command invocations"")
            .register();

  @Override
  public boolean execute​(CommandSender sender, String commandLabel, String[] args) {

    // Increment your counter;
    commandCounter.inc();

    // Do other stuff

    return true;
  }

}
```
### Supported Minecraft Versions
#### Officially supported
1.11 – 1.16

#### Tested

## Dependencies

### For go

- go 1.10+

### For glfw

- On macOS, you need Xcode or Command Line Tools for Xcode (`xcode-select --install`) for required headers and libraries.
- On Ubuntu/Debian-like Linux distributions, you need `libgl1-mesa-dev` and `xorg-dev` packages.
- On CentOS/Fedora-like Linux distributions, you need `libX11-devel libXcursor-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel mesa-libGL-devel libXi-devel` packages.


## Install

`go get github.com/icexin/gocraft`

## Run

Suppose `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` env, use command below to run. 

`cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/icexin/gocraft && gocraft`

## How to play

- W, S, A, D to move around.
- TAB to toggle flying mode.
- SPACE to jump.
- Left and right click to add/remove block.
- E,R to cycle through the blocks.

## Multiplayer

Multiplayer is supported now!

The server code is at https://github.com/icexin/gocraft-server .

You can use `gocraft -s gocraft.icexin.com` to connect the public server.

Since the player on public server is anonymous, be carefull for your work!

If any network error occurs, the game will end with a panic, may changed in the future.

Local cache is saved as `cache_$server.db`, you can use `gocraft -db xxx.db` to offline use.

## Roadmap

- [x] Persistent changed blocks
- [x] Multiplayer support
- [ ] Ambient Occlusion support

## Implementation Details

Many implementations is inspired by https://github.com/fogleman/Craft, thanks for Fogleman's good work!

Multiplayer is implementated used a duplex rpc call, client can call server to update blocks or fetch chunks, server can also push changes to clients.

116,NoCheatPlus/NoCheatPlus,Java,"NoCheatPlus
---------
NoCheatPlus is a fork of the famous anti-cheat plugin [NoCheat](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/nocheat/) created by [Evenprime](https://github.com/Evenprime). NoCheatPlus attempts to enforce ""vanilla Minecraft"" mechanics, as well as preventing players from abusing weaknesses in Minecraft or its protocol, making your server more safe. Organized in different sections, various checks are performed to test players doing, covering a wide range including flying and speeding, fighting hacks, fast block breaking and nukers, inventory hacks, chat spam and other types of malicious behaviour. For a more complete list have a look at the always outdated [Features Page](https://github.com/NoCheatPlus/Docs/wiki/Features).

Installation
---------
* [Install a Spigot server](https://github.com/NoCheatPlus/NoCheatPlus/#obtain-a-build-of-spigot)
* [Download NoCheatPlus](https://github.com/NoCheatPlus/NoCheatPlus/#download)
* Drop the NoCheatPlus.jar in to the plugins folder.
* Start your Spigot/CraftBukkit server. (Using /reload can have unwanted side effects with players still online, but also with complex plugins and cross-plugin dependencies, so we don't recommend it. Usually it should work with NCP.)

Hints
---------
* Be sure that your Spigot/CraftBukkit and NoCheatPlus versions match together. The latest version of NCP is compatible with a wide range of CraftBukkit/Spigot versions ([See the notable builds page for a quick overview.]()).
* Don't use tabs in the config.yml file.
* Use [ProtocolLib](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/protocollib) for full efficiency of the fight checks and other. Using a version of ProtocolLib that is supported by NCP is essential, as otherwise some checks will be disabled.
* For compatibility with other plugins such as mcMMO, citizens and more check out [CompatNoCheatPlus](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/compatnocheatplus-cncp/).

Compiling NoCheatPlus
---------
* NoCheatPlus used to be compiled with java 6 compliance (note OpenJDK, possibly we'll switch to 8 directly, once appropriate, e.g. with ProtocolLib dropping support for 7.).
* We use [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3 to handle the dependencies. Tested both with Eclipse and Jenkins is Maven 3.3.9.
* You can compile with this Maven goal: `mvn clean package`, for a build without any of the ""non free"" modules, which depened on not publicly downloadable resources, such as the CraftBukkit/Spigot server jar - the reflection based compatibility module is still contained. 
* In order to include a pre-built jar with the ""non free"" modules contained, use `-P nonfree_include`.
* To also (re-) build ""non free"" compatibility modules, use `-P nonfree_build` as well as activating the appropriate module to build via a profile such as `-P cbdev` - see the tables below for reference.
* Have a look at the NCPCompatNonFree sub module for reference on how to add custom compatibility modules. If you add custom modules with a different package naming than `fr.neatmonster`, you might have to update the includes section within  NCPCompatNonFreeJar as well. The related factories are located within the NCPPlugin module (e.g. MCAccessFactory).
* ""Non free"" jar file dependencies needed for the dedicated compat modules, which your local maven repository might be missing, can be installed manually.
Example for Eclipse with embedded maven:
Add a new maven build run configuration, name it appropriately, e.g. ```Install CB 1.7.5```.
Set goals to: ```install:install-file -Dfile=<PATH TO JAR> -DgroupId=org.bukkit -DartifactId=craftbukkit -Dversion=1.7.5-R0.1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar```
On Windows the <PATH TO JAR> might look like:  ```X:\...\craftbukkit\3042\craftbukkit-1.7.5-R0.1-20140408.020329-16.jar```
To let it run you might have to set the base directory, e.g. to ```${workspace_loc}```, it does not seem to have significance.
Do set the correct version alongside the file name. On newer version of maven, you might do with much simplified goals, because the pom files inside the jars are parsed.
  * **The latest versions of BuildTools.jar will automatically install the created server jars into the local .m2 repository (e.g. on linux) - provided configuration paths are standard. Thus you don't need to do this manually anymore, if you then build NCP with the specific profile, if you have run BuildTools.jar to generate the server jars on that machine/environment.**

Options and profiles related to enabling/disabling including/building ""non free"" compatibility modules.

| Profile | Parameter | Description |
| :------------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- |
| `-P nonfree_include` | _none_ | The ""non free"" modules are included via a pre-built jar file from the repository. |
| `-P nonfree_build` | _none_ | Enable building ""non free"" compatibility modules. The NCPCompatNonFree jar file is built/installed/(deployed). |
| _none_ | _none_ | The ""non free"" modules are neither built, nor included via a pre-built jar file. |

Profiles for choice of ""non free"" compatibility modules to build:

| Profile | Description |
| :------------------ | :-------------- |
| _none_ | Default build without any of the native access modules, might pose compatibility issues with latest Minecraft versions. The reflection based module is included here. |
| `-P all` | All compatibility modules. |
| `-P cbdev` | The latest version in development. |
| `-P spigot1_12_r1` | Spigot 1.12 R1 (MC 1.12-1.12.2). |
| `-P spigot1_11_r1` | Spigot 1.11 R1 (MC 1.11-1.11.2). |
| `-P spigot1_10_r1` | Spigot 1.10 R1 (MC 1.10-1.10.2). |
| `-P spigot1_9_r2` | Spigot 1.9 R2 (MC 1.9.4). |
| `-P spigot1_8_r3` | Spigot 1.8 R3 (MC 1.8.4-1.8.8). |
| `-P spigot1_7_r4` | Spigot 1.7 R4 (MC 1.7.10). |
| `-P cblegacy` | The pre-DMCA CraftBukkit builds. |

(On the long run, only the latest module for a major Minecraft release may be be kept, such as 1_8_r3 for all of 1.8.x.)

Minecraft Python Client Library!

This projects aims to be a modern, Python3-compatible, well-documented library for
communication with a MineCraft server.

Detailed information for developers can be found here:
`<http://pycraft.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

``start.py`` is a basic example of a headless client using the library
Use ``start.py --help`` for the options.

Supported Minecraft versions
----------------------------
pyCraft is compatible with the following Minecraft releases:

* 1.8, 1.8.1, 1.8.2, 1.8.3, 1.8.4, 1.8.5, 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.8.8, 1.8.9
* 1.9, 1.9.1, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 1.9.4
* 1.10, 1.10.1, 1.10.2
* 1.11, 1.11.1, 1.11.2
* 1.12, 1.12.1, 1.12.2
* 1.13, 1.13.1, 1.13.2
* 1.14, 1.14.1, 1.14.2, 1.14.3, 1.14.4
* 1.15, 1.15.1, 1.15.2
* 1.16, 1.16.1, 1.16.2, 1.16.3, 1.16.4, 1.16.5
* 1.17, 1.17.1
* 1.18, 1.18.1

In addition, some development snapshots and pre-release versions are supported:
`<minecraft/__init__.py>`_ contains a full list of supported Minecraft versions
and corresponding protocol version numbers.

Supported functionality
-----------------------
Although pyCraft is compatible any supported server, only a subset of all
packets are currently decoded or encoded by the library: those necessary
to remain connected to the server, those used for chat, and some others.

Developers wishing to use other functionality with pyCraft can contribute by
implementing packet classes for the desired packets, adding them under
`<minecraft/networking/packets>`_, and sending a pull request.

Supported Python versions
-------------------------
pyCraft is compatible with (at least) the following Python implementations:

* Python 3.5
* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8
* Python 3.9
* PyPy

Requirements
------------
- `cryptography <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography#cryptography>`_
- `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`_
- `PyNBT <https://github.com/TkTech/PyNBT>`_

The requirements are also stored in ``setup.py``

See the installation instructions for the cryptography library here: `<https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/>`_
but essentially ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` should cover everything.

For those interested in developement, you can also visit #forestry-dev.

### Building

You may want to adjust the ""./gradle.properties"" file to set your mc account as needed.

To setup, open a command line and run ""gradlew setupDecompWorkspace"". Then run the following depending on your IDE:

Eclipse: ""gradlew eclipse""
IntelliJ IDEA: ""gradlew idea genIntellijRuns""

To package, open a command line and type ""gradlew build"".

For mod authors: the Forestry maven is located at http://maven.ic2.player.to/net/sengir/forestry/

### Notes

Beware of ugly code.

Bugfixes are generally welcome. If you want to contribute something which changes game mechanics, please talk to someone with commit privileges first. Nothing is more frustrating than putting a lot of work and effort into a new game mechanic and then having the PR rejected because it doesn’t fit gameplay-wise.

**If you submit a PR you must accept the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/ForestryMC/ForestryMC). There is no way around that, since otherwise changing the license later - even to something more permissive! - , becomes close to impossible.**

### Setup

#### What's needed
- Internet connection
- At least 4gb of ram
- Java JDK (1.8)
- Java JRE (1.8)
- An IDE (The setup is for Eclipse, but MCP can also be setup on [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtMhtp6QQoY))

#### Video!
Now a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSKu_zhPKc8) is available, showing how to set up the client. - The video is not up to date and a step is missing. Until that is updated you can watch that video and then come back and do the last step (adding javaws to your build path)

#### Let's get started
_Note: the instructions in italic apply ONLY to Eclipse, if you have a different IDE, [search how to set the project up on Google](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+setup+Minecraft+Coders+Pack+in+%5BMY+IDE%5D)_

- Download [Minecraft Coders Pack 918 (1.8.8)](http://www.modcoderpack.com/files/mcp918.zip) _(or MCP)_
- Unzip the MCP into a folder and enter it
- Double click the ""decompile"" bat file inside of the folder and wait for the assets to be copied
- When the message ""== Decompiling client using fernflower =="" pops up inside of the terminal you can close the window (there is no need to actually decompile the MCP)
- Download the project as ZIP
- Enter the ""src"" folder
- Delete the ""minecraft"" folder, if any is present
- Copy the folder ""minecraft"" from the project's ZIP into the ""src"" folder
- _Launch Eclipse into the ""eclipse"" folder (that is inside the folder you decompiled the MCP in) as workspace_
- Optionally delete the Server project (it is safe to do so)
- _Optionally enable the @formatting tags (Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter -> Edit -> Expand ""Off/On tags"" -> Tick the ""Enable Off/On tags"" -> Change the Profile Name (or you will not be able to save) -> OK -> Apply and Close)_
- Change the JRE version from JRE1\_6 to JRE1\_8 _(Right click on ""Client"" -> Build Path -> Libraries -> Scroll to the bottom -> Double click ""JRE System"" -> Choose a JRE1\_8 -> Finish -> Apply and Close)_
- Add the javaws.jar to your project buildpath (the file is located here: ""JAVA_PATH\jre1.8.0_VERSION\lib\javaws.jar"", where ""JAVA_PATH"" is where your java is installed (""C:\Program Files\Java\"", or ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\"" for 64-bit computers, is the default path on Windows) and ""VERSION"" is the java version you have installed.

"
124,mcedit/pymclevel,Python,"Python library for reading Minecraft levels.

Can read Alpha levels, Indev levels, and Creative levels (with help).

Includes a command-line client (mce.py)

Requires numpy and PyYaml.

Read mclevel.py to get started.

See LICENSE.txt for licensing terms.



mce.py is a command-line editor for SMP maps. It can be used interactively from a terminal, accept editing commands on standard input, or run a single editing command from the shell.

Sample usage:

$ python mce.py

    Usage:

    Block commands:
        clone <sourcePoint> <sourceSize> <destPoint>
        fill <blockType> [ <point> <size> ]
        replace <blockType> [with] <newBlockType> [ <point> <size> ]

        export <filename> <sourcePoint> <sourceSize>
        import <filename> <destPoint>

        analyze

    Player commands:
        player [ <player> [ <point> ] ]
        spawn [ <point> ]

    Entity commands:
        removeEntities [ <EntityID> ]

    Chunk commands:
        createChunks <point> <size>
        deleteChunks <point> <size>
        prune <point> <size>
        relight [ <point> <size> ]

    World commands:
        degrief

    Editor commands:
        save
        reload
        load <filename> | <world number>
        quit

    Informational:
        blocks [ <block name> | <block ID> ]
        help [ <command> ]

    Points and sizes are space-separated triplets of numbers ordered X Y Z.
    X is position north-south, increasing southward.
    Y is position up-down, increasing upward.
    Z is position east-west, increasing westward.

    A player's name can be used as a point - it will use the
    position of the player's head. Use the keyword 'delta' after
    the name to specify a point near the player.

    Example:
       codewarrior delta 0 5 0

    This refers to a point 5 blocks above codewarrior's head.

126,jacobwgillespie/heroku-minecraft,CoffeeScript,"# Heroku Minecraft

#### Minecraft finds a way.

This is a very alpha-quality Heroku app that runs a Minecraft server on a single dyno.

#### Limitations

Since Heroku is a bit of a weird platform, there are a couple of caveats to running a Minecraft server on it.

* Since Heroku no longer supports TCP routing, we're proxying the connection through WebSockets. This means each client will have to run a little tool to turn the WebSocket connection back into a regular TCP Minecraft connection. This is detailed below in the ""Client"" section.

* Heroku has no persistant storage, so you will have to have an [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com) account and an Amazon S3 bucket ready to store your world data. Your world data will be automatically synced to and from S3 in the background.

## Server Setup

1. Clone this repository using git (or, if it's easier, [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com), or [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com)).

2. Create a new Heroku app with a custom buildpack.

   ```bash
   $ heroku create my-app-name --buildpack https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git
   ```

3. Choose your Minecraft server version (default 1.8.3).

   ```bash
   $ heroku config:add MC_VERSION=1.8.3
   ```

4. Add your Amazon AWS credentials and S3 bucket name to the Heroku configuration. This enables data persistence. Otherwise, your server will be wiped each time it is restarted.

   ```bash
   $ heroku config:add AWS_KEY=xxxxxxx AWS_SECRET=yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy S3_BUCKET=my-bucket-name
   ```

5. Push the app to Heroku.

   ```bash
   $ git push heroku master
   ```

## Client Setup

Install https://github.com/leonardosantos/hmwtc, then:

   ```bash
   $ hmwtc my-app-name.herokuapp.com
   ```

## Credits

Original implementation by [Jacob Gillespie](https://github.com/jacobwgillespie).

#### [English](https://github.com/dotnetGame/MineCase/blob/master/README.md) | [中文](https://github.com/dotnetGame/MineCase/blob/master/README-zh.md) 

`MineCase` 是一个跨平台、分布式的 `Minecraft` 服务器。

本项目使用 `.NET Core` 编写，基于 [orleans](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans) 框架。它通过 Actor 模型将各个模块分离开来，从而构建一个高效的分布式系统。

不同的区块由不同的服务器管理，所有的玩家都可以在同一个世界进行游戏，这位minecraft服务器带来了更多的拓展性。

目前仅支持 `Minecraft`  [1.15.2](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-15-2)的版本。

</h1>

WorldGuard lets you and players guard areas of land against griefers and undesirables, as well as tweak and disable various gameplay features of Minecraft.

* Block creeper and wither block damage, falling damage, etc.
* Disable fire spread, lava fire spread, ice formation, Endermen picking up blocks, etc.
* Blacklist certain items and blocks so they can't be used
* Warn moderators when certain items and blocks are used
* Protect areas of your world so only certain people can build in them
* Set areas where PVP, TNT, mob damage, and other features are disabled
* Protect your server from various 'exploits' like magical obsidian creation machines
* Disable, or enable, various Minecraft features, like sponges from classic
* Add useful commands like an immediate ""STOP ALL FIRE SPREAD"" command
* Enable only features you want! Everything is off by default

WorldGuard is open source and is available under the GNU Lesser
General Public License v3.

A Bukkit server implementation (such as [Paper](https://papermc.io)) and the [WorldEdit plugin](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) are required to use WorldGuard. You can get a release copy of WorldGuard from the [BukkitDev site](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard).

Basically these are [original Malmö missions](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/raw/master/sample_missions/MalmoMissionTable_CurrentTasks_2016_06_14.pdf) with only `<PrioritiseOffscreenRendering>` added to speed up training.

## Installation

1. Install the dependencies for your OS: [Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/blob/master/doc/install_windows.md), [Linux](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/blob/master/doc/install_linux.md), [MacOSX](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/blob/master/doc/install_macosx.md). You can skip Torch, Mono and ALE parts.

2. Install [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) and its dependencies.
 ```
pip install gym
```

3. Download and install [minecraft_py](https://github.com/tambetm/minecraft-py).
 ```
git clone https://github.com/tambetm/minecraft-py.git
cd minecraft-py
# NB! `minecraft_py` should be installed to writable user directory, either in virtualenv or with `--user` option.
python setup.py install
```

4. Download and install `gym-minecraft`:

 ```
git clone https://github.com/tambetm/gym-minecraft.git
cd gym-minecraft
python setup.py install
```

 `gym-minecraft` needs `pygame` to render Minecraft screen. It is best to have pygame installed via your system commands, i.e. `sudo apt-get install python-pygame` or `conda install pygame`. Otherwise setup will automatically download and compile `pygame`. This might need some additional dependencies though, see instructions for [Ubuntu](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/CompileUbuntu), [OSX](http://pygame.org/wiki/MacCompile) or [Windows](http://pygame.org/wiki/CompileWindows).

5. Run once following snippet:
 ```
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

import minecraft_py

proc, port = minecraft_py.start()
minecraft_py.stop(proc)
```
 Basically Minecraft downloads and compiles everything on first start, this snippet just starts `minecraft_py` in debug mode, so you can see when Minecraft gets stuck.

## Running

```python
import gym
import gym_minecraft

env = gym.make('MinecraftBasic-v0')
env.init(start_minecraft=True)
env.reset()

done = False
while not done:
        env.render()
        action = env.action_space.sample()
        obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

env.close()
```

NB! Running Minecraft for the first time might take a while as it downloads and compiles itself. Next time the startup time should be shorter, but still around 30 seconds. In active development phase you might want to start one permanent Minecraft process in background and remove `start_minecraft=True`, see [wiki](https://github.com/tambetm/gym-minecraft/wiki/Parallel).

## Overriding default settings

The default settings for environments might not be optimal for you. Luckily you can easily override them using `init()`.

For example to use discrete actions instead of continuous actions:

```python
env = gym.make('MinecraftBasic-v0')
env.init(allowDiscreteMovement=[""move"", ""turn""])
```

To use continuous actions instead of discrete actions:

```python
env = gym.make('MinecraftBasic-v0')
env.init(allowContinuousMovement=[""move"", ""turn""])
```

To use different video resolution:

```python
env = gym.make('MinecraftBasic-v0')
env.init(videoResolution=[40, 30])
```

More documentation about configuration options is in [wiki](https://github.com/tambetm/gym-minecraft/wiki/Configure).

For the full article and guide visit https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-minecraft-server-script-with-startup-service/<br>

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
To get started / install the server type:<br>
<pre>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRemote/RaspberryPiMinecraft/master/SetupMinecraft.sh | bash</pre><br>

<h2>Getting Help</h2>
To get help you may open an issue here or visit my web site at https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-minecraft-server-script-with-startup-service/ which contains lots of comments from myself and users helping each other out!

<h2>Changing Minecraft Server Versions</h2>
If a new version of Minecraft is out and the script hasn't been updated yet you can change it in the SetupMinecraft.sh script.  If you use the command nano SetupMinecraft.sh it will be the first line in the file like this:<br>
<br>
Version=""1.18.1""<br>
AllowLocalCopy=""1""<br>
<br>
Make sure to change AllowLocalCopy=""1"" to tell the script you want to actually run the local copy instead of the latest version.<br>
Note that for this to work the Paper Minecraft server must also have released the latest version or the download will fail.  You can check here: <a href=""https://papermc.io/downloads"">https://papermc.io/downloads</a><br>

<h2>Check Java Version</h2>

<p>Sometimes if you have multiple versions of Java installed the wrong version of Java will be selected as the default.  If the server didn't start check that the right version of Java is selected with this command:</p>
<p>If you get the message ""<em>update-alternatives: error: no alternatives for java</em>"" then you only have one version of Java installed and can skip to the next section.</p>
<p>If you are presented with a list of choices then your machine has multiple versions of Java installed.  It will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>update-alternatives: warning: /etc/alternatives/java has been changed (manually or by a script); switching to manual updates only
There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1101      auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1101      manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1081      manual mode
</code></pre>
<p>You will usually want to just select the newest version of OpenJDK that is listed so you would type 0 and press enter.  In some cases on some platforms you may want to switch to the official Oracle JDK although I strongly recommend sticking with OpenJDK!</p>

<h2>Tested Distributions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi OS - Bullseye/Buster/Stretch</li>
<li>Ubuntu / Ubuntu Server 22.04 / 21.10 / 20.04 (LTS)</li>
<li>Debian 11 Bullseye / Debian 10 Buster / Debian 9 Stretch</li>
<li>Arch Linux</li>
<li>TinkerOS Stretch</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting Note - Oracle Virtual Machines</h2>
A very common problem people have with the Oracle Virtual Machine tutorials out there that typically show you how to use a free VM is that the VM is much more difficult to configure than just about any other product / offering out there.<br>
The symptom you will have is that nobody will be able to connect.<br>
It is because there are several steps you need to take to open the ports on the Oracle VM.  You need to both:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Set the ingress ports (TCP/UDP) in the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) security list</li>
  <li>*and* set the ingress ports in a Network Security Group assigned to your instance</li>
</ul><br>
Both of these settings are typically required before you will be able to connect to your VM instance.  This is purely configuration related and has nothing to do with the script or the Minecraft server itself.<br><br>
I do not recommend this platform due to the configuration difficulty but the people who have gone through the pain of configuring an Oracle VM have had good experiences with it after that point.  Just keep in mind it's going to be a rough ride through the configuration for most people.<br><br>

</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting Note - Hyper-V</h2>
There is a weird bug in Hyper-V that breaks UDP connections on the Minecraft server.  The fix for this is that you have to use a Generation 1 VM with the Legacy LAN network driver.<br>

</ul>
Update_Sudoers
<h3>November 30th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.18 -- make sure you have backups first if you are upgrading from an existing server!</li>
</ul>

<h3>September 15th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to allow OpenJDK 17 which is now the default ""snap""</li>
</ul>

<h3>September 2nd 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to Paper Minecraft Server API v2</li>
</ul>

<h3>August 1st 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a missing -A parameter for a curl command (thanks davie2000, <a href=""https://github.com/TheRemote/RaspberryPiMinecraft/issues/27"">issue #27</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 27th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added PATH variable to scripts to improve compatibility on some distros</li>
<li>Server now fixes permissions upon startup</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 21st 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Switched from wget to curl to fix spacing issues experienced by some users</li>
<li>Added error redirection to crontab line to help diagnose failures during scheduled restarts</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 19th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where SetupMinecraft.sh could throw an error if no Java version was installed</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 17th 2021</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed server name prompt</li>
    <li>Added username missing to fix service issue</li>
    <li>Reduced memory recommendation by 100MB to allow more space for the OS / other processes since newer versions of Minecraft are requiring more memory.  Remember, if you don't leave enough memory for other things the Minecraft server will crash for memory issues, but it's because you set it too high (counterintuitive I know) and didn't leave enough for the OS and it killed your Minecraft server to prevent the entire OS from crashing.</li>
    <li>Added in check to ensure start.sh and other scripts are not being ran as root.  If this happens you have to use sudo screen -r to find the screen and the permissions will be wrong since root isn't the owner of the server files</li>
    <li>If you know you ran the script/server as root (which starts creating files owned by root instead of the regular user) and your server won't start/is wonky run the fixpermissions script from your server folder with ./fixpermissions.sh and it will correct them for you!</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 15th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added safety check for path to server -- please use the default path of ~ if you aren't familiar with fully qualified Linux paths/directories -- you really don't want to change the safe defaults unless you have a really specific need.</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 14th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a issue that was causing backups to not rotate (it should only keep 10).  Thanks Olli</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 8th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.17.1</li>
<li>Update documentation to explain new AllowLocalCopy=""1"" flag.  This flag tells the script not to run the latest online version and to run the local copy.  You want to use this if you are changing the version or making any modifications to the script itself before running it.</li>
<li>Added update.sh convenience script that calls the latest version of SetupMinecraft.sh</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where having an OpenJDK greater than 16 was not triggering the snap configuration (usually only seen on the cutting edge Ubuntu flavors)</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 5th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with SetupMinecraft.sh saving scripts to the home folder instead of the minecraft folder (thanks Ryan A J.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 3rd 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add option to choose a custom directory instead of forcing the home path</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 24th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed installation of OpenJDK above OpenJDK 16 as the Paper Minecraft server is not working with versions higher than 16</li>
<li>If you have a higher version of Java installed use the following command: sudo update-alternatives –config java and select OpenJDK 16</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 19th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>1.17 Release</li>
<li>Make sure you have backups and take copies of your backups and place them outside the Minecraft folder to be 100% safe</li>
<li>Once running the new version you can't go back to the old one without restoring a backup because it writes new stuff in your server the old version doesn't understand and crashes on</li>
<li>As long as you have backups you should be okay!</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 16th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raised minimum OpenJDK requirement to 16 in preparation for the 1.17 Paper Minecraft server release</li>
<li>If a new enough OpenJDK is not available in apt (Raspberry Pi OS is on OpenJDK 11 for example) it will be installed via snapd</li>
<li>If snapd is not installed it will ask you if you want to install it (reboot required) or abort</li>
<li>After the reboot run SetupMinecraft.sh again and it will finish installing OpenJDK 16!  Be patient, it can take some time, even 10-15 minutes on a good connection and longer on a bad one</li>
<li>Sorry for the inconvenience, there isn't an easier way to get it until the Raspberry Pi OS apt repositories are updated!</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 12th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed syntax error (thanks aruthir!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 10th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added OpenJDK 17 and 18 placeholders for prerequisite installations</li>
<li>Added a fallback to the non-headless JRE for platforms that don't offer that metapackage</li>
<li>Paper Minecraft 1.17 is not yet available but should be soon.  If you go to https://papermc.io/api/v1/paper/ and see 1.17 in the list it's available and you can change the version variable at the very top of SetupMinecraft.sh otherwise it hasn't been released yet.  Should be soon!</li>
</ul>

<h3>March 22nd 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lowered amount of recommended memory by a flat 200MB due to so many people having ""Out of Memory"" errors</li>
<li>Note:  Nobody has ever really been ""out of memory"" on the Pi since like the Pi 1.  The problem is you're using TOO MUCH.</li>
<li>If you're getting memory related crashes you need to turn your memory DOWN.  The server will recommend lower amounts going forward.</li>
</ul>

<h3>March 16th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added backup rotation - server keeps the last 10 backups by default</li>
<li>If you want to change the amount of backups held it is located in the ""start.sh"" script with a comment of '# Rotate backups -- keep most recent 10'</li>
<li>This adds a little responsibility for saving really old backups but fixes the issue I and many others have had of the server getting filled with backups and crashing</li>
</ul>

<h3>January 31st 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.16.5</li>
<li>Server now takes ownership of server files on each start to prevent folks a whole heap of trouble and heartache when restoring backups/moving files/etc.</li>
<li>Added check to make sure script isn't being ran as sudo to prevent installing to the /root folder</li>
</ul>

<h3>December 5th 2020</h3>

135,Alpha21016/Minecraft-Digital-Circuit,,"# Minecraft-Digital-Circuit

本项目利用Minecraft游戏中的简单信号元件构建出复杂的组合和时序数字“电路”，通过一种直观的三维可视化方式展示一个较为纯粹的可计算模型。这个模型不需要考虑现实中的晶体管电路所涉及到的电气特性和器件工艺等问题，是一个虚拟的图灵完备的逻辑结构。

在saves目录下包含三个存档

用于教学的存档Digital-Circuit-Basic，里面搭建了常用的从简单到复杂的数字电路结构，该存档适用于Minecraft-1.12版本及以上，我自己用的是1.12.2。
这个存档的元件和模块列表说明在“docs/教学存档单元和模块列表.xlsx”。

我以前的大型作品Alpha21016分为两个存档，一个是最终版演示存档，一个是加减乘除计算器演示存档。
之所以分开是因为最终版的存档里为了让CPU的电路简化，四则运算计算器已经被我废弃了，所以我把很久以前刚建完四则运算计算器时的存档单独列出来。
最终版里包含CPU，特殊函数计算器，显示屏，时钟等电路结构。
这两个存档必须在1.4.7版本打开才能顺利运行，因为这个游戏版本过于古老，如果网上寻找不到可以到知乎上私信我。
如果是自行在别处下载的1.4.7游戏程序，需要额外安装能够加载更多区块的插件，因为游戏中超出视野之外的电路是不会运行的。
尽量保证加载范围/渲染距离能覆盖至少320x320的范围，这需要较强的CPU性能，单核性能较强的双核及以上酷睿处理器最为合适。
这个作品并没有全部完成，在游戏中建造十万门以上的大规模数字电路，后期的维护和调试成本过高，因为时间和精力的原因没有将全部的指令集完成，不过CPU已经具有完整的流水线结构。由于年代久远，当时的很多文档资料已经遗失，所以这个项目的电路阅读起来会很困难，而且运行可能存在一些bug。我重新写了CPU部分的演示和结构文档，配有图片将CPU的各个结构描述了一下。

建议直接看教学存档即可了解Minecraft数字电路比较核心的部分。教学存档里都是单独制作的经过反复调试校验的电路模块，可以视作一套标准单元库，输入输出标识以及功能描述都较为清晰。
另外我使用了一个很有用的第三方工具软件，叫MCEdit，可以方便快捷地编辑游戏存档中的三维结构，使得电路搭建比纯手搭节约了很多时间，下载这个工具可以去MCEdit Unified官网。
关于介绍的文档目前没有写完，日后会继续完善。

注意！！！
所有存档如果存在打开无响应或永久加载中的情况，先重启游戏，将渲染距离调低，然后新开一个空存档，进入空存档后再退出到主界面，之后再加载电路存档就可以正常进入了。但是CPU的存档进入后还需要把渲染距离调整回较大的数值，否则电路无法正常运行，在退出存档前再把渲染距离调小就能保证下次能顺利进入存档。这是游戏程序机制的缺陷，暂时没有更方便的解决办法。

更新记录：

2020-08-03更新：教学存档中增加键盘和显示器模块，详见“教学存档单元和模块列表.xlsx”。

2019-09-28更新：增加文档“异或门和全加器最简结构设计原理”，有详细的基础电路设计思路。教学存档中增加了粘性活塞版的与门。

2019-09-23更新：教学存档中增加部分精简版的基础电路模块，quiz中增加第6个问题，内容是关于建造全加器。

2019-09-22更新：教学存档中增加了quiz模块，里面暂时有5个问题，以后还会增加。我给的参考答案在每个问题旁边的小木屋内，每道题并不一定只有唯一解。

2019-09-20更新：教学存档中增加了部分基础电路模块比如或非门，与非门，RS或非触发器等。完善了模块列表文档，列出了每个电路模块的坐标以便于寻找。

【重要声明】本作品不支持任何公众号和自媒体为了吸引流量而进行夸大事实的改编和转载，不希望被反复炒冷饭。目前我只授权了知乎用户Deftercanda和公众号量子位进行了转载，其他所有改编者和转载者均没有被我本人允许。本作品并没有个别自媒体宣传的那样夸张，只是一个基础的数字电路和计算机组成原理的应用。本作品全部开源，非盈利，所有内容以我本人的文章和存档为准。

136,fogleman/Craft,C,"## Craft

Minecraft clone for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Just a few thousand lines of C using modern OpenGL (shaders). Online multiplayer support is included using a Python-based server.

http://www.michaelfogleman.com/craft/

![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/SH7wcas.png)

### Features

* Simple but nice looking terrain generation using perlin / simplex noise.
* More than 10 types of blocks and more can be added easily.
* Supports plants (grass, flowers, trees, etc.) and transparency (glass).
* Simple clouds in the sky (they don't move).
* Day / night cycles and a textured sky dome.
* World changes persisted in a sqlite3 database.
* Multiplayer support!

### Download

Mac and Windows binaries are available on the website.

http://www.michaelfogleman.com/craft/

See below to run from source.

### Install Dependencies

#### Mac OS X

Download and install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
if you don't already have it. You may use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to simplify
the installation:

    brew install cmake

#### Linux (Ubuntu)

    sudo apt-get install cmake libglew-dev xorg-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
    sudo apt-get build-dep glfw

#### Windows

Download and install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
and [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). Add `C:\MinGW\bin` to your `PATH`.

Download and install [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html) so that
CURL/lib and CURL/include are in your Program Files directory.

Use the following commands in place of the ones described in the next section.

    cmake -G ""MinGW Makefiles""
    mingw32-make

### Compile and Run

Once you have the dependencies (see above), run the following commands in your
terminal.

    git clone https://github.com/fogleman/Craft.git
    cd Craft
    cmake .
    make
    ./craft

### Multiplayer

After many years, craft.michaelfogleman.com has been taken down. See the [Server](#server) section for info on self-hosting.

#### Client

You can connect to a server with command line arguments...

```bash
./craft [HOST [PORT]]
```

Or, with the ""/online"" command in the game itself.
    
    /online [HOST [PORT]]

#### Server

You can run your own server or connect to mine. The server is written in Python
but requires a compiled DLL so it can perform the terrain generation just like
the client.

```bash
gcc -std=c99 -O3 -fPIC -shared -o world -I src -I deps/noise deps/noise/noise.c src/world.c
python server.py [HOST [PORT]]
```

### Implementation Details

#### Terrain Generation

The terrain is generated using Simplex noise - a deterministic noise function seeded based on position. So the world will always be generated the same way in a given location.

The world is split up into 32x32 block chunks in the XZ plane (Y is up). This allows the world to be “infinite” (floating point precision is currently a problem at large X or Z values) and also makes it easier to manage the data. Only visible chunks need to be queried from the database.

#### Rendering

Only exposed faces are rendered. This is an important optimization as the vast majority of blocks are either completely hidden or are only exposing one or two faces. Each chunk records a one-block width overlap for each neighboring chunk so it knows which blocks along its perimeter are exposed.

Only visible chunks are rendered. A naive frustum-culling approach is used to test if a chunk is in the camera’s view. If it is not, it is not rendered. This results in a pretty decent performance improvement as well.

Chunk buffers are completely regenerated when a block is changed in that chunk, instead of trying to update the VBO.

Text is rendered using a bitmap atlas. Each character is rendered onto two triangles forming a 2D rectangle.

“Modern” OpenGL is used - no deprecated, fixed-function pipeline functions are used. Vertex buffer objects are used for position, normal and texture coordinates. Vertex and fragment shaders are used for rendering. Matrix manipulation functions are in matrix.c for translation, rotation, perspective, orthographic, etc. matrices. The 3D models are made up of very simple primitives - mostly cubes and rectangles. These models are generated in code in cube.c.

Transparency in glass blocks and plants (plants don’t take up the full rectangular shape of their triangle primitives) is implemented by discarding magenta-colored pixels in the fragment shader.

#### Database

User changes to the world are stored in a sqlite database. Only the delta is stored, so the default world is generated and then the user changes are applied on top when loading.

The main database table is named “block” and has columns p, q, x, y, z, w. (p, q) identifies the chunk, (x, y, z) identifies the block position and (w) identifies the block type. 0 represents an empty block (air).

In game, the chunks store their blocks in a hash map. An (x, y, z) key maps to a (w) value.

The y-position of blocks are limited to 0 <= y < 256. The upper limit is mainly an artificial limitation to prevent users from building unnecessarily tall structures. Users are not allowed to destroy blocks at y = 0 to avoid falling underneath the world.

#### Multiplayer

Multiplayer mode is implemented using plain-old sockets. A simple, ASCII, line-based protocol is used. Each line is made up of a command code and zero or more comma-separated arguments. The client requests chunks from the server with a simple command: C,p,q,key. “C” means “Chunk” and (p, q) identifies the chunk. The key is used for caching - the server will only send block updates that have been performed since the client last asked for that chunk. Block updates (in realtime or as part of a chunk request) are sent to the client in the format: B,p,q,x,y,z,w. After sending all of the blocks for a requested chunk, the server will send an updated cache key in the format: K,p,q,key. The client will store this key and use it the next time it needs to ask for that chunk. Player positions are sent in the format: P,pid,x,y,z,rx,ry. The pid is the player ID and the rx and ry values indicate the player’s rotation in two different axes. The client interpolates player positions from the past two position updates for smoother animation. The client sends its position to the server at most every 0.1 seconds (less if not moving).

Client-side caching to the sqlite database can be performance intensive when connecting to a server for the first time. For this reason, sqlite writes are performed on a background thread. All writes occur in a transaction for performance. The transaction is committed every 5 seconds as opposed to some logical amount of work completed. A ring / circular buffer is used as a queue for what data is to be written to the database.

In multiplayer mode, players can observe one another in the main view or in a picture-in-picture view. Implementation of the PnP was surprisingly simple - just change the viewport and render the scene again from the other player’s point of view.

#### Collision Testing

Hit testing (what block the user is pointing at) is implemented by scanning a ray from the player’s position outward, following their sight vector. This is not a precise method, so the step rate can be made smaller to be more accurate.

Collision testing simply adjusts the player’s position to remain a certain distance away from any adjacent blocks that are obstacles. (Clouds and plants are not marked as obstacles, so you pass right through them.)

#### Sky Dome

A textured sky dome is used for the sky. The X-coordinate of the texture represents time of day. The Y-values map from the bottom of the sky sphere to the top of the sky sphere. The player is always in the center of the sphere. The fragment shaders for the blocks also sample the sky texture to determine the appropriate fog color to blend with based on the block’s position relative to the backing sky.

#### Ambient Occlusion

Ambient occlusion is implemented as described on this page:

http://0fps.wordpress.com/2013/07/03/ambient-occlusion-for-minecraft-like-worlds/

#### Dependencies

* GLEW is used for managing OpenGL extensions across platforms.
* GLFW is used for cross-platform window management.
* CURL is used for HTTPS / SSL POST for the authentication process.
* lodepng is used for loading PNG textures.
* sqlite3 is used for saving the blocks added / removed by the user.
* tinycthread is used for cross-platform threading.

## Prerequisites
Here is the setup video for Windows 10:

[<img alt = ""Setup: Windows 10"" src = ""https://i.imgur.com/VVQrYbG.png"" width = 25% />](https://youtu.be/lrAIYPlvMZw?list=PL6_bLxRDFzoKjaa3qCGkwR5L_ouSreaVP)

and for Debian-based Linux distros:

The `pyglet` module is a necessary dependency for all episodes, the `nbtlib` & `base36` modules are necessary dependencies for all episodes starting with 11, and the `pyglm` module is necessary for the `community` directory. You can install them with PIP by issuing:

```shell
$ pip install --user pyglet nbtlib base36 pyglm
```

## Running

Run the following command in the directory of any episode to run the result from that episode:

```shell
$ python3 main.py
```

This tutorial requires Python version 3.8 minimum (#56, with only a few changes though, it can run on versions much lower).

## Community

The `community` directory is for experiments & contributions made by other people on the latest tutorial's code (see PR [#29](https://github.com/obiwac/python-minecraft-clone/pull/29)).
It more generally extends the project with functionality I've yet to cover in a tutorial or that I don't intend on covering at all.
Characteristic contributions are contributions which *add* something to the code.
Contributions which *fix* something are still merged on the source of all episodes.

The community has several features and options that can be toggled in `options.py`:
- Render Distance: At what distance (in chunks) should chunks stop being rendered
- FOV: Camera field of view

- Indirect Rendering: Alternative way of rendering that has less overhead but is only supported on devices supporting OpenGL 4.2
- Advanced OpenGL: Rudimentary occlusion culling using hardware occlusion queries, however it is not performant and will cause pipeline stalls and decrease performance on most hardware - mostly for testing if it improves framerate
- Chunk Updates: Chunk updates per chunk every tick - 1 gives the best performance and best framerate, however, as Python is an slow language, 1 may increase chunk building time by an ludicrous amount
- Vsync: Vertical sync, may yield smoother framerate but bigger frame times and input lag
- Max CPU Ahead frames: Number of frames that the CPU can go ahead of a frame before syncing with the GPU by waiting for it to complete the execution of the command buffer, using `glClientWaitSync()`
- Smooth FPS: Legacy CPU/GPU sync by forcing the flushing and completion of command buffer using `glFinish()`, not recommended - similar to setting Max CPU Ahead Frames to 0. Mostly for testing whether it makes any difference with `glClientWaitSync()`

- Smooth lighting: Smoothes the light of each vertex to achieve a linear interpolation of light on each fragment, hence creating a smoother light effect - it also adds ambient occlusion, to simulate light blocked by opaque objects (chunk update/build time will be severely affected by this feature)
- Fancy translucency: Better translucency blending, avoid weird looking artefacts - disable on low-end hardware
- Mipmap (minification filtering): Texture filtering used on higher distances. Default is `GL_NEAREST` (no filtering) (more info in `options.py`)
- Colored lighting: Uses an alternative shader program to achieve a more colored lighting; it aims to look similar to Beta 1.8+ (no performance loss should be incurred)
- Antialiasing: Experimental feature

138,WooMinecraft/WooMinecraft,Java,"# WooMinecraft - Self-hosted Minecraft Donations

[WooMinecraft](http://woominecraft.com) is a free Minecraft Donation plugin for your server that provides a self-hosted solution where you're the boss.  By leveraging a well known eCommerce plugin on the
WordPress side of things, we allow you to specify commands for product variations, general product commands, and resending of donations at any time.   
![WooMinecraft Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WooMinecraft/WooMinecraft/main/src/main/resources/wmc-logo.jpg)

## Config
Your config should look like the below section.
```
# Set this to the desired language file you wish to load.
#
# If your l10n is not available but one is that you know how to speak,consider
# contributing to this plugin at https://github.com/WooMinecraft/WooMinecraft/
lang: ""en""

# This is how often, in seconds, the server will contact your WordPress installation
# to see if there are donations that need made.
update_interval: 1500

# You must set this to your WordPress site URL.  If you installed WordPress in a
# subdirectory, it should point there.
url: ""http://playground.dev""

# If you are having issues with REST, or have disabled pretty permalinks. Set this to false.
# Doing so will use the old /index.php?rest_route=/wmc/v1/server/ base
# Setting this to false will also allow you to set the restBasePath value if you have altered your
# installation in any way.
prettyPermalinks: true

# If your REST API has a custom path base, input it here. 
# NOTE: This is only loaded if prettyPermalinks is set to false.
# Known good URL bases.
# - /wp-json/wmc/v1/server/
# - /index.php?rest_route=/wmc/v1/server/
restBasePath: """"

# This must match the WordPress key in your admin panel for WooMinecraft
# This is a key that YOU set, both needing to be identical in the admin panel
# and in this config file
# For security purposes, you MUST NOT leave this empty.
key: """"

# Allowed worlds the player needs to be in to run the commands.
# Disabled by default!
#whitelist-worlds:
#  - world

# Set to true in order to toggle debug information
debug: false
```

## How does it work?
This bridges the gap between PHP, and Java by leveraging both the bukkit/spigot API ( java ) and the WordPress API with WooCommerce support ( php ). It stores commands
per order, per player, per command ( yes you read that right ) in the WordPress database.  This plugin, either when an op requests it, or on a timer, sends a request to
the WordPress server to check for donations for all online players.

If online players have commands waiting to be processed, then all necessary commands are ran.  There is NO LIMIT to the type of commands you can set, `give`, `i`, `tp`, etc... all commands are ran
by the console sender, and not a player.

## Contributions

As with all Github projects, we encourage our users to contribute, even if it's just a small as [opening an issue](https://github.com/WooMinecraft/WooMinecraft).  Every little bit helps, especially with pre-releases

Backup script for Minecraft servers on Linux. 
Supports servers running in [screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen), [tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux), or with [RCON](https://wiki.vg/RCON) enabled. Supports `tar` file or [`restic`](https://restic.net/) backup backends.

## Features
- Create backups of your world folder
- Manage deletion of old backups
  - ""thin"" - keep last 24 hourly, last 30 daily, and use remaining space for weekly backups
  - ""sequential"" - delete oldest backup
- Works on vanilla (no plugins required)
- Print backup status to the Minecraft chat

## Install
```bash
wget https://github.com/nicolaschan/minecraft-backup/releases/latest/download/backup.sh
chmod +x backup.sh
```

Make sure your system has `tar` and your chosen compression algorithm (`gzip` by default) installed.
If using RCON, you will also need to have the [`xxd`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd) command.

## Usage
```bash
# If connecting with RCON:
./backup.sh -c -i /home/user/server/world -o /mnt/storage/backups -s localhost:25575:secret -w rcon

# If running on screen called ""minecraft"":
./backup.sh -c -i /home/user/server/world -o /mnt/storage/backups -s minecraft

# If running on tmux session 0:
./backup.sh -c -i /home/user/server/world -o /mnt/storage/backups -s 0 -w tmux 

# Using restic (and RCON)
export RESTIC_PASSWORD=""restic-pass-secret"" # your password here
./backup.sh -c -i /home/user/server/world -r /mnt/storage/backups-restic -s localhost:25575:secret -w rcon

# Using Docker and RCON
# You will have to set up networking so that this Docker image can access the RCON server
# In this example, the RCON server hostname is `server-host`
docker run \ 
  -v /home/user/server/world:/mnt/server \
  -v /mnt/storage/backups:/mnt/backups \
  ghcr.io/nicolaschan/minecraft-backup -c -i /mnt/server -o /mnt/backups -s server-host:25575:secret -w rcon
```

This will show chat messages (`-c`) and save a backup of `/home/user/server/world` into `/mnt/storage/backups` using the default thinning deletion policy for old backups.

Command line options:
```text
-a    Compression algorithm (default: gzip)
-c    Enable chat messages
-d    Delete method: thin (default), sequential, none
-e    Compression file extension, exclude leading ""."" (default: gz)
-f    Output file name (default is the timestamp)
-h    Shows this help text
-H    Set hostname for restic backup (restic only)
-i    Input directory (path to world folder, use -i once for each world)
-l    Compression level (default: 3)
-m    Maximum backups to keep, use -1 for unlimited (default: 128)
-o    Output directory
-p    Prefix that shows in Minecraft chat (default: Backup)
-q    Suppress warnings
-r    Restic repo name (if using restic)
-s    Screen name, tmux session name, or hostname:port:password for RCON
-t    Enable lock file (lock file not used by default)
-u    Lock file timeout seconds (empty = unlimited)
-v    Verbose mode
-w    Window manager: screen (default), tmux, RCON
```

### Automate backups with cron
- Edit the crontab with `crontab -e`
- Example for hourly backups:
```
00 * * * * /path/to/backup.sh -c -i /home/user/server/world -o /mnt/storage/backups -s minecraft
```

## Retrieving Backups
Always test your backups! Backups are in the `tar` format and compressed depending on the option you choose. To restore, first decompress if necessary and then extract using tar. You may be able to do this in one command if `tar` supports your compression option, as is the case with `gzip`:

Example:
```bash
mkdir restored-world
cd restored-world
tar -xzvf /path/to/backups/2019-04-09_02-15-01.tar.gz
```

The restored worlds should be inside the `restored-world` directory, possibly nested under the parent directories. Then you can move your restored world to your Minecraft server folder under the proper name and path so the Minecraft server uses it.

### With `restic`
Use [`restic restore`](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/050_restore.html) to restore from backup.

## Why not use `tar` directly?
If you use `tar` while the server is running, you will likely get an error like this because Minecraft autosaves the world periodically:
```
tar: /some/path/here/world/region/r.1.11.mca: file changed as we read it
```
To fix this problem, the backup script disables autosaving with the `save-off` Minecraft command before running `tar` and then re-enables autosaving after `tar` is done. 

## Help
- Make sure the compression algorithm you specify is installed on your system. (zstd is not installed by default)
- Make sure your compression algorithm is in the crontab's PATH
- Make sure cron has permissions for all the files involved and access to the Minecraft server's GNU Screen
- It's surprising how much space backups can take--make sure you have enough empty space
- Do not put trailing `/` in the `SERVER_DIRECTORY` or `BACKUP_DIRECTORY`
- If ""thin"" delete method is behaving weirdly, try emptying your backup directory or switch to ""sequential""

## Known Issues
There is a Minecraft bug [MC-217729](https://bugs.mojang.com/projects/MC/issues/MC-217729) in recent Minecraft server versions that cause them to automatically save the world even after receiving the `save-off` command. Until this is fixed, there is a chance that the backup will fail because the world files are modified by Minecraft in the process of creating the backup. This script will try to detect and report this problem if it does occur.

## Disclaimer
Backups are essential to the integrity of your Minecraft world. You should automate regular backups and **check that your backups work**. It is up to you to make sure that your backups work and that you have a reliable backup policy. 

Some backup tips:
- Drives get corrupted or fail! Backup to a _different_ drive than the one your server is running on, so if your main drive fails then you have backups.
- _Automate_ backups so you never lose too much progress.
- Check that your backups work from time to time.

> This is a python based Minecraft server control tool

MCDReforged (abbreviated as MCDR) is a tool which provides the management ability of the Minecraft server using custom plugin system. It doesn't need to modify or mod the original Minecraft server at all

From in-game calculator, player high-light, to manipulate scoreboard, manage structure file and backup / load backup, you can implement these by using MCDR and related plugins

Great thanks to chino_desu and his [MCDaemon 1.0](https://github.com/kafuuchino-desu/MCDaemon) for the idea of such a cool Minecraft control tool

Contact me on discord: `Fallen_Breath#1215`

## Advantage

- It's running above the server. It doesn't need to modify the server at all which keep everything vanilla
- Hot-reloadable plugin system. You don't need to shut down the server to update the plugins
- Multi platform / server compatibility. Supports vanilla, paper, bungeecord etc. on Linux / Windows

## How it works?

MCDR uses [Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen) to start the server as a sub-process, then it has the ability to control the standard input / out stream of the server

Since the console output of a Minecraft server has a stable format and contains a large amount of useful information about the server, e.g. player chat messages, MCDR is able to parse and analyze the server output, abstract them into different events and dispatch them towards plugins for responding

With the help of Minecraft command system, MCDR can send Minecraft commands via the standard input stream to affect the actual Minecraft server

That's it, you can even think of MCDR as a robot that stares at the server console and can quickly respond to server output and input related commands if you like 

## Plugin

[Here](https://github.com/MCDReforged/PluginCatalogue) is a MCDR plugin collection repository

# MCEdit 2.0

MCEdit 2.0 is the next version of MCEdit, the World Editor for Minecraft. MCEdit allows you to edit every aspect of
a Minecraft world, and to import and export .schematic files created by many programs including WorldEdit and the
original MCEdit 1.x. It is free to use and licensed under the BSD license.

MCEdit 2.0's development is in the alpha stage. Many features may be buggy or missing. To download MCEdit 2.0 anyway, head over to
http://www.mcedit.net/

The rest of this file is of interest to programmers only.

# Getting Started

This guide is written with Windows developers in mind. Linux / OS X developers can read how to install below. 
Windows developers are assumed to be using a unix shell such as the _GIT Bash_ included with the Windows distribution 
of Git.

- Install [Python for Windows v2.7.9](http://www.python.org/downloads/). Edit your PATH environment variable (or your 
.bashrc) to have both the `python27` and `python27\scripts` folders. (by default, `c:\python27;c:\python27\scripts;`)
- Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266). 
This is not needed if you already have MSVC 2008 (Visual Studio 9.0) or the Windows SDK 7.0 
installed, but you probably don't so install it anyway.
- Install virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv` (pip is now included with recent versions of Python)
- Update to the latest setuptools to make sure Cython modules compile: `pip install -U setuptools`
- Create a local clone of the MCEdit sources: `git clone https://github.com/mcedit/mcedit2`
- Using the `bash` shell, change directory to the local clone: `cd mcedit2`
- Create a virtualenv using `virtualenv ENV`
- Activate the virtualenv using `. ENV/scripts/activate`

A virtualenv is created in the local clone directory to keep MCEdit's required libraries isolated from those
installed in the systemwide Python folder. This prevents unpleasant surprises when you update a library 
for another project and later find it isn't compatible with MCEdit.

Now, install the required libraries. 

On Windows, `easy_install` is able to install binary installer packages into a virtualenv. Download each of the following and run `easy_install <module>.exe` while the virtualenv is active. Binary packages for the following are available at Chris Gohlke's page. Download the versions for Python 2.7, and make sure to download the `win32` versions if you installed the 32-bit Python (the default) or the `win-amd64` versions for 64-bit Python.

- [pyside](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#pyside) 
- [pyopengl](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#pyopengl) (be sure to grab `PyOpenGL-accelerate` too.)
- [pywin32](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#pywin32) (for registry access)
- [cython](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#cython) (for building `nbt.pyd`)
- [ipython](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#ipython) (for debugging)
- [pygments](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#pygments) (required by IPython) 
- [numpy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs#numpy) **

Also use _pip_ to install these libraries:

- `pip install arrow` - a date/time class with nice text formatting.
- `pip install pyzmq` - Gohlke's pyzmq builds don't work on Windows XP

**Note that Gohlke's numpy builds use the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) which requires a license to use. If you 
have not purchased an MKL license (it's expensive) then you ***DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO DISTRIBUTE APPS*** built 
with it. I didn't notice any better performance with MKL regardless.

An alternative is to install the official builds of numpy from the [SourceForge Downloads](http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/)
but 64-bit builds are not provided. If you need a 64-bit build of numpy that does not include MKL, you will need to 
build it yourself. Also, the official builds are packed into a ""superpack"" installer which easy_install chokes on. 
Just open the installer in an archiving program like [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) and extract the SSE3 installer, 
then `easy_install` it.

Another alternative to downloading all of the above is to download all the packages 
[from my dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fw8u5f050r1m6lp/AABAYXOEAzmV_nfH0Qj9hUOwa?dl=0). Note that the 
64-bit numpy package is one I built myself, with several facilities (LAPACK, BLAS etc) disabled because I couldn't 
be bothered to find out why MSVC 64-bit chokes on them. MCEdit seems to run fine without them. Install 
`python-2.7.9.msi` first, then install [MSVC++ for Python](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266), 
then virtualenv, and create and activate a virtualenv as above. Install each of the .exe files using `easy_install` 
and make sure to `pip install arrow` too.

Once all of the requirements are met, install MCEdit itself into the virtualenv. This will build `nbt.pyd`, ensure 
both `mcedit2` and `mceditlib` are on the pythonpath, and also create an `mcedit2` script making it easy to launch 
the app. 

`python setup.py develop`

All that's left is to see if the app launches.

`mcedit2`

As a bonus, you can use the `-debug` flag to enable the Debug menu and a few extra widgets.

`mcedit2 -debug`

## Linux/OS X (not tested fully)

    cd (Your mcedit2 location)
    virtualenv ENV
    . ENV/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop
    mcedit2

If your distro packages python3 as the default version of python instead of python2, you will probably want to set your virtualenv to use python2, i.e.

    virtualenv -p python2 ENV

If you get a `Library not loaded: libpyside-python2.7.1.2.dylib` error, try running `pyside_postinstall.py -install` to fix this. 

If after that, you get a `Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui` error after that, try installing `qt` using a package manager like Homebrew or apt-get or similar equivalent on your distribution.   You may also need `libxslt-dev` and `python-dev` packages installed before the commands above will work.

Example: `brew install qt` etc. or:

    sudo apt-get install qt-sdk
    sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev
    sudo apt-get install python-dev

_Note: This information is not fully tested and might not work for you_

# Troubleshooting

- `python setup.py develop` or `build` produces the error `cannot find vcvarsall.bat` or similar.
Old version of setuptools don't know about MSVC++ for Python 2.7. Run `pip install --upgrade setuptools` to upgrade.

- When running mcedit2, `ImportError: cannot import name nbt` is produced.
The extension module `nbt.pyd` failed to build. Run `python setup.py develop` to rebuild it and look for any errors.
 The most likely error is the `vcvarsall.bat` error above.
 
- When running mcedit2, `ImportError: %1 is not a valid Win32 application` is produced.
This happens when switching between 32-bit and 64-bit Pythons on Windows. The `nbt.pyx` must be rebuilt after 
switching, so run `python setup.py develop` again.

#### Set Up Java
The Java JDK is used to compile this project.

1. Download and install the Java JDK.
	* [Windows/Mac download link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).  Scroll down, accept the `Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for Java SE`, and download it (if you have a 64-bit OS, please download the 64-bit version).
	* Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below.  If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).
		* Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin`
		* Archlinux: `pacman -S jdk7-openjdk`
		* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk`
		* Fedora: `yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk`
2. Windows: Set environment variables for the JDK.
    * Go to `Control Panel\System and Security\System`, and click on `Advanced System Settings` on the left-hand side.
    * Click on `Environment Variables`.
    * Under `System Variables`, click `New`.
    * For `Variable Name`, input `JAVA_HOME`.
    * For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51` EXACTLY AS SHOWN (*or wherever your Java JDK installation is*), and click `Ok`.
    * Scroll down to a variable named `Path`, and double-click on it.
    * Append `;%JAVA_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `Ok`.  Make sure the location is correct; double-check just to make sure.
3. Open up your command line and run `javac`.  If it spews out a bunch of possible options and the usage, then you're good to go.

#### Set Up Git
Git is used to clone this repository and update your local copy.

1. Download and install Git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/).
	* *Optional*: Download and install a Git GUI client, such as SourceTree, Github for Windows/Mac, TortoiseGit, etc.  A nice list is available [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

#### Set Up This Project
This section assumes that you're using the command-line version of Git.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Set up ```ossrhUsername``` and ```ossrhPassword``` per [this](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html#credentials). If you to not have a sonatype.org account, just set these to anything.
2. Navigate to a place where you want to download this project (eg `C:\Github\Development\`) by executing `cd [folder location]`.  This location is known as `mcdev` from now on.
3. Execute `git clone git@github.com:ExtrabiomesXL/ExtrabiomesXL.git`.  This will download this project into a folder in `mcdev`.
4. Right now, you should have a directory that looks something like:

***
	mcdev
	\-ExtrabiomesXL
		\-This project's files (should have `build.gradle`, etc.)
***

#### Compile This Project
1. Execute `gradlew build`. If you did everything right, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` will be displayed after it finishes.
    * If you see `BUILD FAILED`, check the error output (it should be right around `BUILD FAILED`), fix everything (if possible), and try again.
3. Navigate to `mcdev\ExtrabiomesXL\build\libs`.
    *  You should see a `.jar` file named `[A.A.AA]ExtrabiomesXL-B.B.jar`, where A.A.AA is the `minecraft_version` value in `build.properties` and B.B is the `mod_version` value in `build.properties`. This is the mod file to be used with Minecraft.
    *  Additionally, you should see two more `.jar` files named `[A.A.AA]ExtrabiomesXL-deobf-B.B.jar` and `[A.A.AA]ExtrabiomesXL-deobf-B.B-src.jar`. These are, respectively, the development modfile and the source code. The development mod file can be used when testing mods that are under development.
4. Copy the first jar into your Minecraft mods folder, and you are done!

#### Update Your Repository
In order to get the most up-to-date builds, you'll have to periodically update your local repository and recompile this project.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to `mcdev/ExtrabiomesXL` in the console.
3. Make sure you have not made any changes to the local repository, or else there might be issues with Git.
	* If you have, try reverting them to the status that they were when you last updated your repository.
4. Execute `git pull master`.  This pulls all commits from the official repository that do not yet exist on your local repository and updates it.

Creating modpacks with this launcher is super easy: :one: only drag & drop of configs and mods into a folder, :two: ZERO! scary XML/JSON files to edit, and :three: there's a nice interface for creating modpacks (command-line is also available).

The launcher has all standard features that you'd expect like :one: resume of incomplete downloads, :two: incremental updates, and :three: file deduplication (saves disk space when you have files duplicated between updates or modpacks).

LiteLoader, Forge, Fabric, and custom .jar mods are supported. You can put resource packs in, or really even random mod files that don't go in the configs or mods folder.

You do need some sort of website, but it does **not** need anything complicated like PHP.

For those technically inclined, you can generate modpacks from Git (or any VCS) using your favorite continuous integration server, and then dynamically create modpacks even down to one per branch or tag.

Best of all, our launcher is Minecraft's oldest surviving modpack launcher platform. :thumbsup:

## Getting Started

You'll probably need a few hours to get everything working. Fortunately, we have a [detailed wiki](https://github.com/SKCraft/Launcher/wiki) with screenshots for every step, intended for someone with minimal technical experience.

For your evaluation, there are sample files provided that you will be able to upload to your site to see if it even works for you.

## Pretty Pictures

If you are going to create modpacks with our GUI tool, you'll be seeing this beaut:

![Modpack Creator](readme/pack_manager.png)

![Modpack Creator](readme/modpack_creator.png)

![Build Modpacks](readme/packages_generator.png)

Making a modpack is just drag and drop into a folder like this:

* src/**config**/
* src/**mods**/
* src/**resourcepacks**/
* loaders/

LiteLoader and Forge installers, or Fabric Loader, go into the *loaders* folder. :ok_hand:

### More Pictures

There's a dark version of the launcher (personally not the creator's cup of tea) that you can use:

![Skinned](readme/launcher_skinned.png)

Users can select optional mods/features:

The launcher can update itself and you can use it in portable mode too.

## Notes

* After changing your skin on [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/profile) it can take up to 1 hour for the facial avatar or skin preview to show the new skin.
* The skin preview differenciates between the Steve (4 pixel arm width) and Alex skin (3 pixel arm width) by checking the alpha value on the pixel at 54, 20. Therefore, the preview assumes that the skin is well formed and that the unallocated areas are transparent.
* Default skins: [Steve](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/steve.png) and [Alex](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/alex.png)
* Skin templates: [Steve](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/4px_reference.png) and [Alex](http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/3px_reference.png)

* Please go to our Discord server linked above for the newest info on compilation of this project. 

Note: you need git installed to do the following:
```
git clone --recursive
```
You need a git submodule for the project to compile.
If you don't yet have the submodule but already cloned the repository:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To get latest version of the submodule:
```
git submodule update --recursive --remote
```

### Compiling the mod
Note: on windows you need to run these commands without `./`

This command:
```
./gradlew build
```
Should be enough to build the mod, but if there are any issues, run `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` before `./gradlew build`.
The mod uses information from git repository to generate version number. Make sure you have the git repository before compiling.

### Setting up development environment
Note: on windows you need to run these commands without `./`

![IntelliJ IDEA](intellij-logo.png)

Run:
```
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```
then import it as gradle project into IDEA (if you already have something open, use File->new->project from existing sources)
Then run:
```
./gradlew genIntellijRuns
```
To be able to run the mod from within IDE. Then edit the generated run configurations and set `use classpath of module` to `CubicChunkc_main`
Then refresh gradle project in IDEA.

For development in IntelliJ IDEA the [MinecraftDev plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/8327-minecraft-development) is recommended.


#### Other IDEs:

Importing cubic chunks should be the same as any other Forge mod. If the IDE has gradle integration, import the mod as gradle project after setting
 up development environment.
 
To run this mod from your IDE you need to add at least the following JVM option:
```
-Dfml.coreMods.load=cubicchunks.asm.CubicChunksCoreMod
```

If you use a different IDE and know how to setup development environment in that IDEs - submit pull request adding that information to this file.

Some other useful options:

`-Dmixin.debug.verbose=true` - enable mixin verbose output
`-Dmixin.debug.export=true` - export classes after applying mixins to `run/.mixin.out/`, useful for debugging mixins
`-Dcubicchunks.debug=true` - enable cubic chunks debug options
`-XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow` - some parts of cubic chunks code cause fast throw hen they fail, use when you see exception with no stacktrace
`-Dmixin.checks.interfaces=true` - check that mixin classes implement all interface methods
`-Dfml.noGrab=false` - can be useful for debugging client on some systems, disables hiding mouse cursor

156,gnembon/scarpet,Python,
157,Macuyiko/minecraft-python,Java,"# Minecraft Server Python Interpreter

`minecraft-python` is a Spigot plugin providing the ability to control Minecraft using Python. Contrary to other approaches, this project aims to expose the whole Bukkit API to Python, instead of only providing a few commands by hardcoding or wrapping these in a Spigot plugin.

More background information on how this project came to be can be found on [this blog post](http://blog.macuyiko.com/post/2015/rebuilding-our-jython-console-plugin-for-minecraft.html) (a bit outdated at the moment).

You can watch a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JfwS5hNlw) video showing off some of the possibilities (also a bit outdated by now but gets the idea across).

## Implementation

The implementation is based on Jython. This has the benefit that the complete Python interpreter system runs inside of the JVM, but comes with the drawback that it only supports Python 2.

With the Jython based system, you have the ability to interact with a Jython interpreter through a telnet server, websocket server, and through chat commands (`/py`, `/pyload` and `/pyrestart`). `/py <code>` runs a line of Python code on a Jython interpreter (each player gets their own interpreter instance). A `.` (dot) at the beginning of the `<code>` line can be used in case indentation with whitespace needs to be provided (the Minecraft server removes whitespace so this is provided as a workaround). `/pyrestart` restarts the Jython interpreter. `/pyload <file>` takes a local Python file (in the running directory or on the Desktop of the server) and executes it in the Jython interpreter.

Alternatively, `remote-client.py` can be used to set up a Python REPL that will send commands to the remote Jython interpreter over a websocket connection.

A Telnet client can be used to connect to a telnet-based interface to the remote interpreter.

A built-in Python module, `mcapi.py`, provides some predefined handy commands which can be imported in the remote interpreter. Putting `.py` files in a `python-plugins` directory runs these as ""plugins"" when starting up the plugin. This interpreter keeps running and can be used to set up global hooks. Other interpreters will be cleaned out after some period of inactivity.

### A Word on Python 3

Jython only supports Python 2 for now, and it seems it'll remain that way for a long while longer. There are various Python 3 <-> JVM interop projects available, though none of which seem to offer the ease-of-use of a full Python on JVM implementation as Jython does.

[Py4j](https://www.py4j.org/) comes close, and an earlier commit did provide a way to interact with Minecraft using this library. However, the Py4J implementation relies heavily on callbacks between Python and a JVM, which are sent over the network. Combining this with lots of thread-juggling and Spigot's internal thread model is daunting. The implementation worked, but was very unstable when trying to perform lots of actions on the Spigot server, so I ultimately removed it from the code base for now. See [this commit](https://github.com/Macuyiko/minecraft-python/tree/168656681a2eb8472b9dbd9b00fea276ac4f6f5d) to get an idea where things ended up -- I might add this back in in a separate branch later on.

## Comparison

The explicit goal of this project is to allow programming Minecraft using Python and to provide the full Bukkit API in this environment without resorting to manually wrapping these through a Spigot plugin. Other interesting projects in this space are:

* https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft: modern, Python3-compatible, well-documented library for communication with a MineCraft server. This is on the networking level, however, and rather low-level.
* https://github.com/r1chardj0n3s/pycode-minecraft: similar to command blocks, this plugin allows to code scripts on ""Python Blocks"". Also uses Jython internally.
* http://www.computercraft.info/: an amazing project adding computers and more to Minecraft, provind a coding interface using Lua. This is all in-game, however, comparable to command blocks or `pycode-minecraft`. A fine way to work with computers in Minecraft, though less so to work with Minecraft in computers.
* https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi: combines https://github.com/py3minepi/py3minepi and https://github.com/martinohanlon/minecraft-stuff. Exposes only some basic commands by sending them over the wire to a Minecraft: Pi Edition server. 
* https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice: a plugin that implements the Minecraft Pi Edition API, so that `mcpi` above can be used together with a normal Minecraft server. https://github.com/wensheng/JuicyRaspberryPie extends this a little bit. https://www.nostarch.com/programwithminecraft uses `RaspberryJuice` + `mcpi` to write its examples. A nice approach, with the downside that many ""cool"" Spigot commands are not available (fireworks, spawning, explosions, ...).
* http://scriptcraftjs.org/: similar approach, but uses JavaScript and adds more boilerplate code between the JS engine <-> Java interaction. A bit out of date, sadly.

## Setup

As of its latest version, the plugin is installed just like any other Spigot plugin. **You'll need Java 8 at least.**

On boot, `lib-common` and `python` directories will be created automatically. If you want to access other Minecraft plugins in your Python scripts, their JAR files can be copied over to a `lib-custom` directory.

## Example

Below is a short example of what you can do with the interpreter:

	# Import some modules
	from mcapi import *
	from time import sleep
	from random import randint

	MY_NAME = ""Macuyiko""

	# Note: all code runs asynchronously by default. If you want to make world edits, Spigot
	# forces you to execute these on a synchronised task. Most of the methods included in mcapi
	# will take care of this automatically

	# Set the time to sundawn
	time(0)

	# Zap the point where I'm looking at
	bolt(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)))

	# A small explosion instead
	explosion(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)), power=2)

	# Generate a tree (only works if there is room)
	tree(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)))

	# Spawn some particles
	particle(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)))

	# Spawn an entity (chicken by default)
	spawn(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)))

	# Fireworks
	fireworks(lookingat(player(MY_NAME)))

	# Let's create an exploding chicken spell

	def exploding_chicken(player_name):
	    yell(""Creating an exploding chicken"")
	    chicken = spawn(lookingat(player(player_name)))
	    for i in range(5,0,-1):
	        yell(""%s second(s) left..."" % i)
	        sleep(1)
	    explosion(location(chicken), power=2)
		
		
	# Try it!
	exploding_chicken(MY_NAME)

	# Now let's define a command for this spell
	# Command functions take a special form func(caller, params)

	@asynchronous()
	def cmd_explode_spell(caller, params):
		exploding_chicken(caller.getName())

	# Commands are executed synchronously by Spigot
	# This means that all actions in exploding_chicken would use the state of the 
	# world as it was at the current server tick when executing the command,
	# hence, we use the @asynchronous() decorator to force this function to be 
	# ran asynchronously, only synchronising every time a synchronous command is called

	add_command('chickenspell', cmd_explode_spell)

	# Try typing `/chickenspell` in Minecraft chat window
	# Commands can be unregistered using
	remove_command('chickenspell')

	# Let's register another command to show of the asynchronous workings

	@asynchronous()
	def cmd_growme(caller, params):
	    beginning = lookingat(player(caller.getName()))
	    position = [beginning.x, beginning.y, beginning.z]
	    for i in range(100):
	        setblock(position) # <- will be synchronised
	        position[randint(0,2)] += randint(-1,1)
	        position[1] += +1
	        sleep(0.05)

	add_command('growme', cmd_growme)

	# Now let's register an event
	# These need a func(event) definition

	from org.bukkit.event.block import BlockDamageEvent

	# Almost all events execute synchronised, so again we force them to be asynchronous

	@asynchronous()
	def damage_evt(e):
	    player = e.getPlayer()
	    position = location(player)
	    yell(""I'll count to ten, get out!"")
	    for i in range(10):
	        yell(str(i))
	        sleep(1.0)
	    explosion(position)

	# A block will explode if the player damages it
	listener = add_event_listener(BlockDamageEvent, damage_evt)

	# Remove specific event hook
	remove_event_listener(listener)

	# Or all hooks
	remove_event_listeners()

Plugins works similarly (place this as a `.py` file in a `python-plugins` directory):

	from mcapi import *
	from time import sleep
	from random import randint

	from org.bukkit.event.player import PlayerJoinEvent

	@asynchronous()
	def join_event(e):
	    player = e.getPlayer()
	    player_location = location(player)
	    player_location.y += 20
	    yell(""A chickeny hello to player %s"" % (player.getName(),))
	    for i in range(10):
	        spawn(player_location)

	listener = add_event_listener(PlayerJoinEvent, join_event)

## À propos

Le mode Loup-Garou est un mode inspiré du jeu de société [Les Loups-Garous de Thiercelieux](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Loups-garous_de_Thiercelieux) reprenant son fonctionnement ainsi que sa manière d'être joué, à la seule différence qu'aucun maître du jeu n'est requis, le déroulement de chaque partie étant entièrement automatisé :

- Déroulement de la partie automatisé
- Rôles du jeu de base, et nouveaux rôles
- Utilisable sur n'importe quelle map

## Jouer facilement
Un serveur est mis à votre disposition pour vous permettre de jouer au LoupGarou rapidement et facilement entre amis ou avec des inconnus. Vous avez juste à créer une partie et y inviter vos amis, ou à rejoindre des parties publiques.

**IP:** `lg.leomelki.fr`
**Version:** `1.9.4`

## Installation

### Dépendances requises
- [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/)

### Installation classique
**Minecraft 1.15.1 est requis.**  
Pour installer le plug-in, merci de suivre les étapes suivantes:
  - Téléchargez Spigot 1.15.1 et lancez une fois le serveur
  - Dans le dossier `plugins`, insérez [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) et [LoupGarou.jar](https://github.com/leomelki/LoupGarou/releases)
  - Redémarrez votre serveur puis donnez vous les permissions administrateur (/op <votre_pseudo> dans la console)
  - Allez sur la map et ajoutez les points de spawn sur chaque dalle `/lg addSpawn`
  - Connectez-vous au serveur et choisissez les rôles à utiliser avec `/lg roles set <ROLE> <MONTANT>`
	  - ⚠️ Il faut qu'il y ait autant de places dans les rôles que de joueur pour lancer une partie
  - Vous pouvez démarrer la partie avec `/lg start <pseudo>` 
	  - ⚠️ N'oubliez pas de mettre votre pseudo. Exemple : `/lg start leomelki` 

Lien des releases : [Cliquez ici](https://github.com/leomelki/LoupGarou/releases)


### Installation avec docker (Alternative)

Vous devez avoir installé `docker` et `docker-compose` sur votre machine

#### Installation du serveur
```sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### Démarage du serveur

Vous devez exécuter la commande suivante à chaque redémarage de votre machine avant de pouvoir continuer

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Ainsi, vous pouvez lancer le serveur en utilisant la commande suivante :

```sh
docker-compose exec loup-garou java -jar spigot.jar
```

Les fichiers relatifs à minecraft se situeront dans le dossier `minecraft_data` 
> **Tip :** Il faut accepter les conditions d'utilisations de Mojang en modifiant le fichier `minecraft_data/eula.txt`

## Commandes

`/lg roles` : Retourne la liste des rôles dans la partie  
`/lg roles set <ID> <MONTANT>` : Définit le nombre de joueurs pour un certain rôle  
`/lg addSpawn` : Ajoute un point de spawn (emplacement de joueur)  
`/lg start <PSEUDO>` : Lance la partie  
`/lg end <PSEUDO>` : Arrête une partie  
`/lg reloadConfig` : Recharge la configuration  
`/lg joinAll` : À utiliser après avoir changé les rôles

## Aide

Par soucis de temps, nous ne pouvons pas faire de support au cas par cas, mais vous pouvez rejoindre notre serveur [Discord](https://discord.gg/Squeezie) pour trouver de l'aide auprès de la communauté.

### Questions fréquentes

- Que faire en cas de problème d'affichage (votes bloqués au dessus des têtes, etc...) ?  

Cela arrive après avoir `reload` au cours d'une partie, tous les joueurs qui ont ce problème doivent se déconnecter et se reconnecter.

- Pourquoi la partie ne se lance pas ?  

Il faut taper la commande `/lg start <PSEUDO>` en mettant le pseudo d'un des joueurs qui sera présent dans la partie. Si cela ne fonctionne toujours pas, c'est parce qu'il n'y a pas suffisamment de rôles pour le nombre de joueurs, il doit y avoir le même nombre de rôles qu'il y aura de joueurs dans la partie. N'oubliez pas de taper `/lg joinAll` après avoir modifié la liste des rôles.

- J'ai mal placés mes spawns ou je veux utiliser une nouvelle map, comment faire ?  

Il suffit d'ouvrir le fichier `plugins\LoupGarou\config.yml` et de supprimer les points de spawn.

- Puis-je mettre plusieurs fois le même rôle dans une seule partie ?

Cela est possible pour les rôles `Loup-Garou`, `Villageois` et `Chasseur`.
D'autres rôles peuvent aussi marcher mais n'ont pas été testés avec plusieurs joueurs ayant ce rôle dans une seule partie. C'est à vos risques et périls.

- Le tour du loup noir (ou tout autre type de loup garou) ne passe pas.

Il vous faut au minimum un loup garou normal lorsque vous mettez d'autres types de loups dans la partie.

## Indications pour les développeurs

Ce plugin LoupGarou ayant été modifié de nombreuses fois, parfois dans des timings tendus, le code n'est pas très propre. Aussi, il n'est pas documenté.  

Vous devez utiliser `Lombok` et `Maven` pour modifier ce projet. 
Vous devez aussi installer la repository `Spigot` avec [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/).

**Cependant, si l'envie vous prend de modifier ou d'utiliser le code ici présent en partie, ou dans sa totalité, merci de créditer [Leomelki](https://twitter.com/leomelki) et [Shytoos](https://twitter.com/shytoos_).
Une utilisation commerciale est cependant interdite. Merci de vous référer aux informations de [license](#license)**

### Ajouter des rôles

Ce plugin de Loup-Garou est organisé autour d'un système d'événements, disponibles dans le package `fr.leomelki.loupgarou.events`.  
N'ayant pas le temps de les documenter, vous devriez comprendre vous-même quand ils sont appelés.

Pour vous aider à créer des rôles, copiez des rôles ayant déjà été créés pour ainsi les modifier.

⚠️ Ce projet a été créé de façon à ce que les rôles soient (presque) totalement indépendants du reste du code (LGGame, LGPlayer...).  
Merci de garder cela en tête lors du développement de nouveaux rôles : utilisez un maximum les évènements et, s'il en manque, créez-les !

#### Quelques classes utiles
`LGGame` : Contient le coeur du jeu, à modifier le minimum possible !  
`LGPlayer` : Classe utilisée pour intéragir avec les joueurs et stocker leurs données, à modifier le minimum possible !  
`LGVote` : Système gérant les votes.  
`RoleSort`: Classement de l'apparition des rôles durant la nuit. 

### Publier un rôle

Si vous arrivez à créer un rôle, je vous invite à faire une demande de publication dans cette repo afin de les faire partager à l'ensemble de la communauté !

160,FabricMC/yarn,Java,"# Yarn

Yarn is a set of open, unencumbered Minecraft mappings, free for everyone to use under the Creative Commons Zero license. The intention is to let 
everyone mod Minecraft freely and openly, while also being able to innovate and process the mappings as they see fit.

To see the current version being targeted, check the branch name!

## Usage
To use yarn-deobfuscated Minecraft for Minecraft modding or as a dependency in a Java project, you can use [loom](https://github.com/fabricmc/fabric-loom) Gradle plugin. See [fabric wiki tutorial](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) for more information.

To obtain a deobfuscated Minecraft jar, [`./gradlew mapNamedJar`](#mapNamedJar) will generate a jar named like `<minecraft version>-named.jar`, which can be sent to a decompiler for deobfuscated code.

Please note to run the yarn build script **Java 16** or higher is required!

## Contributing

Please remember that copying and pasting mappings from alternate projects under more restrictive licenses (such as MCP, Spigot's or Mojang's obfuscation maps)
is **completely forbidden** without explicit permission from the owners of said mappings to distribute the names under the CC0 license.
This includes using the names from those mappings for inspiration. Discussing the naming approaches used in said projects
is also not welcome - you have been warned. However, it is a good idea to consult name changes with other people - use pull requests or our community spaces to ask questions!

Please have a look at the [naming conventions](/CONVENTIONS.md) before submitting mappings.

### Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run `./gradlew yarn` (Linux, macOS) or `gradlew yarn` (Windows) to open [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma), a user interface to easily edit the mappings
3. Commit and push your work to your fork
4. Open a pull request with your changes

## Gradle
Yarn uses Gradle to provide a number of utility tasks for working with the mappings.

### `yarn`
Setup and download and launch the latest version of [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma) automatically configured to use the merged jar and the mappings.

Compared to launching Enigma externally, the gradle task adds a name guesser plugin that automatically maps enums and a few constant field names.

### `yarnUnpicked`
Same as above, but unpicks the constants and launches Enigma with them. Can be a little bit slower to get going.

### `yarnCommon`
Same as `yarn`, but will only show common classes.

### `build`
Build a GZip'd archive containing a tiny mapping between official (obfuscated), [intermediary](https://github.com/FabricMC/intermediary), and yarn names (""named"") and packages enigma mappings into a zip archive..

### `mapNamedJar`
Builds a deobfuscated jar with yarn mappings and automapped fields (enums, etc.). Unmapped names will be filled with [intermediary](https://github.com/FabricMC/Intermediary) names.

### `decompileCFR`
Decompile the mapped source code. **Note:** This is not designed to be recompiled.

### `download`
Downloads the client and server Minecraft jars for the current Minecraft version to `.gradle/minecraft`

### `mergeJars`
Merges the client and server jars into one merged jar, located at `VERSION-merged.jar` in the mappings directory where `VERSION` is the current Minecraft version.

## Welcome to GregTech Community Edition
### What is this?
GregTech Community Edition, or **GTCE**, is a Minecraft mod. The repository contains all the code and assets required to build and run that mod.

### GregTech?
Yes, you have probably heard this name before as it is quite known in the Minecraft modding community. GTCE is an **indirect descendant** and **total rewrite** of _**GregTech**_.  It is **neither created nor maintained by GregoriusT** but was created with his knowledge and permission.

This mod is about **technology** and **progression**.
* From simple crude tools which will allow you to process resources more realistically...
* Through **Steam Age** where early machines will help you save some precious resources and open new possibilities...
* To many **Electric Ages** where increasingly complex machines and logistics will become indispensable parts of your industrial regime.

A typical GregTech facility features large arrays of both single- and multi-block machines processing numerous resources, creating even more complex materials which will be used in machines of higher tiers.

All of which are powered by GTCE's own power systems, featuring generators from simple wood burning for steam to plasma-powered turbines.

### Community Edition?
**Community Edition** is a necessary part of the **GTCE name**: 
* It is required by our permission to use the GregTech name
* It is a reminder that the ideas and design are primarily driven by the community
* It is a reminder that the implementation and work are solely provided by the community.

Of course, this does not mean that everyone can add whatever content they want.  But it does mean that the primary maintainers want to listen to the community and take suggestions and ideas to heart when planning or working on any projects.

### Project Goal
To bring preferred GregTech concepts and ideas from GT (Minecraft 1.7.10 versions and earlier) to Minecraft 1.12, targetting a feature-rich, UX-friendly and comprehensive play-through while streamlining and eliminating bloat and make-work details.

Gregtech 5 Unofficial was used as an original base, with some ideas from GT4 and GT6 also incorporated. Many community suggestions have been since applied.

We work with our addon-partners to attempt to preserve backwards-compatibility.

### Release cycle
GTCE follows a two week release cycle (when possible). 
Changelogs are generated and beautified after merging PRs every other Monday. Changelog is then submitted as a Pull Request (PR).
Releases are built and deployed on Tuesdays after merging the Changelog PR.

## Contribution
### Current state of project
GTCE is under active development with regular updates. It is primarily maintained by a ""GTCE Council"" of contributors of various talent: developers, designers and modpack authors. This council is coordinated by @LAGIdiot. The GTCE community is very active and regularly contributes code, testing and ideas.
We are always looking for contributors!

### How to contribute
Remember: Every contribution counts. 
Found a bug? Please let us know by creating an Issue with the bug template. 
Something is missing? Thought about a cool feature idea? Of course there's a template for that.  We'll have a look!
Know how to mod or at least code? Then don't hesitate and jump to Discord channel, contact the Maintainer to discuss possible contribution.
Anything else? Sure come to Discord.

### [教程 · Tutorial](https://go-mc.github.io/tutorial/)

Require Go version: 1.19

There's some library in Go support you to create your Minecraft client or server.  
这是一些Golang库，用于帮助你编写自己的Minecraft客户端或服务器。

- [x] 👍 Minecraft network protocol
- [x] 👍 Robot framework
- [x] 👍 Server framework
- [x] 👍 Dual role RCON protocol (Server & Client)
- [x] 👍 Chat Message (Support both Json and old `§` format)
- [x] 👍 NBT (Based on reflection)
- [x] 👌 SNBT ⇋ NBT
- [x] 👍 Regions & Chunks & Blocks
- [x] ⌛ Yggdrasil (Mojang login)
- [x] ⌛ Realms Server

> We don't promise that API is 100% backward compatible.

## Getting start 

Go-MC tag the old version after new version released. For example, 
if *1.19.3* is the latest Minecraft version, the newest go-mc tag will be *v1.19.2*.
To get the latest Go-MC that support *1.19.3*, usually you must use `go get -u github.com/Tnze/go-mc@master`.
Special cases are version like *1.19*, the Go-MC support it is tagged `v1.19.0` to avoid automatically upgrade. 

Examples:  
To get the latest version: `go get github.com/Tnze/go-mc@master`  
To get old versions (e.g. 1.18.2): `go get github.com/Tnze/go-mc@v1.18.2`
To get the first of each primary version: `go get github.com/Tnze/go-mc@v1.19.0`

### Run Examples

- Run `go run github.com/Tnze/go-mc/cmd/mcping localhost` to ping and list the localhost mc server.
- Run `go run github.com/Tnze/go-mc/cmd/daze` to join the local server at *localhost:25565* as player named Daze on the offline mode.

## Supported Version

As the `go-mc/net` package implements the minecraft network protocol, there is no update between the versions at this
level. So net package actually supports any version. It's just that the ID and content of the package are different
between different versions.

由于`go-mc/net`实现的是MC底层的网络协议，而这个协议在MC更新时其实并不会有改动，MC更新时其实只是包的ID和内容的定义发生了变化，所以net包本身是跨版本的。

163,Footsiefat/Minecraft-Server-Scanner,Python,"# Minecraft-Server-Scanner
Let's you scan the entire internet in a couple of hours and identify all Minecraft servers on IPV4


**Installation:**
```
sudo apt install masscan (Or distro specific installer command)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/master/data/exclude.conf
pip3 install mcstatus
```

**start scanning for servers:**
```
sudo masscan -p25565 0.0.0.0/0 --max-rate <maxrate> --excludefile exclude.conf -oL masscan.txt (Set maxrate to a limit that you are comfortable with and won't melt your router)
```

**find real minecraft servers from the results of the scan:**
```
python mcscanner.py -i masscan.txt -o result.txt -p public.txt
```

###### for more infomation you can always get help by typing ```python mcscanner.py -h```

- For filtering out public servers you can use my public.txt file but it will probably be a bit outdated by now
- Hit enter and wait for my program to check and grab the metadata for all the servers found, once this is done you will have a massive amount of servers (A lot of them being private ones) to have some fun with. The output file includes the IP Address, Version and Current Players online of found servers.

===========

What is this?
-------------

An upcoming mod for Minecraft, based on adding new and fun ways to generate power through big multi-block structures. Don't just plop blocks, design the machines yourself!

For near-future plans and development status, see the Roadmap file.

Big Reactors has an official website at [www.big-reactors.com](http://www.big-reactors.com)

Alpha
--------

Big Reactors is in an alpha state. The major features exist, and there are no _known_ serious bugs. However, it's not fully balanced. I'm only one guy - I can't totally break all the combinations you crazy folks will discover. The internal radiation/power production simulation is very complicated.

You can download the latest alpha from [the big-reactors.com download page](http://www.big-reactors.com/#/download).

_You will need other mods_ to play with Big Reactors. This is just a power-generation mod, so you will need a mod that supports the Redstone Flux (RF) power system. I personally recommend [Thermal Expansion](http://teamcofh.com/thermal-expansion).

License
-------

Licensing for Minecraft mods is silly. If you want to use my mod on your server, in your modpack, whatever, do it, have fun! If you want to use, copy or fork my code, go for it, have fun!

In this guide we will use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as our IDE.
1. Open the project from `File > Open...`
2. Let the IDE collect dependencies and index the code.
3. Goto `File > Project Structure... > SDKs` and make sure an SDK for Java 8 is installed and selected, if not download
   one [here](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot/).

### Gradle build

Test if the environment is set up correctly by building the client and running it inside the IDE using the Gradle tab on the right side of the IDE.
1. Go to `lambda > Tasks > build > runClient` in the Gradle tab and run the client.
2. To build the client as a jar run `lambda > Tasks > build > build`. Gradle will create a new directory called `build`. The final built jar will be in `build/libs`.

Minecraft:Bedrock Edition Unicode characters

## How to use
Copy the unicode character and paste it into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition chats, signs, titles etc.

## How does it work?
Minecraft uses resource packs to assign characters (glyphs) to different unicode values, which is how the game allows you to type in chat and write on signs etc. Because fonts are just textures in a resource pack, it also allows the game to add ""emojis"" which have their own unicode values assign to them just like letters.

## List of all characters

# Thicc Industries Backdoor

A silent, spreading backdoor for Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers.
Using the injector is recommended, should you choose to manually backdoor a plugin, you're on your own if you run into problems.

For educational purposes only. Do not use on a server you do not own.

Read in [Turkish](README.tr.md)

## Requirements:
* Java 8 runtime.
* Desired target plugin jar file.

## GUI Usage:
* Run backdoor-(version).jar.
* Select desired plugin file.
* Input your Minecraft UUID.
* Input chat command prefix. (Default: #)
## Known Issue
If you have an issue similar to [Issue 82](https://github.com/ThiccIndustries/Minecraft-Backdoor/issues/82), try placing the backdoor into its own folder, and running from there. Do not try to run from the Start Menu.
## CLI Usage:
Java -jar backdoor.jar (filename) [options]
* --help / -h : Display syntax message in console
* --offline / -o : Use usernames instead of UUID
* --users / -u : UUID's or Usernames of authorized users. If not used, all users will be allowed.
* --prefix / -p (Default: '#') : Prefix for backdoor commands.
* --discord /-d : Discord webhook url. See Readme.
* --spread / -s : Spread to other plugins.
* --debug / -b : Send debug messages in console. Use this before creating issue reports.

## Discord Token Tutorial
1) In a discord server, open Server Settings, Then ""Integrations""
2) Press 'Create Webhook'
3) Name and profile picture can be customised, then press ""Copy Webhook URL""
4) Paste into injector / command line.

## Commands
Default command prefix is ``#``,  this can be changed.

======

MineOS is a server front-end to ease managing Minecraft administrative tasks.
This iteration using Node.js aims to enhance previous MineOS scripts (Python-based),
by leveraging the event-triggering, asyncronous model of Node.JS and websockets.

This allows the front-end to provide system health, disk and memory usage, and logging in real-time.

This has been tested on Debian, Ubuntu, ArchLinux, and FreeBSD and should work on all variants, Linux or BSD.

Installation
------------

MineOS is distributed through github and downloads its dependencies with npm.

MineOS requires root-privileges, as the authentication relies on the underlying system's /etc/shadow.

Do not install this atop an existing MineOS system (using the Python-based webui), since the installation location is the same /usr/games/minecraft. Following are steps for installing MineOS on an apt-get based distribution, such as Debian or Ubuntu.  These instructions are detailed further (as well as for additional distributions) on the [MineOS wiki](https://minecraft.codeemo.com/mineoswiki/index.php?title=Installing_MineOS).

Using an apt-get based Linux distribution:

    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | bash -
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y nodejs git rdiff-backup screen build-essential openjdk-8-jre-headless
    mkdir -p /usr/games
    cd /usr/games
    git clone https://github.com/hexparrot/mineos-node.git minecraft
    cd minecraft
    chmod +x generate-sslcert.sh
    ./generate-sslcert.sh
    cp mineos.conf /etc/mineos.conf
    npm install
    
For hosts using 'upstart':

    cp /usr/games/minecraft/init/upstart_conf /etc/init/mineos.conf

To use the webui as a background daemon:

    node service.js [start|stop|restart|status]

To start the webui in the foreground:

    node webui.js

Things to watch out for
------

On FreeBSD, you will need to mount a Linux-compatible /proc filesystem, i.e., linprocfs,
at /usr/compat/linux/proc in order for the web-ui to work. In addition, where CLANG is
default for your system, you'll need to build the NPM modules differently:

    echo ""CXX=c++ npm install"" | sh

Mineos-node requires rsync 3.1.x or later, 3.0.x does not have the ability to chown
on copy, which is essential for profiles. Depending on your distribution, you may need
to build it from source.

Developing and Contributing
------

I'd love to get contributions from you! Whether you are most comfortable writing
HTML, CSS, or Javascript (either Nodejs or Angular), feel free to reach out to me about
some of my design goals and we'll see where your efforts can best be used.

177,mtoensing/Docker-Minecraft-PaperMC-Server,Dockerfile,"# Docker Minecraft JAVA PaperMC Server 1.19

Docker Minecraft PaperMC server for 1.19, 1.18, 1.17 for AMD64 and ARM64 platforms. Works on Synology, Raspberry Pi 4 or any other systems that support docker.

[![Build and push](https://github.com/mtoensing/Docker-Minecraft-PaperMC-Server/actions/workflows/dockerimage.yml/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/mtoensing/Docker-Minecraft-PaperMC-Server/actions/workflows/dockerimage.yml)

## Quick Start

```sh
docker run --rm --name mcserver -e MEMORYSIZE='1G' -v /home/joe/mcserver:/data:rw -p 25565:25565 -i marctv/minecraft-papermc-server:latest
```
The server will generate all data including the world and config files in ``/home/joe/mcserver``. Change that to an existing folder.

## How do I update the container? 

### On Synology DSM

* Re-download the image from the docker repository.
* Stop the container.
* Clear the container.
* Start the container.

### On Terminal

```sh
docker pull marctv/minecraft-papermc-server:latest
docker stop mcserver
```

Or just use https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/ 

## Run as non-root user

You can get the desired UID/GID (xxx) with the ID command (id username) then add the following to your docker run command:

```sh
-e PUID=xxx
-e PGID=xxx
```

## Docker Compose

If you prefer to use `docker-compose`, use the following commands:

Start the server:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
Stop the server:
```sh
docker-compose stop
```
Issue server commands after attaching to the container:
```sh
docker attach mcserver
# then you can type things like ""list""
list
# which will show the current players online or
help
# to see all the commands available
```

## How to use the Makefile with Docker Compose 

Additionally, a `Makefile` is provided to easily start, stop, and attach to the container.

```sh
make start     # equivalent to `docker-compose up -d --build`
make stop      # equivalent to `docker-compose stop --rmi all --remove-orphans`
make attach    # equivalent to `docker attach mcserver`
make help      # prints a help message
```

## Environment variables

MEMORYSIZE = 1G

Not more than 70% of your RAM for your container. This is important. Because this is the RAM, your Minecraft Server will use within the container WITHOUT the operating system.

TZ = Europe/Berlin 

Sets the timezone for the container. A list of valid values can be found on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

PAPERMC_FLAGS = --nojline

Sets the command-line flags for PaperMC. Remove `--nojline` if you want to enable color and tab-completion for the server console.

### How-to install on a Raspberry Pi 4

You can install this docker container by using my dedicated installer: https://github.com/mtoensing/RaspberryPiMinecraftDocker Or just follow these steps:

1. Download **Raspberry Pi Imager** https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ and start it.
2. Select Raspberry Pi OS **lite** (64-bit) under ""Raspberry Pi OS (other)"".
3. Click on gear icon in the Raspberry Pi Imager and enable ssh and set username and password.
4. Write image to a fast sd card. 
5. Connect the Raspberry Pi 4 to an ethernet cable.
6. Use putty for Windows or terminal on macOS and connect via ssh:
```sh
ssh pi@raspberrypi
```
7. Upgrade all packages 
```sh
 sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
 sudo reboot now
```
The Raspberry Pi will restart now.

8. Install Docker 
```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
chmod +x get-docker.sh 
./get-docker.sh 
sudo apt-get install -y uidmap
dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo systemctl enable docker
newgrp docker
```
9. New folder for the server
```sh
cd 
mkdir mcserver
```
10. Run this image as Minecraft Server
```sh
docker run -d \
--restart unless-stopped \
--name mcserver \
-e MEMORYSIZE='1G' \
-e PAPERMC_FLAGS='' \
-v /home/pi/mcserver:/data:rw \
-p 25565:25565 \
-it marctv/minecraft-papermc-server:latest
```
The server will generate all data including the world and config files in ``/home/pi/mcserver``.

11. Enter the command line of Minecraft server
```sh
docker attach mcserver
```
Here, you can use Minecraft server commands like ``whitelist add [userrname]``.

"
178,udoprog/c10t,C++,"c10t - a cartography tool for Minecraft
=======================================

I wrote c10t entirely because i liked the tool Cartograph by ZomBuster, but I wasn't too fond of a couple of aspects about how rendering was performed.

Requirements
------------

  * libz (?)
  * libpng (>= 1.2)
  * libfreetype (>= 2)
  * libboost (thread, filesystem, system and test) (>= 1.46)

Features
--------

  * Pipelined rendering process (using image compositioning) which allows for
    multithreaded rendering.
  * Very memory friendly, you can specify a memory limit and it will switch caching to file.
  * Uses proper command line options.
  * Clean code, for easing further development.
  * Multiplatform - yes, it does compile properly on windows and mac.
  * A gui wrapper, see: http://github.com/udoprog/c10t-swt (native gui with java bindings)

I would not have done this were it not for the excellent inspiration by
ZomBuster and Firemark (the linux port of cartograph). Thank you for the
inspiration.

Building from Source (using cmake)
----------------------------------

### Ubuntu ###

 1. Install dependencies:

        $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libpng-dev zlib1g-dev libboost-all-dev libfreetype6-dev

    If libboost >= 1.46 is not available by using your package manager, you need to install it from source. To do so download and untar it from www.boost.org and perform the following operations as root:

        $ ./bootstrap --prefix=/usr
        $ ./b2 install

    If you have troubles installing boost, consult the Getting Started Guide on the website of the boost library.

 2. Clone repository

        $ git clone git://github.com/udoprog/c10t.git
        $ cd c10t

    You need to clone the repository in order to successfully execute the commands in step three. You can get support for git on the following web page:
    http://schacon.github.com/git/gittutorial.html
    Just scroll to the section ""Using git for collaboration"".

 3. Update submodules which contains some required dependencies (./libs):

        $ git submodule init
        $ git submodule update

 4. Run:

        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake ..
        $ make c10t

 * CMake should generate a file called src/config.h from the input file src/config.h.cmake
  
 * There are several targets you can make.  c10t, c10t-lib, c10t-debug, and c10t-test.
   * If you wish to build all of these simply run `make` which defaults to target `all`.
   * If you wish to build any individual one run `make <target>` e.g. `make c10t-test`.

4. The executable `c10t` should be in the current directory.

There are a couple of available targets

 * ___c10t-debug___ - debug build with symbols, nice for debugging
 * ___c10t-lib___ - library that contains all c10t functions not in main or nbt_inspect
 * ___nbt-inspect___ - dumps the content of an nbt data file (basically anything in the world directory). Useful for writing tools.
 * ___region-inspect___ - dumps the content of a mcr region file.

Issues
------

 * Issues should be posted on http://github.com/udoprog/c10t/issues
 * Run the program in debug mode (c10t --debug), this will print useful information, but be much slower.
 * ALWAYS include `c10t --version` information when posting issues, that way it can be determined weither the issue already has been resolved or not, if this information is missing, the issue probably cannot be resolved.
 * ALWAYS include the following information: Platform (e.g. Windows, Linux, Mac) and Architecture (x86, x86_64)
 * IF POSSIBLE include information which can help us reproduce the problem.

179,fnuecke/oc2,Java,"# OpenComputers II

OpenComputers II is a Minecraft mod adding virtual computers to the game. These computers run a virtual machine emulating a 64-Bit RISC-V architecture capable of booting Linux. On top of this, a high-level Lua API is provided to communicate with various devices in the game world. This enables adding virtual devices using a simple, Java-friendly API, without having to implement actual kernel drivers.

This mod is a successor to [OpenComputers]. At least in spirit. While many of the implementation details have changed quite dramatically, the core concepts of customizable hardware, persistence and sand-boxing are shared.

## Gameplay Documentation
For documentation on how the to get computers up and running, and how to use them, see the [documentation]. It is available as a manual item in the game.

## Development Documentation
While the mod isn't quite yet ready for release due to some remaining technical and usability issues, the API should be mostly stable at this point. For most people the high level device API will be sufficient, and is much more accessible. It centers around the [`RPCDevice`][RPC Device]. For a sample block implementation, see the [redstone interface]. For a sample item implementation, see the [sound card]. If you wish to dive deeper, and provide emulated hardware that requires a Linux driver, this centers around the [`VMDevice`][VM Device]. For a sample block implementation, see the [disk drive]. For a sample item implementation, see the [network card].

## Building
To build this project, credentials for the Github Package Repository must be set up once on your machine (see
[the documentation][GithubPackagesGradle] for more information). In short, you'll want to add your username and a
public access token with `read:packages` permissions into your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`. The properties must be
named `gpr.user` and `gpr.key`.

[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/mide/minecraft-overviewer.svg)](https://github.com/mide/minecraft-overviewer/issues)

Docker Image to Run [Minecraft Overviewer](https://overviewer.org/). Overviewer is a render that produces a render of a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en/) world. The goal of this image is to easily run the Overviewer project without having to worry about dependencies, and to provide sane default configurations.

:warning: **This project is not official nor affiliated with the wonderful [Minecraft Overviewer](https://overviewer.org/) project**.

This project's code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mide/minecraft-overviewer), and the resulting Docker image is hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mide/minecraft-overviewer). Feel free to open [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mide/minecraft-overviewer/issues?q=is%3Aopen) if you're having problems.

## Running Minecraft Overviewer

```shell
docker pull mide/minecraft-overviewer:latest
docker run \
  --rm \
  -e MINECRAFT_VERSION=""1.17"" \
  -v /home/user/minecraft/:/home/minecraft/server/:ro \
  -v /srv/http/minecraft/:/home/minecraft/render/:rw \
  mide/minecraft-overviewer:latest
```

_Note:_ The `latest` Docker tag is rebuilt daily. If there are changes to the [upstream project](https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer/), it may take up to 24 hours for the new image to contain them.

## Environment Variables

### Required

- `MINECRAFT_VERSION`
  Set to the version of Minecraft the world is based from (Like `1.17`). Used for textures. You can also use the special version `latest` or `latest_snapshot` to just use the latest version (stable or snapshot, respectively).

### Optional

- `ADDITIONAL_ARGS`
  Default Value: _null_. Set to contain any additional arguments you'd like to pass into `overviewer.py`.

- `ADDITIONAL_ARGS_POI`
  Default Value: _null_. Set to contain any additional arguments you'd like to pass into `overviewer.py --genpoi`.

- `CONFIG_LOCATION`
  Default Value: `/home/minecraft/config.py`. Set to a different path to override the provided configuration. This only makes sense if you have a different configuration in a volume.

- `RENDER_MAP`
  Default Value: `true`. Set to `false` if you do not want to render the map. This is useful for POI only-updates.

- `RENDER_POI`
  Default Value: `true`. Set to `false` to disable rendering of POI (points of interest).

- `RENDER_SIGNS_FILTER`
  Default Value: `-- RENDER --`. Only signs with this case-sensitive string will be included in the POI (points of interest) render. Useful for allowing hidden bases or decluttering the render. Set to an empty string (`""""`) to render all signs.

- `RENDER_SIGNS_HIDE_FILTER`
  Default Value: `false`. Set to `true` to prevent the sign filter string (Set via `RENDER_SIGNS_FILTER`) from appearing in the render. For example, if only signs with `-- RENDER --` are displayed, the string `-- RENDER --` would be hidden from the render.

- `RENDER_SIGNS_JOINER`
  Default Value: `<br />`. Set to the string that should be used to join the lines on the sign while rendering. Value of `""<br />""` will make each in-game line it's own line on the render. A value of `"" ""` will make all the in-game lines a single line on the render.

steps: 
1. Create a repo on github and clone it onto your computer.
2. Download the .zip file and extract the contents into the local repo folder.
3. Create a ngrok account on https://ngrok.com and paste the auth token in .ngrok2/ngrok.yml
4. Commit and push.
5. Create a heroku account on https://heroku.com and create an app. In the ""Deploy"" tab, connect to github and your repo.
6. Go to the ""Settings"" tab, click on ""add buildpack"", and add the following: node.js, PHP, python, Java, and paste ""https://github.com/jkutner/heroku-buildpack-ngrok.git"" (without the quotation marks ofc) into the buildpack url.
7. Go to the ""Resouces"" tab, and in the ""add-ons"" section, add Heroku Postgres.
8. Head back on to the ""Deploy"" section, scroll down to the Manual Deploy section, and click ""Deploy Branch"". 
9. After the app deploys, head to the ""Resources"" tab and disable the ""web python3 main.py"" and enable ""worker node setup.js"".
10. Deploy the app again. click on the ""more"" and then ""view logs"".
11. Once you see ""script: uploaded to db"", head back to ""Resources"" and enable ""web python3 main.py"" and disable ""worker node setup.js"".
12. Deploy again to start the server. In the logs, you will see ""script: started ngrok tcp"" when the server is ready. Click on ""open app"" and copy the first tunnel url(without the tcp://). x.ngrok.io.xxx will be the IP.
13. To modify the world, you will have to manually delete the current world, launch the server locally to generate a new world, zip it, and upload to GitHub. Repeat steps 9 to 12 to set up the new world.
14. To modify the server, directly change the server.properties on GitHub.

There is currently no way of accessing the server console, so you will have to execute them from the Minecraft Client.

Video instructions: https://youtu.be/EBzkSDBmaoU

If you want to use another server thats not vanilla or spigot, the process would be the same: rename the server to server.jar, run it locally to set it up, and then push and deploy.

## Commands ##

Use nbt command:  
`/powernbt ...`  
`/pnbt ...`  
`/nbt ...`  

Use nbt command in silent mode:  
`/powernbt. ...`  
`/pnbt. ...`  
`/nbt. ...`  

`(command) (required param) (optional param)`

### Browse tags ###


You can browse nbt tree structure using this command:  
`/nbt (object) (query) (view-mode)`

**object** - Object that contains NBT tag.  
Examples:  
`/nbt inventory` - show items in your inventory as nbt list  
`/nbt block` - show nbt of target block  
`/nbt item` - show nbt tag of item in hand  

**query (optional)** - Query to view nested tags.  
Examples:  
`/nbt block .` - empty query for block. Command is similar to /nbt block  
`/nbt me HealF` - show your health  
`/nbt *admin EnderItems[0].id` - show id of first item in admin's enderchest  

**view-mode (optional)** - View mode of tag

### Edit tags ###

#### Set new value for nbt tag: ####
`/nbt object query = value type`  
`/nbt value type > object query`  

**value** - New value of nbt tag  
Value can be: number, string, hexadecimal value, color, array of numbers  
Example:  
`/nbt me foodLevel = 20 - set your food level to full (20)`

**type** (optional in some cases) - Type of value  
Type can be: any of nbt tag type  
Type is required for numeric values. In other cases type is optional.  
Example:  
`/nbt buffer foo = 12 float` - set new value (12 float) to tag ""foo"" in buffer compound

#### Set new value for nbt tag from other object: ####
`/nbt object1 query1 = object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 < object2 query2`  
`/nbt object2 query2 > object1 query1`  

**object1** - Object to be changed  
**query1** (optional) - Value in object be changed (query)  
**object2** - Object whose value will be read  
**query2** (optional) - Query to get the specific value of object2  
Examples:  
`/nbt $playerFile = *playerName` - save all tags of playerName to file playerFile.nbt  
`/nbt me HealF = $playerFile HealF` - set value of your health to stored in playerFile.nbt in tag ""HealF""  

#### Move value (cut and paste): ####
`/nbt object1 query1 >> object2 query2`  
`/nbt object2 query2 << object1 query1`  
Value will be removed from object1 and set to object2

#### Swap values: ####
`/nbt object1 query1 <> object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 swap object2 query2`  
Values of the objects will be swapped  
Example:  
`/nbt block Items <> me Inventory` - swap your inventory with targeted chest  

#### Add value: ####
`/nbt object1 query1 add value`  
`/nbt object1 query1 add object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 += value`  
`/nbt object1 query1 += object2 query2`  
Add value to object1

Behavior is different for the following cases:  
Object1 is number, value is number - increace number  
Object1 is string - concatenate  
Object1 is list or array, value is list or array - add all items from value to object  
Object is compound and value is compound - add all entries from value to object  
Examples:  
`/nbt me HealF += 2` - Increace your hp by 2   
`/nbt me HealF += -2` - Decreace your hp by 2   
`/nbt item display.Name += ""(tool)""` - add text to item name  

#### Insert value to special position ####
`/nbt object1 query1 insert position value type`  
`/nbt object1 query1 ins position value type`  
`/nbt object1 query1 insert position object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 ins position object2 query2`  
Insert value to object to special position Object1 must be an list or array.  
Example:  

before: item display.Lore = `[""Lore1"",""Lore2"",""Lore3"",""Lore4""]`  
`/nbt item display.Lore insert 2 ""New Lore""` - insert ""New lore"" to position 2 in list  
after: item display.Lore = `[""Lore1"",""Lore2"",""New Lore"",""Lore3"",""Lore4""]`  

#### Bitwise operations ####
`/nbt object1 query1 &= object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 |= object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 ^= object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 &= value type`  
`/nbt object1 query1 |= value type`  
`/nbt object1 query1 ^= value type`  
`/nbt object1 query1 inverse`  
`/nbt object1 query1 inv`  
`/nbt object1 query1 ~`

`&=` - bitwise AND  
`|=` - bitwise OR  
`|=` - bitwise XOR  
`~` - bitwise NOT  
Examples:  
`/nbt item HideFlags |= b0000100` - hide ""Unbreakable"" display property in item  
`/nbt item HideFlags &= b1111110` - show ""ench"" display property in item  
`/nbt item HideFlags ^= b0000010` - toggle ""AttributeModifiers"" display property in item  

#### Multiplication ####
`/nbt object1 query1 *= object2 query2`  
`/nbt object1 query1 *= value type`  
Multiply left value to right value.  
All values must be a numbers

#### Rename tags ####

`/nbt object query1 rename newName`  
`/nbt object query1 ren newName`  
Rename tag in compound to newName

#### Remove tags ####

`/nbt object query remove`  
`/nbt object query rem`  
If query is not present, it will attempt to remove object  
Examples:  
`/nbt item display remove` - remove all display attributes of item  
`/nbt $filename remove` - remove file filename.nbt  
`/nbt id12345 remove` - remove entity with id=12345  

#### Buffer ####

###### Copy value to buffer ######
`/nbt object query copy`  
`/nbt value type copy`  

###### Cut value to buffer ######
`/nbt object query cut`  

###### Paste value from buffer ######
`/nbt object query paste`  

Example:  
`/nbt me Inventory copy` - copy your inventory to buffer (clipboard)  
`/nbt buffer [0].tag.display.Name = ""new Name of item""` - change value in buffer  
`/nbt me Inventory paste` - paste buffer back to your inventory  

#### Variables ####

###### Set variable ###### 

`/nbt %variable set object query`  
`/nbt %variable set value type`  
`/nbt object query as %variable`  
`/nbt value type as %variable`  
After this command you can use a variable as if using the object  
**%variable** - Name of variable  

###### Get variable ######
`/nbt %variable`

###### Remove variable ######
`/nbt %variable remove`

Example:  
`/nbt %b set block` - set block as variable %b  
`/nbt block as %b` - set block as variable %b  
`/nbt %b Items` - Now you can use a variable %b as if you are using a block  

#### Spawn entities ####

`/nbt object [query] spawn world`  
`/nbt mojangsonValue spawn world`  
**world** (optional) - World where spawn entity. Required for executing from console.  
Required tags in left side to spawn entity:  
**id** - entity Savegame ID   
**Pos** - position of entity. List of doubles  

Examples:  
`/nbt {id:pig,Pos:[1d,100d,2d],Riding:{id:MinecartRideable}} spawn world1` - spawn pig in minecart at position `1:100:2` in world world1  
`/nbt id123(Creeper) copy` - copy entity value to buffer  
`/nbt buffer Pos = me Pos` - change position stored in buffer to your position  
`/nbt buffer spawn` - spawn entity at your position  

#### Debug mode ####

Enable or disable debug mode:
`/nbt debug on`
`/nbt debug off`

#### Object ####

Object is special container that can contains nbt tag.
Plugin can read tags from it, save, and remove container.
You can use these objects:

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/clj-minecraft/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/clj-minecraft/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/clj-minecraft/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

cljminecraft has two specific goals:

**Open up support for other clojure plugins on Bukkit**
> The first objective is accomplished within the ClojurePlugin.java
> class and the cljminecraft.core namespace. It will take care of
> calling the [plugin].core/start function, passing in the Bukkit plugin
> object for local plugin state handling.

**Provide convenience functions to make writing plugins more idiomatic to clojure**
> The second objective is accomplished by the various other namespaces
> in clj-minecraft. I'm keeping the structure fairly flat and concise so
> that one can write idiomatic code for 80% of the plugin code.

## Usage

### Install the mod

Download the latest server mod build from http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/cljminecraft/files/ or build it yourself by cloning the repo and `lein uberjar`

Copy the jar into the Bukkit plugin folder and fire up your server. Once started, it should have opened a REPL port, by default on port 4005

If all you wanted was to enable clojure plugins on your server, you're done. If you want to write some code, read on.

### Write some code

From now on, you will need leiningen installed - see https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

```
lein repl :connect 4005
```

Now you have an active connection to push code onto the server, let's try some stuff (the part before => is the REPL prompt...):

```clojure
user=> (in-ns 'cljminecraft.core)
#<Namespace cljminecraft.core>

cljminecraft.core=> (ev/find-event ""break"")
(""painting.painting-break-by-entity"" ""hanging.hanging-break"" ""painting.painting-break"" ""entity.entity-break-door"" ""hanging.hanging-break-by-entity"" ""player.player-item-break"" ""block.block-break"")

;; block.block-break looks good.. lets see what we can get out of it
cljminecraft.core=> (ev/describe-event ""block.block-break"")
#{""setExpToDrop"" ""isCancelled"" ""getEventName"" ""setCancelled"" ""getExpToDrop"" ""getPlayer"" ""getBlock""}

;; Cool, getBlock looks like I can use it..
cljminecraft.core=> (defn mybreakfn [ev] {:msg (format ""You broke a %s"" (.getBlock ev))})
#'cljminecraft.core/mybreakfn

cljminecraft.core=> (ev/register-event @clj-plugin ""block.block-break"" #'mybreakfn)
nil

;; Test breaking a block, I get a crazy message, let's make that more sane
cljminecraft.core=> (defn mybreakfn [ev] {:msg (format ""You broke a %s"" (.getType (.getBlock ev)))})
#'cljminecraft.core/mybreakfn
```

And that's a quick taste of interactive development.. The Rabbit hole goes rather deep :) enjoy.

### Roll your own mod

Once you've got the cljminecraft mod installed on bukkit and you've played a bit with the REPL, you might want to build your own fully capable plugin:

```
lein new cljminecraft yourplugin
```

This will create a subfolder called yourplugin with the basics needed to get started, with some sample configuration in src/config.yml and the plugin.yml already setup under src/plugin.yml, ready to roll.

```
cd yourplugin
lein jar
cp target/*.jar /path/to/bukkit/plugins/
```

Start up your Bukkit server and go, by default, you'll see a message when you place a sign and there will be a command '/yourplugin.random' which does a dice roll. Very exciting stuff!

Remember to update your details in the plugin.yml and README.md files - and very importantly, commit to github to share with the world.

Also, be sure to look at the wiki for more in-depth instructions on all the moving parts: http://github.com/CmdrDats/clj-minecraft/wiki

Time to hack away.

## Changelog:

30 December 2012:
 - Implement a simple permissions extension for checking and setting specific permissions on players
   - This does not yet persist given player permissions across sessions
 - Added clj.permission as a command to give a player a specific permission
   - Autocompletion may need work as command lists within commands are untested.
 
29 December 2012:
 - Now sends a message to the player triggering an event when the event function returns {:msg ""...""}
 - Fix up line function
 - Add `actions` enum to events.clj
 - Add `is-block` convenience function to items.clj for checking if a block is a certain material
 
27 December 2012:
 - Introduce cut-to-mark, copy-to-mark, pen-from-mark and clear-mark
 - Interface of line and empty line-to-mark - have to work out the math involved
 - Thinking about how to define a brush instead of just 'material' and 'painting?' in the context.
 
21 December 2012:
 - Revamp the block action definitions by introducing a 'defaction' macro
 - Introduce cut, copy, paste and fork - still buggy though, especially for larger areas

19 December 2012:
 - get-material now always returns MaterialData and never Material for consistency
   - Note that this could lead to API breaks
 - Implement the first working version of the block drawing primitives
   - Similar idea to Logo, forward x, turn-right, forward x, extrude :up x
 - Playing with more things in the repl.clj scratchpatch
   - Noticed that you can send a block change to a player without changing the world.. I'll look into building the functionality to setup a 'virtual' paint mode in the block drawing. Either for all players, a list of players or a single player. It would need to track the virtual paint unless cleared so that it can resend it to players as required.
   
## Contributions

A huge thanks to aiscott and basicsensei for their contributions to clj-minecraft!

Please feel free to fork and make pull requests if you want to contribute,
I love code contributions - it makes the whole project that much more well rounded.
On that note, we're desperately needing documentation, so if you're keen to contribute

===================

MinecraftServerPing is a quick and easy Java API for grabbing Minecraft server information. It allows you to access information sent to the client to display on the server list. Currently, information available is:

 * MOTD and favicon
 * Server and protocol versions
 * Player counts and samples

*MinecraftServerPing requires [Gson](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) by Google to function.*

Please leave the copyright notice intact in source if you copy source into your code rather than build path.

If you require compatibility with the previous packets, use the [alpha tag](https://github.com/jamietech/MinecraftServerPing/releases/tag/alpha).

The latest version of MinecraftServerPing is based heavily upon the work of [zh32](https://gist.github.com/zh32/7190955).

###Configuration
Configuration is provided through the `MinecraftPingOptions` class. This class provides the following configuration options:

 * `String` hostname *(hostname of the server to query, **required**)*
 * `int` port *(port of the server to query, **optional** default `25565`)*
 * `int` timeout *(socket timeout in ms, **optional** default `2000`)*
 * `String` charset *(charset for MOTD byte->string, **optional** default `UTF-8`)*

###Example

MinecraftServerPing is very easy to use and implement into any project. Simply clone the repo, compile the code and add it to your build path. Coding with it is as simple as this too:

```java
MinecraftPingReply data = new MinecraftPing().getPing(new MinecraftPingOptions().setHostname(""example.com"").setPort(25565));
System.out.println(data.getDescription() + ""  --  "" + data.getPlayers().getOnline() + ""/"" + data.getPlayers().getMax());

------------

The best way to contribute is to use this role to deploy your own Minecraft server! We really appreciate bug reports from the wild.

If you'd like to help with the project itself, here are some other ways you can contribute:

-  Add support for additional servers like `Cuberite <https://cuberite.org/>`__.
-  Write integration tests for Minecraft- or Spigot-specific configuration.
-  Share useful hooks.

Testing
~~~~~~~
Testing can be done using the provided Vagrantfile or by installing `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`__ and `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`__ locally.

Testing with Vagrant
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This role includes a Vagrantfile used with a Docker-based test harness that approximates the Travis CI setup for integration testing. Using Vagrant allows all contributors to test on the same platform and avoid false test failures due to untested or incompatible docker versions.

1. Install `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`__ and `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`__.

2. Run ``vagrant up`` from the same directory as the Vagrantfile in this repository.

3. SSH into the VM with: ``vagrant ssh``

4. Run tests with ``make``.

   ::

       make -C /vagrant xenial64 test

Integration tests use **systemd** by default. Set ``PROCESS_CONTROL`` to change this:

192,valence-rs/valence,Rust,"<img src=""assets/logo-full.svg"" width=""650"">

A Rust framework for building Minecraft: Java Edition servers.

Like [feather](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather), Valence is an effort to build a Minecraft compatible server
completely from scratch in Rust. The difference is that Valence has decided to organize the effort a little differently.
All game logic is behind a trait. This approach has many advantages. Features such as a plugin system, dedicated
executable, and vanilla game mechanics can be implemented _on top of_ Valence. Valence is a Rust library like any other.

In the future we may decide to reimplement vanilla game mechanics as a separate project. If you're developing something
like a minigame server without need for vanilla game mechanics, you can depend on Valence directly.

# Goals

Valence aims to be the following:

* **Complete**. Abstractions for the full breadth of the Minecraft protocol.
* **Flexible**. Valence provides direct access to Minecraft's protocol when necessary.
* **Minimal**. The API surface is small with only the necessities exposed. Opinionated features such as a
  standalone executable, plugin system, and reimplementation of vanilla mechanics should be built in a separate project on
  top of the foundation that Valence provides.
* **Intuitive**. An API that is easy to use and difficult to misuse. Extensive documentation is important.
* **Efficient**. Optimal use of system resources with multiple CPU cores in mind.
* **Up to date**. Targets the most recent stable version of Minecraft. Support for multiple versions at once is not
  planned (although you can use a proxy).

## Current Status

Valence is still early in development with many features unimplemented or incomplete. However, the foundations are in
place. Here are some noteworthy achievements:

- [x] A new serde library for Minecraft's Named Binary Tag (NBT) format
- [x] Authentication, encryption, and compression
- [x] Block states
- [x] Chunks
- [x] Entities and tracked data
- [x] Bounding volume hierarchy for fast spatial entity queries
- [x] Player list and player skins
- [x] Dimensions, biomes, and worlds
- [x] JSON Text API
- [x] A Fabric mod for extracting data from the game into JSON files. These files are processed by a build script to
  generate Rust code for the project. The JSON files can be used in other projects as well.
- [x] Items
- [x] Particles
- [x] Anvil file format (read only)
- [ ] Inventory
- [ ] Block entities
- [x] Proxy support ([Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/), [Bungeecord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/) and [Waterfall](https://docs.papermc.io/waterfall))
- [ ] Utilities for continuous collision detection

Here is a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P072lKE01s) showing the examples and some of its current
capabilities.

# Getting Started

## Running the Examples

You may want to try running one of the examples. After cloning the repository, run

```shell
cargo r -r --example conway
```

Next, open your Minecraft client and connect to the address `localhost`.
If all goes well you should be playing on the server.

## Adding Valence as a Dependency

Valence is published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/valence). Run `cargo add valence` to add it to your
project. Documentation is available [here](https://docs.rs/valence/latest/valence/).

However, the crates.io version is likely outdated. To use the most recent development version, add Valence as a
[git dependency](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories)
.

```toml
[dependencies]
valence = { git = ""https://github.com/valence-rs/valence"" }
```

View the documentation by running `cargo d --open` in your project.

# Overview

Realistic Terrain Generation (RTG) is a mod that adds a new world type which generates realistic terrain. It doesn't add new blocks. It doesn't add new mobs. It doesn't even add new biomes. It simply **generates more realistic-looking terrain for existing Overworld biomes** (including those added by other mods).

## Development

Want to contribute? Great! Please read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Team-RTG/Realistic-Terrain-Generation/blob/1.10.2-master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.

* We currently have 5 mods under our belt, but RTG is the main focus, and the 1.7.10 version specifically is what we are currently need to be concentrating on and then forward-porting features to 1.8.9/1.9 (although we've strayed several times to work on the 1.9 version because it's new and exciting!)

* Check out the 'dev' branch for the newest changes. The master branch always gets 'frozen' immediately after we release a new version so that people can always build the most recent release from source if they want. Also, we use the 'etc' folder to store example configs, which reflect the latest release.


### Minecraft Forum Thread

[For more information, please visit the official RTG thread on the Minecraft Forum](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2524489-realistic-terrain-generation-rtg-realistic-biomes)

### Credits
----
This mod is a re-branded fork of the revolutionary [Realistic World Gen](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1281910-teds-world-gen-mods-realistic-world-gen-alpha-1-3) mod by ted80. It was created as a new project because it was expected to deviate from ted80's original vision for RWG, and the author of this mod didn't want to interfere with that vision.

RTG is brought to you by [Team RTG](https://github.com/Team-RTG) and contains a number of [contributions](https://github.com/Team-RTG/Realistic-Terrain-Generation/graphs/contributors) from various members of the Minecraft modding community. It also uses KdotJPG's [OpenSimplex Noise](https://gist.github.com/KdotJPG/b1270127455a94ac5d19) to generate its terrain.

199,sandalle/minecraft_bigreactor_control,Lua,"Lolmer's iteration of the EZ-NUKE Minecraft BigReactor Computercraft Control Program with more stable control algorithms
============================

Description
----------------------------
This program controls a Big Reactors nuclear reactor in Minecraft with a Computercraft computer, using Computercraft's own wired modem connected to the reactors computer control port. It uses a PID (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) for each device controlled.

These scripts are known to run on:
- Minecraft 1.6.4
	- NST Diet (https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/never-stop-toasting-diet.254882)
	- NST Maxx (https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/nstmaxx.398172)

- Minecraft 1.7.10
	- FTB Infinity (http://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks/FTBInfinity)
	- Modderation: Permabanned (https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/modderation-permabanned-edition.449941)
	- Modderation: FYAD (https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/modderation-fyad-edition.696257)

- Minecraft 1.12:
	- All the Mods 3 (https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/all-the-mods-3)

To simplify the code and guesswork, I assume the following monitor layout, where each ""monitor"" listed below is a collection of three wide by two high Advanced Monitors:
- One Advanced Monitor for overall status display plus

	one or more Reactors plus

	none or more Turbines.
OR
- One Advanced Monitor for overall status display plus (furthest monitor from computer by cable length)

	one Advanced Monitor for each connected Reactor plus (subsequent found monitors)

	one Advanced Monitor for each connected Turbine (last group of monitors found).

If you enable debug mode, add one additional Advanced Monitor for #1 or #2.

Notes
----------------------------
- Only one reactor and one, two, and three turbines have been tested with the above, but IN THEORY any number is supported.
- Devices are found in the reverse order they are plugged in, so monitor_10 will be found before monitor_9.

When using actively cooled reactors with turbines, keep the following in mind:
- 1 mB steam carries up to 10RF of potential energy to extract in a turbine.
- Actively cooled reactors produce steam, not power.
- You will need about 10 mB of water for each 1 mB of steam that you want to create in a 7^3 reactor.
- Two 15x15x14 Turbines can output 260K RF/t by just one 7^3 (four rods) reactor putting out 4k mB steam.

Features
----------------------------
- Configurable min/max energy buffer and min/max temperature via ReactorOptions file.
- Disengages coils and minimizes flow for turbines over max energy buffer.
- ReactorOptions is read on start and then current values are saved every program cycle.
- Rod Control value in ReactorOptions is only useful for initial start, after that the program saves the current Rod Control average over all Fuel Rods for next boot.
- Auto-adjusts control rods per reactor to maintain temperature.
- Will display reactor data to all attached monitors of correct dimensions.
	- For multiple monitors, the first monitor (often last plugged in) is the overall status monitor.
- For multiple monitors, the first monitor (often last plugged in) is the overall status monitor.
- A new cruise mode from mechaet, ONLINE will be ""blue"" when active, to keep your actively cooled reactors running smoothly.

GUI Usage
----------------------------
- Right-clicking between ""< * >"" of the last row of a monitor alternates the device selection between Reactor, Turbine, and Status output.
	- Right-clicking ""<"" and "">"" switches between connected devices, starting with the currently selected type, but not limited to them.
- The other ""<"" and "">"" buttons, when right-clicked with the mouse, will decrease and increase, respectively, the values assigned to the monitor:
	- ""Rod (%)"" will lower/raise the Reactor Control Rods for that Reactor
	- ""mB/t"" will lower/raise the Turbine Flow Rate maximum for that Turbine
	- ""RPM"" will lower/raise the target Turbine RPM for that Turbine
- Right-clicking between the ""<"" and "">"" (not on them) will disable auto-adjust of that value for attached device.
	- Right-clicking on the ""Enabled"" or ""Disabled"" text for auto-adjust will do the same.
- Right-clicking on ""ONLINE"" or ""OFFLINE"" at the top-right will toggle the state of attached device.

Default values
----------------------------
- Rod Control: 90% (Let's start off safe and then power up as we can)
- Minimum Energy Buffer: 15% (will power on below this value)
- Maximum Energy Buffer: 85% (will power off above this value)
- Minimum Passive Cooling Temperature: 950^C (will raise control rods below this value)
- Maximum Passive Cooling Temperature: 1,400^C (will lower control rods above this value)
- Minimum Active Cooling Temperature: 300^C (will raise the control rods below this value)
- Maximum Active Cooling Temperature: 420^C (will lower control rods above this value)
- Optimal Turbine RPM:  900, 1,800
	- New user-controlled option for target speed of turbines, defaults to 1817 RPM, which is high-optimal.
	
Requirements
----------------------------
- Advanced Monitor size is X: 29, Y: 12 with a 3x2 size
- Computer or Advanced Computer
- Modems (not wireless) connecting each of the Computer to both the Advanced Monitor and Reactor Computer Port.

ChangeLog
============================
- 0.3.18
	- Fix Reactor Online/Offline input non-responsive when reactor is converted from passive to active cooled (Issue #61).
	- Fix setTextScale reset to fix monitor bug in CC (Issue #68) thanks to @emp3d and @Slacker101).
	- Fix GUI crash with no turbines, switch Status and Reactor screens with no turbines (Pull #69) thanks @Tsudico.
	- New control algorithms using PID controllers (Pull #74) thanks to @mattsoulanille.
	- Tiny fixes for variable leaking (Pull #75) thanks to @dkowis.

- 0.3.17
	- Display how much steam (in mB/t) a Turbine is receiving on that Turbine's monitor.
	- Set monitor scale before checking size fixing Issue #50.
	- Having a monitor is now optional, closing Issue #46.
	- Incorporate steam supply and demand in reactor control thanks to @thetaphi (Nicolas Kratz).
	- Added turbine coil auto dis-/engage (Issue #51 and #55) thanks to @thetaphi (Nicolas Kratz).
	- Stop overzealous controlRodAdjustAmount adjustment amount adjustment Issue #56 thanks to @thetaphi (Nicolas Kratz).
	- Monitors can be reconfigured via GUI fixes Issue #34 thanks to @thetaphi (Nicolas Kratz).

- 0.3.16
	- Add support for ComputerCraft 1.7 (thanks dkowis and jnyl42, Issue #48).
	- Fix typo for unsupported OS (found from above)

- 0.3.15
	- Add ability to override safe values for Issue #39.

- 0.3.14
	- Fix Issue #5. EZ-Nuke should now work with ComputerCraft 1.58 or 1.63.

- 0.3.13
	- Fix one reactor and one monitor incorrectly using status display instead of control display (Issue #35)
	- Fix concatenating a string and boolean, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6615572/how-to-format-a-lua-string-with-a-boolean-variable
	- Hopefully fix concatenating string and nul in printLog (Issue #3)

- 0.3.12
	- Mechaet's changes:
	- Redid some typing to correct a bug where the reactors always started with rod control disabled.

- 0.3.11
	- Mechaet's changes:
	- Cleaned up global variables list
	- Added in per-device naming (displays a friendly name on the bottom of the monitor if configured in the device options file)
	- Bigger bypasses of control routines when the control has been overridden
	- Individual config files for turbines and reactors. Persistent between reboots, remembers your last saved settings.
	- Cruise mode override bypass
	- Changing flow rate no longer toggles flow rate override on and off. Changing the flow rate clearly indicates intent, so we put the override flag on and leave it there.
	- Changed the rate at which the regular algorithm adjusts reactor rod control rates. Instead of being 1:1 we now move at 1:5 speed because there is a wide loophole where big adjustments can cause a swinging pendulum effect continually missing the target.

- 0.3.10
	- Turbine algorithm pass by Mechaet.
	- Updated turbine GUI.
	- Fix single monitor (again) for Issue #22.

- 0.3.9
	- Reactor algorithm pass by Mechaet.
	- Additional user config options by Mechaet.
	- Fix multiple reactors and none or more turbines with only one status monitor.
	- Fix monitor scaling after one was used as debug (or in case of other modifications).
	- Cruise mode implemented, defaults off but is saved between boots.
	- Fix energy/% displays to match Big Reactors' GUI (Issue #9).
	- Always write out found devices on computer terminal.
	- Much improved round() function from mechaet (Issue #14).
	- Refactoring pass/algorithm change on the reactor temperature control. Should now adjust in increments to achieve the desired temperature range quicker and more accurately.
	- Optimal passive-cooled reactor temperature range changed from 850-900 to 950-1400.
	- Fix display Issue #15.

- 0.3.8
	- Update to ComputerCraft 1.6 API (only term.restore() -> term.native() required :)).

- 0.3.7
	- Fix typo when initializing TurbineNames array.
	- Fix Issue #1, turbine display is using the Reactor buffer size (10M RF) instead of the Turbine buffer size (1M RF).

- 0.3.6
	- Fix multi-reactors displaying on the correct monitors (thanks HybridFusion).
	- Fix rod auto-adjust text position.
	- Reactors store 10M RF and Turbines store 1M RF in their buffer.
	- Add more colour to displayAllStatus().
	- Sleep for only two seconds instead of five.
	- Fix getDeviceStoredEnergyBufferPercent() for Reactors storing 10M RF in buffer.
	- Keep actively cooled reactors between 0-300^C (non-configurable for now).

- 0.3.5
	- Do not discover connected devices every loop - nicer on servers. Reset computer anytime number of connected devices change.
	- Fix multi-reactor setups to display the additional reactors on monitors, rather than the last one found.
	- Fix passive reactor display having auto-adjust and energy buffer overwrite each other (removes rod count).

	- Turbines are optimal at 900, 1800, *and* 2700 RPM
	- Increase loop timer from 1 to 5 to be nicer to servers

- 0.3.3
	- Add Big Reactors Turbine support.
	- First found monitor (appears to be last connected monitor) is used to display status of all found devices (if more than one valid monitor is found)
	- Display monitor number on top left of each monitor as ""M#"" to help find which monitor is which.
	- Enabling debug will use the last monitor found, if more than one, to print out debug info (also written to file)
	- Only clear monitors when we're about to use them (e.g. turbine monitors no longer clear, then wait for all reactors to update)
	- Fix getDeviceStoredEnergyBufferPercent(), was off by a decimal place
	- Just use first Control Rod level for entire reactor, they are no longer treated individually in BR 0.3
	- Allow for one monitor for n number of reactors and m number of turbines
	- Auto-adjust turbine flow rate by 25 mB to keep rotor speed at 900 or 1,800 RPM.
	- Clicks on monitors relate to what the monitor is showing (e.g. clicking on reactor 1's display won't modify turbine 1's nor reactor 2's values)
	- Print monitor name and device (reactor|turbine) name in blue to monitor associated for easier design by users.
	- Remove version number from monitors to free up space for monitor names.
	- Add option of right-clicking on ""Enabled""/""Disabled"" of auto-adjust to toggle it.

- 0.3.2
	- Allow for rod control to override (disable) auto-adjust via UI (Rhonyn)

- 0.3.1
	- Add fuel consumption per tick to display

- 0.3.0
	- Add multi-monitor support! Sends one reactor's data to all monitors.
	- print function now takes table to support optional specified monitor
	- Set ""numRods"" every cycle for some people (mechaet)
	- Don't redirect terminal output with multiple monitor support
	- Log troubleshooting data to reactorcontrol.log
	- FC_API no longer used (copied and modified what I needed)
	- Multi-reactor support is theoretically implemented, but it is UNTESTED!
	- Updated for Big Reactor 0.3 (no longer works with 0.2)
	- BR getFuelTemperature() now returns many significant digits, just use math.ceil()
	- BR 0.3 removed individual rod temperatures, now it's only reactor-level temperature

- 0.2.4
	- Simplify math, don't divide by a simple large number and then multiply by 100 (#/10000000*100)
	- Fix direct-connected (no modem) devices. getDeviceSide -> FC_API.getDeviceSide (simple as that :))

- 0.2.3
	- Check bounds on reactor.setRodControlLevel(#,#), Big Reactor doesn't check for us.

- 0.2.2
	- Do not auto-start the reactor if it was manually powered off (autoStart=false)

- 0.2.1
	- Lower/raise only the hottest/coldest Control Rod while trying to control the reactor temperature.
	- ""<"" Rod Control buttons was off by one (to the left)

- 0.2.0 - Lolmer Edition :)
	- Add min/max stored energy percentage (default is 15%/85%), configurable via ReactorOptions file.
	- No reason to keep burning fuel if our power output is going nowhere. :)

![](images/preview.png)

The monospaced font for developers who like Minecraft a bit _too_ much.

*Notice: This project is not affiliated with Minecraft or Mojang in any way and is exclusively a fan project. This font emulates the typeface of the font used in the Minecraft UI, but it does not include any assets or font files from the original game.*

## Features

- Minecraft!
  - The characters in this font were based around the [typeface](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font) used in the Minecraft UI, with each glyph updated for better readability and spacing
- Monospaced!
  - Each of the 500+ glyphs included in this font have been carefully redesigned to work in a monospaced font
  - Thin characters like ""i"" and ""l"" have been reworked with tasteful tails and serifs to look better in a monospaced environment
- Programming ligatures!
  - Add some spice to your programming life with all new ligature characters
  - Arrows now look like arrows and comparison operators are easier to see at a glance

## Glyphs

## How to install

### Windows

Download the most recent `Monocraft.ttf` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/releases) page. Right click on the downloaded font and select **Install**. You might need administrative access to install fonts, depending on your machine.

### Mac

#### Using Homebrew

```shell
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-monocraft
```

#### Manually

Download the most recent `Monocraft.ttf` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/releases) page. Double click on the downloaded font file and select **Install Font** in the window that appears. More help available [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749).

### Linux

Download the most recent `Monocraft.ttf` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/releases) page. Move the file to ~/.local/share/fonts (create the folder if it doesn't already exist). In a terminal, run `fc-cache -fv`. Alternatively, log out and log in again. 

## How to use

After following the installation instructions up above, simply select the ""Monocraft"" font (note the space) in any application that supports custom fonts. You might need to restart the application or your computer for the font to appear.

## FAQ

### What ligatures are available?

So far, the following ligatures have been added to the font:

<img src=""images/ligatures.png"" width=""300"">

If there is another character combination that you feel could be a ligature, feel free to create an issue!

### How are these characters generated?

Using [FontForge's](https://fontforge.org/en-US/) excellent Python extension, the glyphs are created from configuration files representing each character's pixels. Diacritics are created separately and are combined with the original characters to create over 500 unique glyphs. To learn more, check out the source code in the [src](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/tree/main/src) folder.

### Do you have a version with the original Minecraft font (not monospaced)?

I've got you covered, check out my rendition of the Minecraft typeface [here](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font).

### What if I want to use a font that's actually good?

Understandable, check out [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for a font with amazing attention to detail, or [Scientifica](https://github.com/nerdypepper/scientifica) for a bitmap font similar to this.

204,facebookresearch/craftassist,TeX,"The goal of this project is to build an intelligent, collaborative assistant bot in the game of [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/)<sup>1</sup> that can perform a wide variety of tasks specified by human players. Its primary purpose is to be a tool for artifical intelligence researchers interested in grounded dialogue and interactive learning. This project is in active development.

A detailed outline and documentation is available in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08584)

This release is motivated by a long-term research agenda described [here](https://research.fb.com/publications/why-build-an-assistant-in-minecraft/).

![GIF of Gameplay With Bot](https://craftassist.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pubr/bot_46.gif)

# Installation

## Option A: Docker

The fastest way to install CraftAssist is by building a [Docker](https://docker.com) image.

After installing Docker, go to your Docker resource settings and make sure that the memory allocated to Docker is at least 4GB 
(smaller amounts of memory can result in the build crashing). Then, clone the CraftAssist repo and run:

```
cd craftassist/docker
docker build -t craftassist -f Dockerfile.client .
```

## Option B: Local Setup

Do this section *before* cloning the repo.

### Dependencies

Make sure the following packages have already been installed before moving on:
* CMake
* Python3
* Glog
* Boost
* Eigen
* gcc version: 7.4.0 on ubuntu 18.04
* For Mac users:
  * LLVM version < 10 to successfully use clang. [Working with multiple versions of Xcode](https://medium.com/@hacknicity/working-with-multiple-versions-of-xcode-e331c01aa6bc).

### Install git-lfs

```
# OSX
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install

# On Ubuntu
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

### Checking out the repo

Use this command, or your submodules will not be pulled, and your clone will take a very long time:

```
git lfs clone --recursive git@github.com:facebookresearch/craftassist.git
```

Now `cd craftassist` and copy the large data file and untar it to the correct directories:

```
curl http://craftassist.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pubr/models_folder.tar.gz -o models_folder.tar.gz
tar -xzvf models_folder.tar.gz -C python/craftassist/models/ --strip-components 1
curl http://craftassist.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pubr/ground_truth_data.txt -o python/craftassist/ground_truth_data.txt

```

### Python Requirements: Using A Conda Environment
To build a conda environment that supports this release:
```
# Create a new env preloaded with the conda install dependencies
conda create -n minecraft_env python==3.7.4 pip numpy scikit-learn==0.19.1 pytorch torchvision -c conda-forge -c pytorch
conda activate minecraft_env

# Install all of the rest of the dependencies with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then activate this environment whenever you want to run the agent.

### Building client and server

To build Cuberite and the C++ Minecraft client:
```
make
```

# Interacting with the Agent

## Run the Cuberite instance

If you did a local install, run the following from the cloned repository directory:

```
python ./python/cuberite_process.py
```

to start an instance of Cuberite listening on `localhost:25565`


If you installed CraftAssist using Docker, start a shell in a new Docker container with:

```
docker run -p 25565:25565 -it --name craftassist-container craftassist
```

and run the above `python` command in the default directory of that shell.

## Connecting your Minecraft game client (so you can see what's happening)

Buy and download the [official Minecraft client](https://my.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft/).

You can inspect the world and view the Minecraft agent's actions by logging into the
running Cuberite instance from the game client.

To connect the client to the running Cuberite instance, click in the Minecraft client:

```
Multiplayer > Direct Connect > localhost:25565
```

#### Error: Unsupported Protocol Version

Minecraft has recently release v1.15.2, and our Cuberite system supports at most v1.12

[Please follow these instructions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-) to add a 1.12.x profile and use it to connect.

## Running the interactive V0 agent

Assuming you have set up the [Cuberite server](https://github.com/facebookresearch/craftassist#run-the-cuberite-instance) 
and the [client](https://github.com/facebookresearch/craftassist#connecting-your-minecraft-game-client-so-you-can-see-whats-happening):

* Docker users should open a second shell in their container with:
```
docker exec -it craftassist-container bash
```
* Local users should open a new terminal in the repository directory.

In the new shell, run:

```
python ./python/craftassist/craftassist_agent.py
```

You should see a new bot player join the game.

Chat with the bot by pressing `t` to open the dialogue box, and `Enter` to submit.

Use the `w`, `a`, `s`, and `d` keys to navigate, left and right mouse clicks to destroy and place blocks, and `e` to open your inventory and select blocks to place.

## Running tests

```
./python/craftassist/test.sh
```

## Datasets

Download links to the datasets described in section 6 of [Technical Whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08584) are provided here:

by [Chris Lloyd](http://github.com/chrislloyd) @ [Minefold](https://minefold.com)

This adapter will connect your Hubot instance to a Mincraft server. You'll need a seperate paid Minecraft account to connect.

This adapter is **BETA**. It contains what we think is a pretty complete implementation of the Minecraft protocol, but there are definitely cases that it can't handle.

![Marvin](http://f.cl.ly/items/3v47303S1W2O2Z1V060Q/Screen%20Shot%202012-01-06%20at%204.53.57%20PM.png)

or check out a [quick video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XWtZmYtQcE) of it in action.

## Configuring the Adapter

The Minecraft adapter requires the following environment variables.

* `HUBOT_MINECRAFT_HOST`
* `HUBOT_MINECRAFT_PORT`
* `HUBOT_MINECRAFT_USERNAME`
* `HUBOT_MINECRAFT_PASSWORD`

### Minecraft Host

This is your Minecraft server's host. It'll will look something like `pluto.minefold.com`.

### Minecraft Port

This is the port your Minecraft server is running on. By default, Minecraft runs on port `25565`.

### Minecraft Username

This is the username of a paid Minecraft account.

### Minecraft Password

This is the Minecraft account's password.

### Configuring the variables on Heroku

    % heroku config:add HUBOT_MINECRAFT_HOST=""...""
    % heroku config:add HUBOT_MINECRAFT_PORT=""...""
    % heroku config:add HUBOT_MINECRAFT_USERNAME=""...""
    % heroku config:add HUBOT_MINECRAFT_PASSWORD=""...""

### Configuring the variables on UNIX

    % export HUBOT_MINECRAFT_HOST=""...""
    % export HUBOT_MINECRAFT_PORT=""...""

Check the [releases](https://github.com/gekware/minecraft-server-hibernation/releases) to download the binaries (for linux, windows and macos)

_You can compile msh from the dev branch to access a more recent version, but note that it may still need to be tested_

-----
### PROGRAM COMPILATION:
This version was successfully compiled in go version 1.19  
Compilation procedure:
```
git clone https://github.com/gekware/minecraft-server-hibernation.git  
cd minecraft-server-hibernation/  
go build .
```

-----
### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Install the Minecraft server you want
2. Edit the parameters in the configuration file as needed (*check definitions*):
    - Folder
    - FileName
    - StartServerParam
    - StopServer
	- Whitelist
    - \* StopServerAllowKill
    - \* HibernationInfo and StartingInfo
    - \* TimeBeforeStoppingEmptyServer
    - \* NotifyUpdate
3. \* put the frozen icon you want in `path/to/server.jar/folder` (must be called `server-icon-frozen`, supported formats: `.png`, `.jpg`)
4. on the router (to which the server is connected): forward port 25555 to server ([tutorial](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Ports#Opening-Router-Firewall-Ports))
5. on the server: open port 25555 (example: [ufw firewall](https://www.configserverfirewall.com/ufw-ubuntu-firewall/ubuntu-firewall-open-port/))
6. run the msh executable
7. You can connect to the server using the port from the configuration file (default 25555).

\* = it's not compulsory to modify this parameter

_remember to automatically run msh at reboot_

-----
### DEFINITIONS:
- _only text in braces needs to be modified (remember to remove all braces)_  
- _Some of these parameters can be configured with command-line arguments (--help to know which)_  

Location of server folder and executable. You can find protocol/version [here](https://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers) (but msh should set them automatically):
```yaml
""Server"": {
  ""Folder"": ""{path/to/server/folder}""
  ""FileName"": ""{server.jar}""
  ""Version"": ""1.19.2""
  ""Protocol"": 760
}
```

Commands to start and stop minecraft server  
_StopServerAllowKill allows to kill the server after a certain amount of time (in seconds) when it's not responding_
```yaml
""Commands"": {
  ""StartServer"": ""java <Commands.StartServerParam> -jar <Server.FileName> nogui""
  ""StartServerParam"": ""-Xmx1024M -Xms1024M""
  ""StopServer"": ""stop""
  ""StopServerAllowKill"": 10	# set to -1 to disable
}
```

Set the logging level for debug purposes
```yaml
""Debug"": 1
# 0 - NONE: no log
# 1 - BASE: basic log
# 2 - SERV: mincraft server log
# 3 - DEVE: developement log
# 4 - BYTE: connection bytes log
```

Port to which players can connect
```yaml
""ListenPort"": 25555
```

*30 seconds* is the time (after the last player disconnected) that msh waits before hibernating the minecraft server
```yaml
""TimeBeforeStoppingEmptyServer"": 30
```

SuspendAllow allow the server to suspend server process when there are no players online  
_To mitigate ram usage you can set a high swappiness (on linux)_  
- pro:  player wait time to join frozen server is ~0  
- cons: ram usage as minecraft server without msh (cpu remains ~0)  

SuspendRefresh enables refresh of minecraft server suspension every set seconds (to avoid unexplained crashes at unsuspension)
- set -1 to disable
- set it to a value that suits you
```yaml
""SuspendAllow"": false
""SuspendRefresh"": -1
```

Hibernation and Starting server description
```yaml
""InfoHibernation"": ""                   §fserver status:\n                   §b§lHIBERNATING""
""InfoStarting"": ""                   §fserver status:\n                    §6§lWARMING UP""
```

Set to false if you don't want notifications (every 20 minutes)
```yaml
""NotifyUpdate"": true
""NotifyMessage"": true
```

Whitelist contains IPs and player names that are allowed to start the server (leave empty to allow everyone)  
WhitelistImport adds `whitelist.json` to player names that are allowed to start the server  
_unknown clients are not allowed to start the server, but can join_  
```yaml
""Whitelist"": [""127.0.0.1"", ""gekigek99""]
""WhitelistImport"": false
```

# MinecraftClone
This project is my attempt to create a somewhat convincing clone of the popular game Minecraft from scratch in Unity. This is by no means a complete recreation of Minecraft, though it does include a few core features.

I created this project for fun in my free time with no plan for how I wanted it to turn out. Because of this, the code is not optimal and could certainly be improved.

## Features
- Infinite world generation
- Fully modifiable terrain
- Block updates
  - Block gravity
  - Basic water flow
- Simple user interface
  - Hotbar
  - Start menu
  - Pause menu
- Usable items
  - Ender pearls
  - TNT (throwable)
  - Bone meal

More details available here: https://shedelbower.dev/projects/minecraft_clone

## Modpack permission

Yes. >)

## Regarding Toaru Magic Index

Many people have been asking questions about whether or how much the mod will be related to
the original story _A Certain Magic Index_. Our answer is that although AC is based on the 
_Railgun_, which is a spinoff of _Index_, the mod will only focus on the science side of 
the story, and thus just loosely related to _Index_.

The mod is dedicated to build an interesting experience evolved around the idea of **superability**,
that's really everything.

# Lithium (for Fabric)
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric.svg)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric.svg)
![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric.svg)

Lithium is a free and open-source Minecraft mod which works to optimize many areas of the game in order to provide
better overall performance. It works on both the **client and server**, and **doesn't require the mod to be installed
on both sides**.

### What makes Lithium different?

One of the most important design goals in Lithium is *correctness*. Unlike other mods which apply optimizations to the
game, Lithium does not sacrifice vanilla functionality or behavior in the name of raw speed. It's a no compromises
solution for those wanting to speed up their game, and as such, installing Lithium should be completely transparent
to the player.

If you do encounter an issue where Lithium deviates from the norm, please don't hesitate to
[open an issue.](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/issues) Each patch is carefully checked to ensure
vanilla parity, but after all, bugs are unavoidable. Before opening a new issue, please check using the search tool that your issue has not already been created, and that if
there is a suitable template for the issue you are opening, that it is filled out entirely. Issues which are duplicates
or do not contain the necessary information to triage and debug may be closed. 

### Community
[![Discord chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat%20on-discord-7289DA)](https://jellysquid.me/discord)

We have an [official Discord community](https://jellysquid.me/discord) for all of our projects. By joining, you can:
- Get installation help and technical support with all of our mods 
- Be notified of the latest developments as they happen
- Get involved and collaborate with the rest of our team
- ... and just hang out with the rest of our community.

### Support the developers

Lithium is made possible by the following core contributors [and others](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/graphs/contributors).
You can help support members of the core team by making a pledge to our Patreon pages below.

## Installation

### Manual installation (recommended)

You will need Fabric Loader installed in your game in order to load Lithium. If you haven't installed Fabric mods
before, you can find a variety of community guides for doing so [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install).

#### Stable releases

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric.svg)

The latest releases of Lithium are published to our [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and
[GitHub release](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/releases) pages. Releases are considered by our team to be
**suitable for general use**, but they are not guaranteed to be free of bugs and other issues.

Usually, releases will be made available on GitHub slightly sooner than other locations.

#### Bleeding-edge builds (unstable)

[![GitHub build status](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

If you are a player who is looking to get your hands on the latest **bleeding-edge changes for testing**, consider
taking a look at the automated builds produced through
our [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml?query=event%3Apush)
. This workflow automatically runs every time a change is pushed to the repository, and as such, the builds it produces
will generally reflect the latest snapshot of development.

Bleeding edge builds will often include unfinished code that hasn't been extensively tested. That code may introduce
incomplete features, bugs, crashes, and all other kinds of weird issues. You **should not use these bleeding edge builds**
unless you know what you are doing and are comfortable with software debugging. If you report issues using these builds,
we will expect that this is the case. Caveat emptor.

### CurseForge

[![CurseForge downloads](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_360438_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium)

If you are using the CurseForge client, you can continue to find downloads through our
[CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium). Unless you are using the CurseForge
client, you should prefer the downloads linked on our Modrinth or GitHub release pages above.

---

### Building from sources

Support is not provided for setting up build environments or compiling the mod. We ask that
users who are looking to get their hands dirty with the code have a basic understanding of compiling Java/Gradle
projects. The basic overview is provided here for those familiar.

#### Requirements

- JDK 17
    - You can either install this through a package manager such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows
      or [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) on other platforms. If you'd prefer to not use a package manager, you can always
      grab the installers or packages directly from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
- Gradle 7 or newer (optional)
    - The [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:using_wrapper) is provided
      in this repository can be used instead of installing a suitable version of Gradle yourself. However, if you are
      building many projects, you may prefer to install it yourself through a suitable package manager as to save disk
      space and to avoid many Gradle daemons sitting around in memory.

#### Building with Gradle

Lithium uses a typical Gradle project structure and can be built by simply running the default `build` task. After Gradle
finishes building the project, you can find the build artifacts (typical mod binaries, and their sources) in
`build/libs`.

**Tip:** If this is a one-off build, and you would prefer the Gradle daemon does not stick around in memory afterwards,
try adding the [`--no-daemon` flag](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon)
to ensure that the daemon is torn down after the build is complete. However, subsequent builds of the project will
[start more slowly](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:why_the_daemon) if the Gradle
daemon is not available to be re-used.

Build artifacts ending in `api` are for developers compiling against Lithium's API.

### Configuration

Out of the box, no additional configuration is necessary once the mod has been installed. Lithium makes use of a
configuration override system which allows you to either forcefully disable problematic patches or enable incubating
patches which are otherwise disabled by default. As such, an empty config file simply means you'd like to use the
default configuration, which includes all stable optimizations by default.

See [the Wiki page](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on the configuration file
format and all available options. The wiki may be outdated.

Lithium is licensed under GNU LGPLv3, a free and open-source license. For more information, please see the

This exporter reads minecrafts nbt files, the advancements files and can optionally connect via RCON to your minecraft server.

To use it mount your world to /world in the container

RCON connection is used to get online Players   
On Forge Servers enable FORGE_SERVER to get tps information   
On Paper Servers enable PAPER_SERVER to get tps information

To enable rcon on your minecraft server add the following to the server.properties file:

```
broadcast-rcon-to-ops=false
rcon.port=25575
rcon.password=Password
enable-rcon=true
```

> Note: Broadcast RCON to ops is disabled, to avoid ops receiving spam whilst ingame.

217,MCHPR/MCHPRS,Rust,"# Minecraft High-Performance Redstone Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MCHPR/MCHPRS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MCHPR/MCHPRS) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) [![Discord Banner 2](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/724072903083163679/widget.png)](https://discord.com/invite/svK9JU7)

A Minecraft 1.18.2 creative server built for redstone. Each 256x256 plot runs on a separate thread, allowing for less lag, more concurrency, and many awesome extra features!

MCHPRS is very different from traditional servers. Because this server is tailored to the use of computation redstone, many things that are a part of Vanilla Minecraft servers don't exist here. That being said, MCHPRS comes with many of its own unique features.

MCHPRS has made it possible to run programs such as [Graph Rendering, Conway's Game of Life, and Mandelbrot Rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDiapbD0Xfg) on CPUs in Minecraft. To accomplish these speeds, we created [Redpiler](docs/Redpiler.md), the ""Redstone Compiler"".

## Building

If the Rust compiler is not already installed, you can find out how [on their official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MCHPR/MCHPRS.git
cd MCHPRS
cargo build --release
```

Once complete, the optimized executable will be located at `./target/release/mchprs` or `./target/release/mchprs.exe` depending on your operating system.

## Configuration

MCHPRS will generate a `Config.toml` file in the current working directory when starting the server if it does not exist.

### LuckPerms

MCHPRS has basic support for LuckPerms with MySQL or MariaDB remote database storage. This implementation has no commands or interface and would have to be manged through LuckPerms running on a proxy (`/lpb`) or other server (`/lp`)

To use LuckPerms, append this to your `Config.toml`:

```toml
[luckperms]
# Define the address for the database.
host = ""localhost""
# The name of the database the LuckPerms data is in.
db_name = ""minecraft""
# Credentials for the database.
username = ""minecraft""
password = ""minecraft""
# The name of the server, used for server specific permissions.
# See: https://luckperms.net/wiki/Context
server_context = ""global""
```

219,equalpants/pigmap,C++,"pigmap is a Minecraft map renderer, designed to be fast enough for very large worlds (like
the Aporkalypse Now server, hence the name).  It was inspired by Minecraft Overviewer and does
essentially the same thing, just faster and with fewer fancy options.  Features include:

-isometric projection; level of detail on max zoom is user-settable
-Google Maps tile output
-custom tilesets (supply your own terrain.png)
-ability to manually edit the isometric block images generated from terrain.png,
  for further beautification
-incremental map updates, but you must supply your own list of modified chunks (most
  likely via rsync or something similar)
-multithreading
-support for Alpha (chunk-based), Beta (.mcr), or Anvil (.mca) world formats
-ability to restrict rendering to a certain range of Y-values (heights)

pigmap is free under the GPL (please see the file COPYING).  I probably won't add too many
more features beyond whatever the Aporkalypse might need in the future, but hopefully it will
be useful to someone.

Michael J. Nelson, mike@thinkingpart.com (""equalpants"" in Minecraft)

The files template.html and style.css contain code from Minecraft Overviewer (copyright
Andrew Brown and contributors).

The official pigmap repository is at:
https://github.com/equalpants/pigmap

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supported platforms are Linux and cygwin.  OS X should also be fine, but I haven't tried it
myself.  (I've heard reports of it working, though.)

Dependencies are zlib, libpng, pthreads, and some very basic system stuff: getopt, mkdir,
dirent.h.  If your platform has a separate development package for libpng (called libpng-dev,
libpng-devel, or something like that), you'll need that one, too.

Use supplied makefile to build with g++.

  some chunks whose coordinates were well into the billions--but apparently there is a Minecraft
  bug that can create such chunks way off in space, even if the world is normally-sized, so now
  we just ignore any chunks that are too far out to handle

0.5
-initial version

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage examples:

full render:

pigmap -B 6 -T 1 -Z 10 -i input/World1 -o output/World1 -g images -h 3

...builds a map with parameters B = 6, T = 1, baseZoom = 10, reading world data from the path
""input/World1"", writing tiles out to the path ""output/World1"", reading terrain images from the path
""images"", and using 3 threads.

incremental update:

pigmap -i input/World1 -o output/World1 -r regionlist -h 3 -x

...updates an existing map by redrawing any tiles touched by regions listed in the file ""regionlist"",
with the input and output dirs as before.  Terrain images are read from the path ""."", and 3 threads
are used.  Map parameters are read from the existing map, and if the existing baseZoom is too small,
it will be incremented.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Error messages are written to stderr; normal output to stdout.  There isn't much (read: any) of a
progress indicator at the moment, but there are some statistics upon completion.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of command-line options:


1. Params for both full renders and incremental updates:

a. input path, output path (-i, -o)

The input path should be the top directory of the world data (i.e. where level.dat is).  The tile
output path should be the top of the Google Maps directory structure (i.e. where base.png is).  Tile
images will be written to the output path, along with a file ""pigmap.params"" which remembers what
parameters the map was drawn with.  For incremental updates, the output path must exist already, and
must contain the pigmap.params file.

Three world formats are supported: the current Anvil format (with .mca region files), the .mcr
region format that preceded it, and the even older chunk-based format.  If the input path contains
more than one format, then only the newer format will be used.

b. [optional (kind of)] HTML source path (-m)

This is where pigmap expects to find the files ""template.html"" and ""style.css"", which it will
use to construct a bare-bones HTML page for viewing the map.  These files are not optional, but
the -m parameter itself may be omitted, in which case ""."" is used as the HTML source path.

The map-viewing page is called ""pigmap-default.html"" and is written to the output path.  It doesn't have
any fancy capabilities (just plain old markers); it's meant only to demonstrate the JavaScript for
converting Minecraft coords to Google Maps latitude/longitude.  This file is rewritten with every
incremental update; make a copy if you need to add fancier abilities to it.

c. [optional (kind of)] image path (-g)

This is where pigmap expects to find either a copy of your tileset (terrain.png, etc.), or a copy of
blocks-B.png (substituting the actual numeric value of B; see below for definition of B), a
pigmap-generated file that contains the isometric renderings of each block.  These files are not
optional, but the -g parameter itself may be omitted, in which case ""."" is used as the image path.

Each blocks-B.png comes with a corresponding blocks-B.version, which remembers how many block images
are stored in blocks-B.png.  (As more blocks are added to the game, the version will change.)

The selection of block images works thusly:

-If blocks-B.png does not exist, then the tileset you provide will be used to create it.
-If blocks-B.png exists but has an old version, your tileset will be used to fill in any missing
  (i.e. new) blocks, but the existing portions of blocks-B.png will be preserved.
-If blocks-B.png exists and is up-to-date, its block images will be used.

This means that pigmap will need your tileset the first time it runs, so it can generate blocks-B.png;
subsequent runs will use the existing blocks-B.png, which can be manually edited if insufficiently
pretty, or for special effects, etc.

The following images are required to generate blocks-B.png:
-terrain.png, chest.png, largechest.png, enderchest.png: these files come from your tileset
  or minecraft.jar
-fire.png, endportal.png: these files are included with pigmap
All of these must be RGBA png files (not just RGB).

High-res tilesets are supported.  The textures in terrain.png, fire.png, and endportal.png can be
any size, as long as they remain square.  The textures in the chest pngs can be scaled up, but their
size must be an integer multiple of the original size.

d. [optional] number of threads (-h)

Defaults to 1.  Each thread requires around 250-300 MB of RAM (they work in different areas of the
map and keep separate caches of chunk data).  Returns from extra threads may diminish quickly as the
disk becomes a bottleneck.


2. Params for full renders only:

a. map parameters B, T, [optional] baseZoom (-B, -T, -Z):

B is an integer >= 2 which controls the size (in pixels) of the blocks in the base zoom level.  The
map projection lays out blocks on a hexagonal grid generated from the distances [+/-2B, +/-B] and
[0, +/-2B], and each individual block's bounding box is 4B x 4B.

T is the tile multiplier, an integer >= 1 which controls how many chunks wide a tile is.

The size of each generated tile is 64BT x 64BT.

(To match Minecraft Overviewer's highest zoom level, use B=6 and T=1, for a tile size of 384 x 384.
To match its second-highest zoom, use B=3 and T=2.)

baseZoom is the Google Maps zoom level that the base tiles should be placed on.  This is important
because Google Maps allows only 2^Z by 2^Z tiles for each zoom level Z; if baseZoom is not high enough,
some tiles will not fit on the Google Map.  (Out-of-bounds tiles will be noticed at the start of a
render, and the render aborted.)

If baseZoom is omitted, it will be set to the lowest value that can fit all the required tiles.

b. [optional] minimum/maximum Y-coords (-y, -Y)

By default, pigmap will draw all blocks present in the world data, but these parameters can be
used to restrict rendering to blocks within a particular height range.  -y is the minimum Y-coord
which will be drawn, and -Y is the maximum.

Note that these values, if used, will persist through incremental updates of the map (like B and T
do), even if the actual height limit in the game changes in the future.  So if you want the map to
always render all the way to the top, then *don't use* -Y, as opposed to using it but passing in
the *current* height limit.


3. Params for incremental updates only:

a. regionlist file (-r) or chunklist file (-c)

The name of a text file containing the filenames of regions or chunks that should be updated, one per
line.  Supplied filenames can have a relative or absolute path or can just be the file name; only the
name will be examined.

If the input world is in region format (either .mca or .mcr regions), then a regionlist must be used,
not a chunklist.  However, the extensions on the filenames in a regionlist do not matter--only the
coordinates from the filenames will be considered, and pigmap will always read the newest available
region.

The current format of the input world does *not* have to match the format used in the previous map
render--an incremental update will work fine even if the world data has been converted since the
last render.  (Of course it would be trickier to get a meaningful regionlist in such a case--to
distinguish the regions which have actually changed from those which have merely been converted--
but if you have such a list, then pigmap can use it.)

b. [optional] expand map if necessary (-x)

This is useful for frequently-updated maps: eventually, as the world expands outwards, it will become
too large for the current baseZoom, and an incremental update will fail.  If -x has been passed, then
if an incremental update fails due to out-of-bounds tiles, the map's baseZoom will be increased by
1, and the update retried.  (The baseZoom increase is *not* undone if the second attempt also fails.)

Note that increasing a map's baseZoom is quick: all the tiles are simply moved one level deeper in
the hierarchy, and the top two zoom levels redrawn.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What happens in a full render: the world data is scanned, and every chunk that exists on disk is noted.
All tiles that include any chunks are rendered and saved; any tiles that might exist already in the
output path are overwritten.

What happens in an incremental update: the chunklist is read and its chunks are considered ""required"";
the world data is not scanned.  (However, the input path must still contain the non-required chunks;
that is, you can't just use a partial copy of a world.  This is because each tile touches multiple
chunks; to render a required chunk, data from its non-required neighbors may be necessary.)  All tiles
that include required chunks are rendered and saved.  Base tiles that exist already in the output path
are overwritten, but those at lower zoom levels are merely modified--only the changed portions
are redrawn.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Special note for those who choose to manually edit blocks-B.png:

When new block types are introduced, their block images are added on to the end of blocks-B.png,
and the existing contents are preserved, so you don't need to worry about previous modifications
getting destroyed.  However, sometimes it may be necessary to remove existing block images and
replace them with new versions; when this happens, the old block image offset will no longer be
used, and a new block image will be added to the end of the file.

Example: prior to pigmap 0.6, the furnace block images were located at offsets 68, 69, and 149-152.
Starting with 0.6, they are instead located at 183-188.  (This is because the furnace graphics
were changed in Minecraft Beta 1.2.)  So if you modified the furnace block images while using a
pre-0.6 version of pigmap, your modified images can still be found at their old locations in your
blocks-B.png, but they must be copied to the new locations.

A Minecraft client running in a web page. **Live demo at https://webclient.prismarine.js.org/**


## How it Works
prismarine-web-client runs mineflayer and prismarine-viewer in the browser, which connects over WebSocket to a proxy 
which translates the WebSocket connection into TCP to connect to normal Minecraft servers. Prismarine-web-client is based on:
* [prismarine-viewer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-viewer) for the world rendering
* [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) for the high-level Minecraft client API

Check these modules if you want to understand more how it works and contribute!

## Screenshot
![Screenshot of prismarine-web-client in action](screenshot.png)

## Live Demo
Click on this link to open it in your browser, no installation necessary: https://webclient.prismarine.js.org/

*Tested on Chrome & Firefox for desktop platforms.*

## Usage
To host it yourself, run these commands in bash: 
```bash
$ npm install -g prismarine-web-client
$ prismarine-web-client
``` 
Finally, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Features

* Display mobs and players
* Display blocks 
* Movement (you can move, and you see entities moving live)
* Place and break blocks

## Roadmap
* Containers (inventory, chests, etc.)
* Sounds
* More world interactions (attacking entities, etc.)
* Cosmetic rendering features (day night cycle, fog, etc.)

## Development

If you're contributing/making changes, you need to install it differently.

First, clone the repo.

Then, set your working directory to that of the repo. For example:
```bash
$ cd ~/prismarine-web-client/
```

Finally, run

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This will start express and webpack in development mode; whenever you save a file, the build will be redone (it takes 5s), 
and you can refresh the page to get the new result.

Connect to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You may want to disable auto saving in your IDE to avoid constant rebuilding; see https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#adjusting-your-text-editor.

To check the production build (will take a minute to build), you can run `npm run build-start`.

If you're interested in contributing, you can check projects at https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-web-client/projects.

Some variables are exposed in the global ``window`` object for debugging:
* ``bot``
* ``viewer``
* ``mcData``
* ``worldView``
* ``Vec3``
* ``pathfinder``
* ``debugMenu``

### Adding stuff to the debugMenu

debugMenu.customEntries['myKey'] = 'myValue'
delete debugMenu.customEntries['myKey']

### Some debugging examples

In Chrome DevTools:

* `bot.chat('test')` allows you to use the chat
* `bot.chat(JSON.stringify(Object.values(bot.players).map(({username, ping}) => ({username, ping}))))` display the ping of everyone
* `window.bot.entity.position.y += 5` jumps
* `bot.chat(JSON.stringify(bot.findBlock({matching:(block) => block.name==='diamond_ore', maxDistance:256}).position))` finds the position of a diamond block
* `bot.physics.stepHeight = 2` allows you to walk about blocks
* `bot.physics.sprintSpeed = 5` walks faster
* `bot.loadPlugin(pathfinder.pathfinder)` then `bot.pathfinder.goto(new pathfinder.goals.GoalXZ(100, 100))` goes to position 100, 100

For more debugging ideas, read the [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) doc.

此资源包仅适用于**Minecraft Java版**。**关于适用于Minecraft基岩版的资源包，参见[基岩版梗体中文](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/mcwzh-meme-resourcepack-bedrock)。**

**注：若发现可能存在该资源包上头的情况，请立刻~~食用~~阅读[译名标准化](https://minecraft.fandom.com/zh/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki:译名标准化)。**

[![Banner](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/mcwzh-meme-resourcepack/blob/master/materials/zh_meme_banner.png?raw=true)](https://www.mcbbs.net/thread-1004643-1-1.html)

## 作用

这个资源包将一部分译名或其他游戏内字符串替换成了一些知名/不知名的梗或笑话，或将其用诙谐的语言重写了一遍。

## 用法

在[Releases](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/mcwzh-meme-resourcepack/releases)中下载此资源包，或在[网页构建](https://dl.meme.teahou.se/)中选择自定义选项下载。

### 常规

请选择 `mcwzh-meme.zip` 下载，像其他资源包一样复制到你对应的 `.minecraft/resourcepacks/` 目录中（[MCBBS上的教程](https://www.mcbbs.net/thread-880869-1-1.html)）（MultiMC或其他分离版本的启动器请自行查找）。资源包新建了一个语言，安装启用后在语言设置中选择“**梗体中文**”即可体验。

### 加载Mod时

普通版本的资源包**无法**覆盖所有的Mod字符串，会导致大部分Mod的内容**全部变为英文**。请下载 `mcwzh-meme_compatible.zip` ，以保证体验。安装流程几乎相同，只是选择的语言应该是**普通的“简体中文”**。

关于支持梗体中文的Mod，请见[支持的Mod](./list_of_supported_mods.md)页面。

### 1.12.2及以下版本支持

1.13对可翻译字符串进行了一次破坏性更改，这意味着1.12.2及以下无法直接正常使用本资源包。同时，1.12.2及以下版本并不支持读取ASCII格式的Unicode码。通过建立映射表，我们初步实现了1.12.2及以下版本对大部分字符串的支持（也就是除去命令），详见Issue [#34](https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/mcwzh-meme-resourcepack/issues/34)。1.12.2及以下版本请使用带有 `_legacy` 的预设包。

### 对旧版本的兼容

本仓库中的语言文件和最新的Java版的语言文件保持同步。对旧版本，我们采用了“模块”的方式保持兼容。构建时请加入参数 `-r <语言模块名称>` 来将其加入到主语言文件中。[这里](./list_of_language_modules.md)列出了目前所有的语言模块。

### 唱片替换

该资源包将唱片信息修改成了非Minecraft歌曲。由于版权原因，您需要自行制作一个唱片替换资源包（可以参考[这篇文章](https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/how-to-change-music-discs-to-any-song---easy/)）。一份不受支持的预制版唱片替换包（不允许二次分发）可以在[这里](https://files.lakejason0.ml/images/3/34/%E5%94%B1%E7%89%87%E6%9B%BF%E6%8D%A2.zip)获得。

### 不死图腾替换

该资源包将不死图腾替换成了自定义模型。自定义模型范围为 `10800000~10800006` 。如果这不适用于你（例如模型出错，游玩自定义地图或装载其他3D资源包），你可以尝试调整载入顺序，或者下载不带自定义模型的预设构建（以 `_nofigure` 结尾）。如果不想重新下载，你也可以直接删除有自定义模型版本的对应的文件夹。

关于可以直接获取自定义模型的数据包，可以在[这里](https://files.lakejason0.ml/images/e/e5/Figure.zip)，或是在本repo中的`datapack`目录找到。

### “Suitable for work”替换

我们十分理解，一些字符串可能并不适合公开场合的使用。因此为了规避，请在自己构建时在命令结尾加入参数 `--sfw` 以获取一个更加安全的版本。

## 鹦鹉通道

### 体验最新内容

想要**抢先体验**最前沿~~整活~~版本，我们强烈建议您前往[网页打包](https://dl.meme.teahou.se/)，那里可以更直观地选择您需要的内容。

若您仍想自己尝试从命令行打包（并不推荐，比较繁琐），可按以下步骤进行：

#### 先决条件

请确保已经安装了NodeJS主流版本和Git。如果没有，请到[NodeJS官网](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/)和[Git官网](https://www.git-scm.com)下载。

#### 步骤

1. 下载源码；
2. 进入文件夹；
3. 安装相关依赖；
4. 运行预设打包命令。

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/Teahouse-Studios/mcwzh-meme-resourcepack.git
cd mcwzh-meme-resourcepack
npm install
node preset_build.js
```

在 `builds` 文件夹中会生成 `mcwzh-meme.zip` 、 `mcwzh-meme_compatible_sfw.zip` 、 `mcwzh-meme_compatible_nofigure_legacy_sfw.zip` 等预设的资源包，名称和作用如上所述。

### 自助跟进游戏版本

此资源包的语言文件顺序与原版的英文顺序并不一致（本资源包是将key按照字母顺序排序）。如果原版的英文译名跟进了，请先将解包的英文语言文件按照前文所述排序，可以参考[这个网站](https://tool.funsmall.cn/jsonsort/)或本repo中的 `sort.py`。推荐使用[Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)的比较功能以方便查看新字符串。

梗体中文本体文件也可以使用 `sort.py` 进行排序。

如果你是Crowdin上Minecraft项目的翻译者，你也可以随时查看通知来获取新字符串。

![Release](https://github.com/bangbang93/minecraft-proxy/workflows/Release/badge.svg)
![Testing](https://github.com/bangbang93/minecraft-proxy/workflows/Testing/badge.svg)

反向代理Minecraft，完整支持Forge，支持正版登录。若后端服务器是Spigot或者Cauldron，可以通过spigot.yml启用bungeecord模式来获取正确的客户端IP

## 和BungeeCord的区别
minecraft-proxy更像NGINX。
BungeeCord的目标是把多个Minecraft实例用起来像一个，minecraft-proxy的目标是让多个Minecraft实例共享25565端口，就像http应用的虚拟主机。

        ""${workspaceFolder}/."",
        ""--remote-debugging-port=9222""
      ],
      ""webRoot"": ""${workspaceFolder}""
    }
  ]
}
```

This adds two debug configurations.

#### Debug Main Process

This allows you to debug Electron's [main process][mainprocess]. You can debug scripts in the [renderer process][rendererprocess] by opening the DevTools Window.

#### Debug Renderer Process

This allows you to debug Electron's [renderer process][rendererprocess]. This requires you to install the [Debugger for Chrome][chromedebugger] extension.

Note that you **cannot** open the DevTools window while using this debug configuration. Chromium only allows one debugger, opening another will crash the program.

Minecraft - Stuff Library
=========================

An extension library of useful 'stuff' (aka classes) I have created for Minecraft: Pi Edition's API.  

It provides functions for drawing lines, creating, moving and rotating shapes and a pretty cool turtle.  Check out the `documentation`_ and `examples`_.

|minecraftstuff|

Created by `Martin O'Hanlon`_, `@martinohanlon`_, `stuffaboutco.de`_.

Install
=========================

Open a terminal and run the following commands::

    sudo pip install minecraftstuff
    sudo pip3 install minecraftstuff

Code
=========================

See the `documentation`_ for more information, but below is a summary.

MinecraftDrawing
-------------------------

::

    from minecraftstuff import MinecraftDrawing
    from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
    from mcpi import block

    #Connect to minecraft
    mc = Minecraft.create()
    # get the players position
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()

    #Using the Minecraft Drawing API
    mcdrawing = MinecraftDrawing(mc)
    
    # draw a circle with a radius of 10 blocks
    mcdrawing.drawCircle(pos.x, pos.y + 15, pos.z, 10, block.WOOD.id)

MinecraftShape
-------------------------

::

    from minecraftstuff import MinecraftShape
    from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
    from mcpi import block
    from time import sleep

    #Connect to minecraft
    mc = Minecraft.create()
    # get the players position
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()

    #Using the Minecraft Shape API
    mcshape = MinecraftShape(mc, pos)

    # create a stone cube
    mcshape.setBlocks(-5, -5, -5, 5, 5, 5, block.STONE.id)
    
    # move it around
    for i in range(0,10):
        mcshape.moveBy(1,0,1)
        sleep(0.5)


MinecraftTurtle
-------------------------

::

    from minecraftstuff import MinecraftTurtle
    from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft

    #Connect to minecraft
    mc = Minecraft.create()
    # get the players position
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()

    #Using the Minecraft Turtle
    steve = MinecraftTurtle(mc, pos)
    
    # draw a square 
    steve.forward(5)
    steve.right(90)
    steve.forward(5)
    steve.right(90)
    steve.forward(5)
    steve.right(90)

229,montoyo/mcef,Java,"# MCEF
Minecraft Chromium Embedded Framework (MCEF) is an API to allow Minecraft Modders to add custom web browsers into Minecraft.
The project was initialy made for WebDisplays (www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1291044-web-displays-browse-on-the-internet-in-minecraft).
It is based on JCEF (https://code.google.com/p/javachromiumembedded/), which is based on CEF (https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/java-cef) which is based on chromium (http://www.chromium.org).

# Features
- 2D & 3D web view rendering (not only in GUIs)
- Java -> JavaScript (IBrowser.runJavaScript)
- JavaScript -> Java (IJSQueryHandler)
- Embedded files (mod://modname/file.html => /assets/modname/html/file.html)
- HTML5, CSS3 are supported.

# What can I do with this?
- If you're tired of Minecraft's GuiScreen, you can make a HTML/JS/CSS GUI.
- Open a link to your wiki.
- Whatever you want, but please not a WebDisplays clone.

# Currently supported platforms
Right now MCEF supports Windows 32 and 64 bits. I'll compile JCEF for linux as soon as possible. However I can't compile it for Mac.
If you want to compile the natives for Mac, you can follow the instructions here: https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/java-cef/wiki/BranchesAndBuilding

# For players
This is the Github project of MCEF; here you can only read the source code of it.
You can download the mod in its latest version from here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2324969-minecraft-chromium-embedded-framework-mcef

# For modders
**DONT** copy the net.montoyo.mcef.api package into your project. Instead, download the latest API release from https://github.com/montoyo/mcef/releases and put it in the libs folder. Users will have to download the mod from the MinecraftForum thread.
To understand how it works, you may look at the net.montoyo.mcef.example package, which demos:
* The IBrowser interface, how to draw it and control it
* The IJSQueryHandler interface, how to handle JavaScript queries
* The IDisplayHandler interface, how to handle browser URL changes
* How to use the mod:// scheme

# For forkers
Don't forget to add ""-Dfml.coreMods.load=net.montoyo.mcef.coremod.ShutdownPatcher"" to the VM options, otherwise the Java process will hang forever!

# A bedrock Minecraft PE Server on Docker

This documentation is for image lomot/minecraft-bedrock:1.19.51.01

## Start the server

#### 1. Install Docker in your server

```bash
apt install docker.io
```

or you can follow this documentation : [How to install Docker]

#### 2. Create a folder for server data

This folder is for your world data and some configuration files, it contains `permissions.json`,`server.properties`,`allowlist.json`,`worlds`, if you use an empty folder, all the files will be created automatically, for example `/opt/mcpe-data`

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/mcpe-data
```

#### 3. Deploy the server

```bash
docker run -itd --restart=always --name=mcpe --net=host \
  -v /opt/mcpe-data:/data \
  lomot/minecraft-bedrock:1.19.51.01
```

## Upgrade the server

#### 1. Backup your data

Backup the folder `/opt/mcpe-data`

```bash
cp -r /opt/mcpe-data /opt/mcpe-data.bak
```

#### 2. Exit and delete the old container

```bash
docker container stop mcpe
docker container rm mcpe
```

#### 3. Start a new container

```bash
docker run -itd --restart=always --name=mcpe --net=host \
  -v /opt/mcpe-data:/data \
  lomot/minecraft-bedrock:1.19.51.01
```

## Manage the server

### Enter or quit the game console

```bash
docker attach mcpe
```

To quit, press `ctrl + p + q`

Use `ctrl + c` or `ctrl + d`to kill the process

### Use this command to stop/start/restart/rm the server

```bash
docker container stop/start/restart/rm mcpe
```

### Change the server port

To change the server port, update `server-port` in the file`server.properties`

Using bridge networks will decrease the network performance, it is supposed to use host networks.

### About addons, behavior_packs and resource_packs

There are too many files about addons to configure, so I made another image, to use this image, you need to manage server folder by yourself, such as update and configuration files, you can download the server files here [Minecraft server].

How to use:

```bash
docker run -itd --restart=always --name=mcpe --net=host \
  -v /opt/mcpe-data:/mcpe \
  lomot/minecraft-bedrock:base
```

# BedwarsRel - Minecraft Bedwars Plugin
![](https://github.com/BedwarsRel/BedwarsRel/blob/master/logo.png)

Bedwars is a [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net) minigame where teams (max. 15) try to destroy the other teams' beds. But there is more: On the whole map there are ressource spawners spawning items. Some items are more worth than others and with these you can buy different things in the so called ""Villager Shop"". You will find powerful weapons or potions or simple blocks to get to the other bases. Get to the others bases? Yes, every team starts on an island and you have to get to the others with blocks which you can buy in the ""Villager Shop"". When you meet a enemy you have to try to kill him so he'll lose all the equipment which he had in his inventory. As soon as a team's bed is destroyed they cannot respawn again and last team standing wins.

236,Railcraft/Railcraft,Java,"# Railcraft - A Minecraft Mod

Here you will find the source and issue tracker for the **Official Railcraft Project**.


## What is Railcraft?

Railcraft is a mod written for the hit game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/). It is built on top of the [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge) API.

It greatly expands and improves the Minecart system in Minecraft. Adding many new blocks, entities, and features. It has been in development since 2012 and contains over 800 class files and hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

The mod was created and is still currently maintained by the user going by the name **CovertJaguar**.

## Why are you posting the Source Code?

In the words of **CovertJaguar**:
> As a new modder, I originally feared losing control of my code, my brainchild. However, since that time, I have had the privelege of being Project Lead on two other major Minecraft Mod projects that provided access to the source: [Buildcraft](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft) and [Forestry](https://github.com/ForestryMC/ForestryMC). I've generally found this to be a positive experience resulting in many bug fixes and increased intermod compatibility.  While I still have some concerns, I have come to feel that the benefits of providing others access to my source code outweigh the negatives and unknowns. To that end, despite my misgivings, I made Source Access a [Patreon Milestone Goal](http://www.patreon.com/CovertJaguar). I had no idea whether I'd ever meet that Goal, but I decided to let the community decide, and decide they did, overwhelmingly so! My Patrons are awesome. So, as promised, I am posting the Source Code.

You must have read and performed the proper support procedure outlined [here](http://railcraft.info/wiki/info:support) before posting.

More information about issue Labels can be found [here](https://github.com/CovertJaguar/Railcraft/wiki/Issue-Labels).

## Contributing

The Official Railcraft Project welcomes contributions from anyone, provided they have signed the Contributor Licensing Agreement (CLA) found [here](https://cla-assistant.io/CovertJaguar/Railcraft).

Signing the CLA is simple, just follow the link, and hit the ""I Agree"" button and you are good to go.

Regarding new features/behavior changes, please submit a Suggestion Issue to the Tracker before you write a single line of code. Keeping everyone on the same page saves time and effort and reduces negative experiences all around when a change turns out to be controversial.

Also, as a bonus. If you submit a Pull Request that ends up being merged you are eligible to receive beta access. To redeem, contact CovertJaguar on IRC.

## Building

The Railcraft Project follows standard Forge conventions for setting up and building a project, with a couple additional details (details to come).

You can create a gradle.properties file in the project root with the following properties:
```
mcUsername=Steve
mcPassword=ILoveNotch
```

Initial Setup from the Command Line:
```
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```

The [API](https://github.com/CovertJaguar/Railcraft-API) and [Localization](https://github.com/CovertJaguar/Railcraft-Localization) files reside in their own repositories and are pulled automatically into the main repo as git submodules. You will however need to run the following commands:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

For more information on setting up an Intellij modding environement see cpw's video:
https://youtu.be/G2aPT36kf60

To build, run:
```
gradlew build
```

# Wisdom
“Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place where gold is refined. Iron is taken from the earth, And copper is smelted from ore.

Man puts an end to darkness, And searches every recess for ore in the darkness and the shadow of creepers. He breaks open a shaft away from villages; In places forgotten by feet they dig far away from villagers; They jump to and fro.

As for the earth, from it comes bread, But underneath it is turned up by fire and lava; Its stones are the source of emeralds, And it contains redstone dust. That path no bird knows, Nor has the parrot’s eye seen it. The proud ocelot has not trodden it, Nor has the fierce wolf passed over it.

He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the roots. He cuts out channels in the rocks, And his eye sees every precious thing. He dams up the streams from trickling; What is hidden he brings forth to light.

But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? Man does not know its value, Nor is it found in the Nether or the End. The void says, ‘It is not in me’; And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’ It cannot be purchased for gold, Nor can silver be weighed for its price. It cannot be valued in stars, in precious obsidian or the heart of the sea. Neither gold nor crystal can equal it, Nor can it be exchanged for jewelry of fine gold. No mention shall be made of coral or quartz, For the price of wisdom is above emeralds. Lapis Lazuli cannot equal it, Nor can it be valued in ingots of gold.

From where then does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding? It is hidden from the eyes of all living, And concealed from the birds of the air. If you search through the bones and question the dead, they say, 'we've heard only rumors of it.'

God understands its way, And He knows its place. For He looks to the ends of the earth, And sees under the whole heavens, To establish a weight for the wind, And apportion the waters by measure. When He made a law for the rain, And a path for the thunderbolt, Then He saw wisdom and declared it; He prepared it, indeed, He searched it out.

And to man He said, ‘Behold, the reverence and love of the Lord, that is wisdom, And to depart from evil is understanding.’ ”

Job 28:1‭-‬28 (Minecraft Edition)

In Minecraft 1.8 Armor stands were introduced. Unfortunately, the syntax to summon one is quite confusing and not very intuitive, especially when you're trying to create an awesome pose. This tool provides a graphical interface so that you can focus on the looks and not worry about the code.

`mcpi` Python library for communicating with [Minecraft: Pi edition](https://minecraft.net/en-us/edition/pi/) and [RaspberryJuice](https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice).

## Installation

### Windows

```
pip3 install mcpi
```

### Linux / MacOS

```bash
sudo pip3 install mcpi
```

## History

The [Minecraft: Pi edition](https://minecraft.net/en-us/edition/pi/) Python library was originally created by Mojang and released with Minecraft: Pi edition.

Initial supported was provided for Python 2 only, but during a sprint at PyconUK 2014 it was migrated to Python 3 and [py3minepi](https://github.com/py3minepi/py3minepi) was created.

The ability to hack Minecraft from Python was very popular and the [RaspberryJuice](https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice) plugin was created for Minecraft Java edition. RaspberryJuice also extended the API adding additional features.

This python library supports Python 2 & 3 and Minecraft: Pi edition and RaspberryJuice.

Documentation for the Minecraft: Pi edition and RaspberryJuice API's can be found at [www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft-api-reference.html](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft-api-reference.html).

It was released onto [PyPI](https://pypi.org) in May 2018.

=========

This readme is intended for developers. For downloads and gameplay instructions please see the [official website](http://www.vivecraft.org/)


Using this Repository
========
 
 Vivecraft uses patches to avoid distributing Minecraft code. The build scripts are in Python 2.X.
 
 - Fork, checkout or download the repo using your Git method of choice.
 - Install Java JDK 1.8. The Java JRE will NOT work.
 - Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK directory
 - Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to your PATH environment variable
 - Install Python 2.7.x (NOT 3.x). Be sure to tick the 'add python to your PATH' option during install. [Download from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - Open a command prompt and navigate to the repo directory
 - Run install.bat
 
The install process (install.py) does a number of things:
 - It downloads MCP (Minecraft coder's pack) and extracts it to the \mcp9xx\ directory.
 - It downloads a ton of dependencies.
 - It merges Optifine into vanilla minecraft jar.
 - It decompiles and deobfuscates the combined minecraft/optifine into \mcp9xx\src\.minecraft_orig_nofix\
 - It applies any patches found in \mcppatches\ and copies the result to\mcp9xx\src\.minecraft_orig\
 - It applies all the patches found in \patches\ and copies the result to \mcp9xx\src\minecraft\. 
 - It copies all code files found in \src\ to \mcp9xx\src\minecraft\. 
 - It copies all files found in \assets\ to \mcp9xx\src\assets\.
 This directory is now the full 'Vivecraft' codebase.
 
If you use Eclipse you can open the workspace found in \mcp9xx\eclipse. You will have to correct the library path for the vanilla jar and realms jar, and also add libraries for JRift, json, asm, and launchwrapper, all of these can be found in the root /lib folder. To run the game from eclipse you also have to attach natives to the lwjgl jar (from lib/natives).

Make all changes to the game in the \mcp9xx\src\minecraft directory.

To update code to Github:
========
 - run getchanges.bat. This compares mcp9xx\src\minecraft to mcp9xx\src\minecraft_orig. patches are generated for modified files and copied to \patches\. Whole new files are copied to \src\.
 - Push to Github.
 
To build an installer:
========
 - run build.bat. This runs getchanges, build, and then create_install. Basically it takes the new files and patches and creates a jar. And then it uses the code and jsons found in \installer\ to make an installer.exe.

To update changes from github
========
  - After pulling changes from github run applychanges.bat. This backs up mcp9xx\src\minecraft to mcp9xx\src\minecraft_bak, and starts over by applying all patches in \patches\ to mcp9xx\src\minecraft_orig, and copies the result o mcp9xx\src\minecraft
  
Caveats - Maintaining Forge Compatibility
========
When Vivecraft is run with Forge, any public method can be called by any mod, and any vanilla class is up for grabs for ASM modification. To this end, please follow these guidelines in writing Vivecraft code:
 - Do not rename any vanilla methods, fields, or classes
 - Do not change the type or signatures of any vanilla members.
 - Keep modification to vanilla methods minimal, move code to your own methods, preferrably in your own files.

Additionally, vivecraft does not use bytecode manipulation at runtime to modify the vanilla classes (mostly), it replaces them wholesale in much the same way as optifine. It only replaces files that have been modified by the user, and it replaces them after Forge and Optifine have made their modifications to them. This means that any vanilla class you modify will NOT have any of Forge's code changes made to it at runtime. To fix this, the class must have all Forge's method calls added via reflection in Vivecraft. Optifine uses this method extensively and Vivecraft expands it. 

Before making ANY changes to a vanilla class file you should check to see:
  - Is the class already modified by Vivecraft? You can tell if there is a .patch file for it on github. If so: feel free to make any other changes.
  - Is the class already modified by Optifine? You can tell because there will usually be calls to Reflector.java. If Optifine has already made the Reflection calls, continue with your edits.
  - Is the class modfied by Forge? - Check Forge's github patches to see, Forge modifies many base classes but not all. If the class is not modified by Forge, feel free to edit it.
  - If the class is modified by Forge, and neither Vivecraft, nor Optifine have added the Reflection calls, you will have to do so along with your own changes. See Reflector.java for numerous examples.

## Prerequisites
* [Java] 8

## Clone
The following steps will ensure your project is cloned properly.

1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/SpongePowered/Sponge.git`
2. `cd Sponge`
3. `cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks`

## Setup
**Note**: Sponge uses [Gradle] as its build system. The repo includes the Gradle wrapper that will automatically download the correct Gradle 
version. Local installations of Gradle may work (as long as they are using Gradle 6.8+) but are untested. To execute the Gradle wrapper, run the 
`./gradlew` script on Unix systems or only `gradlew` on Windows systems.

To have browsable sources for use in-IDE, run `./gradlew :decompile`. This command will need to be re-ran after any change to
Minecraft version or to `.accesswidener` files. If sources are not appearing properly, an IDE refresh should fix things.

### IDE Setup
__For [Eclipse]__
 1. Make sure the Buildship plugin is installed (available on the [Eclipse Marketplace])
 2. Import the project as an *Existing Gradle Project* (via File > Import > Gradle)

While we do our best to support any IDE, most of our developers use IntelliJ, so issues may pop up with Eclipse from time to time.
We'll be happy to work to resolve those issues if reported via [our issues page][Issues] or fixed via PR.

__For [IntelliJ]__
  1. Make sure you have the Gradle plugin enabled (File > Settings > Plugins).  
  2. Click File > New > Project from Existing Sources > Gradle and select the root folder for Sponge.
  3. Make sure _Use default gradle wrapper_ is selected. Older/newer Gradle versions may work but we only test using the wrapper.

For both Eclipse and IntelliJ, a variety of run configurations will be generated which allow running the client and server in development. These run 
configurations will be re-generated on each project import, so any desired modifications should be done on copies of the configurations.

While these run configurations have Java versions attached to them, be aware that IntelliJ ignores that information entirely, and Eclipse will 
only be able to align those java versions with whatever JREs it is aware of.

## Building

In order to build Sponge you simply need to run the `gradlew build` command. On Windows systems you should run `gradlew build` instead 
of `./gradlew build` to invoke the Gradle wrapper. You can find the compiled JAR files in `./build/libs` and `./vanilla/build/libs`.

## Updating your Clone
The following steps will update your clone with the official repo.

1. `git pull`
2. `git submodule update --recursive`
3. `./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies`

246,Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed,Python,"# Vanilla-Normals-Renewed
A shaders compatible minecraft texture pack, based on vanilla but with normals and proper glossiness information.
This resourcepack is compatible with both the ""oldPBR"" and ""labPBR"" standards, and should work correctly with most shaders.

⚠️ This version is made for Minecraft 1.16 and above ⚠️

**For the easy download (2 versions late) just go to ""Releases"" 👉**

## Description

I didn't want any of those fancy high-resolution texture packs in order to enjoy normal mapping and specular highlights.
So I decided to make my own, but based on vanilla textures.

This texture pack is free for everyone to use! However if you wish to support me, you can join my Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/Poudingue

## Copyright

You can do whatever you want with my texture pack, screenshots, videos, modifications for personal use or redistribution, as long as you don't sell it and provide a link to this page or my Patreon page. Oh, and also, don't mix it with Realistico. Dead serious. Absolutely not a joke. This is not irony, I really insist. I will sue you. 

## Screenshots

⚠️ The screenshots provided here were made with SEUS renewed, an an old version of minecraft, the results will differ with other shaders ⚠️

Textures have bump mapping information, allowing parallax occlusion mapping and normal mapping.
Smoothness information is very important for the credibility of materials too, especially when the sun lights it at grazing angles.

![Normals and smoothness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18035775/64910219-244f3800-d714-11e9-9101-7651afb13ced.png)
Screenshot taken in SEUS renewed 1.0

Metals and smooth materials now have the correct information to compute reflections.
SEUS renewed heavily relies on Screen Space Reflections for this and don't take correctly roughness surfaces for it, so the reflections may be too shiny and imperfect. However using SEUS PTGI will provide Path-Traced reflections and indirect lighting, and correctly take into account roughness.

![Metal and smooth materials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18035775/64910220-2618fb80-d714-11e9-9315-f0c6e72ff281.png)
Screenshot taken in SEUS PTGI E9

## Installation

- Install a shader supporting normal and specular mapping. If you don't know which one, give this one a shot : https://sonicether.com/seus/ and if you want raytracing, it should also work properly with SEUS PTGI HRR : https://www.patreon.com/sonicether

### BRAND NEW zip-based Method (if you don't know how to use git)

1. On this page, click on «Release», on the top of the screen.
2. Pick the version you want and download the zip in the «assets» zone.
2. Go to the minecraft folder
    - For windows, go to ""%appdata%/.minecraft"" on your start menu.
    - For Linux, go to ""~/.minecraft"" in your file explorer.
    - For Mac OS, go to ""~/Library/Application Support/minecraft"" in your file explorer
3. Go into the «resourcepacks» folder. Create it if it doesn't exist
4. Put the zip you downloaded here.
5. Select the right shader and resourcepack in minecraft options.
6. (for PTGI and other shaderpacks needing resolution adjustment) : set ""Texture resolution"" to ×16
7. Enjoy !

### GIT powered Install Method (

Git is a version control software that github uses to manage all the code that they host, which can be used to make installation really easy.
Version Control software allows multiple authors to collaborate, and track all the changes made, and who made what changes

#### Linux Git Install
    1. To do this, you will first need to open a terminal window
    2. Then verify that git is installed by running `git --version` This will make sure that it is installed, and additionally, show what version is installed
        - If you get an output that looks like `git version 2.21.0` then it is installed.
        - If you get an output like this `bash: git: command not found` (Different shells will appear different, but most will basically state that the command wasn't found.) Different Distros have different approaches to installing software, if you're having trouble look up ""<insert Linux Distro Here> Install git""
    3. Once you have certified git is installed, move your terminal to the folder `~/.minecraft/resourcepacks` by running `cd ~/.minecraft/resourcepacks`
    4. After you're in the right folder, run 'git clone https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed.git` to clone the entire repository to your computer.
        - You will not need to zip the repo to have it work, Minecraft can handle unzipped texture packs.

##### Linux Git Update
    1. Please have installed the texture pack using the above guide. This won't work if you went on github, downloaded the Zip, and extracted it.
    2. Open up a terminal
    3. Change to the TEXTURE PACK'S folder by running `cd ~/.minecraft/resourcepacks/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed`
    4. Run `git pull origin' to download the latest version.
        - You might want to relaunch Minecraft after this to make sure it uses the latest textures.


#### Windows Git Install
    1. Install Git and add to the path (don't' worry there is a guide below)
        1. Open a web browser and [download](https://git-scm.com/download/win) the latest version of git
        2. Run the installer
            - When it comes to the ""Adjusting your PATH environment"" the middle option is recommended, as it allow for more flexibility, but doesn't cause problems.
            - When it comes to the ""Configuring the line ending conventions"", set it to ""Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings""
                - Linux and Windows use different line ending in text files, and this will prevent any problems.
            - When it comes to the "" Configuring the Terminal Emulator to use with Git Bash"" the Windows one is sufficient for most work
        3. Once it is installed, launch command prompt
            - Press the Windows key + ""R"", to open a run box, then type in cmd.exe, and press enter
        4. Change to the resourcepack folder using the command  `cd %AppData%/.minecraft/resourcepacks`
        5. Clone the repository to your computer by running git clone https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed.git
            - You will not need to zip the repo to have it work, Minecraft can handle unzipped texture packs.

##### Windows Git Update
    1. Please have installed the texture pack using the above guide. This won't work if you went on github, downloaded the Zip, and extracted it.
    2. Open up command prompt
        - Press the Windows key + ""R"", to open a run box, then type in cmd.exe, and press enter
    3. Change to the TEXTURE PACK'S folder by running `cd %appdata%/.minecraft/resourcepacks/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed`
    4. Then run `git pull origin' to download the latest version.
        - You might want to relaunch Minecraft after this to make sure it uses the latest textures.

To update, run `go get` with the `-u` option.

Requires `csfml` libraries and headers to build.

## What works

* Connecting to servers
* Online mode
* Rendering most blocks
* Block model support

## What doesn't work

* 99% of Minecraft's features

## Running

### Via the Offical Minecraft launcher

![Profile example](http://i.imgur.com/NBMGhPL.png)

You need to create a new profile (or edit an existing one) on the Minecraft 
launcher and modify the profile to look like the above but replace the path
to steven with the location you built it at or downloaded it too and change the 
`server` parameter to the target server. Currently only works in online mode
(with no plans for offline mode currently). If the `server` parameter isn't
passed then a server list will be displayed.

### Standalone

Just running steven via a double click (Windows) or `./steven` (everything else)
will bring up a login screen followed by a server list which you can select a server
from.

Providing a username, uuid and access token via the command line as followed:
  `--username <username> --uuid <uuid> --accessToken <access token>`
will skip the login screen and jump straight to the server list. Providing a
server address via `--server <server>:<port>` will skip the server list and 
connect straight to the server. As it currently stands providing all the arguments
allows for the client to parallelise connecting to the server and loading the 
textures/models/other assets as a 'quick connect'.

* [Community Discord]
* [Community IRC]: [#sponge on irc.esper.net]
* [Development IRC]: [#spongedev on irc.esper.net]
* [Preparing for Development]

## Prerequisites
* [Java] 8

## Cloning
The following steps will ensure your project is cloned properly.

1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeVanilla.git`
2. `cd SpongeVanilla`
3. `cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks`

**Note**: If you accidentally omit `--recursive` option when cloning, you may
delete the repository and try again, or you may execute the following to fix the
situation:

	git submodule update --init --recursive

## Setup
**Note**: SpongeVanilla uses [Gradle] as its build system. The repo includes the Gradle wrapper that will automatically download the correct Gradle 
version. Local installations of Gradle may work but are untested. To execute the Gradle wrapper, run the `./gradlew` script on Unix systems or only
`gradlew` on Windows systems.

Before you are able to build SpongeVanilla, you must first prepare the environment:

  - Run `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies`

### IDE Setup
__For [Eclipse]__
  1. Run `./gradlew eclipse`
  2. Import SpongeVanilla as an existing project (File > Import > General)
  3. Select the root folder for SpongeVanilla and make sure `Search for nested projects` is enabled
  4. Check SpongeVanilla when it finishes building and click **Finish**

__For [IntelliJ]__
  1. Make sure you have the Gradle plugin enabled (File > Settings > Plugins. For **macOS** users: IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences > Plugins).  
  2. Click File > New > Project from Existing Sources > Gradle and select the root folder for SpongeVanilla.
  3. Make sure _Use default gradle wrapper_ is selected. Older/newer Gradle versions may work but we only test using the wrapper.

## Running
__Note:__ The following is aimed to help you setup run configurations for Eclipse and IntelliJ, if you do not want to be able to run SpongeVanilla directly from your IDE then you can skip this.

__For [Eclipse]__ 
  1. Running `./gradlew eclipse` should have generated the run configurations automatically.
  2. When launching the server for the first time, it will shutdown by itself. You will need to modify eula.txt to set eula=true (this means you agree to the Mojang EULA, if you do not wish to do this then you cannot run the server).

__For [IntelliJ]__
  1. Run `./gradlew genIntelliJRuns`
  2. Restart IntelliJ IDEA or reload the project, the run configuration should now be generated.
  3. When launching the server for the first time, it will shutdown by itself. You will need to modify eula.txt to set eula=true (this means you agree to the Mojang EULA, if you do not wish to do this then you cannot run the server).

## Building
__Note:__ You must [setup the environment](#setup) before you can build SpongeVanilla.

In order to build SpongeVanilla you simply need to run the `gradlew` command. On Windows systems you should run `gradlew` instead of `./gradlew` to
invoke the Gradle wrapper. You can find the compiled JAR files in `./build/libs`. You can find the compiled JAR files in `./build/libs` but in most cases
you'll only need 'spongevanilla-x.x.x-x.x-x.jar'.

## Updating your Clone
The following steps will update your clone with the official repo.

1. `git pull`
2. `git submodule update --recursive`
3. `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies`

## FAQ
__A dependency was added, but my IDE is missing it! How do I add it?__
>If a new dependency was added, you can just restart your IDE and the Gradle plugin for that IDE should pull in the new dependencies.

## Contributing
Are you a talented programmer looking to contribute some code? We'd love the help!
* Open a pull request with your changes, following our [guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Please follow the above guidelines for your pull request(s) to be accepted.

__Help! Things are not working!__
>Some issues can be resolved by deleting the '.gradle' folder in your user directory and running through the setup steps again, or even running `gradle cleanCache` and running through the setup again.

# LevelDb2Anvil

Convert **Minecraft: Pocket Edition Maps(_LevelDB_)** to **Minecraft Maps(_Anvil_)**.

## Info:

Latest version(v2.0) works for maps generated by Minecraft: Pocket Edition 1.0 or later.

Blocks have different ID in PC and PE will be converted into correct ID, no worry.

For Minecraft: Pocket Edition before v1.0 and after v0.9, consider using last build(v1.0).

Any question, bug or advice, feel free to talk with me at [here](https://github.com/ljyloo/LevelDb2Avnil/issues).

## Known Issues:

- ~~Block light and sky light will always be 15 (Still don't know how to get the data from Mojang's LevelDB database so I just set it 15)~~
  Checkout [here](https://github.com/ljyloo/LevelDb2Avnil/pull/19)
- **No entities**
- **Player will not spawn at the same coordinate like before**
- **Items in the chest will disappear**
- ~~No biome~~
- **Lag when first time load**
- **Crash(super rare!)**

## Usage:

### Video tutorial
There's a video tutorial about this(Made by AntVenom): [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFAkc5L4h48)

### Auto script
Import your LevelDB world in and rename it to the name 'world'.
Run start.bat(if you're on Windows) or start.sh(if you're on OS X or Linux) and the converter will now convert it to Anvil format to the output folder of 'worldanvil'.

### Command line interface
If you were familiar with command line interface, using the Converter.jar like this(You may want to [install java runtime first](java.com)): 

```
java -jar Converter.jar <import folder> <export folder>
```

## Todo

- [ ] **Fix light data**
- [ ] **Fix player coordinate**
- [ ] **Fix entities**
- [ ] **Fix items contained in the chest**
- [x] **Fix biome**
- [x] **Refactor the code**
- [ ] **Graphical user interface**

## Screenshots:

The mca files generated by the program stores your maps data. They can be found in an usual Minecraft world folder:

![](pic/saves_folder.jpg)
![](pic/region_folder.jpg)

Create a superflat new world and copy the mca files into it, open the game and locate your chunks.(Press F3 to see your location)
Don't worry if you were seeing the flat chunks again, the coordinate of your original chunk in the MCPE is exactly the same in here too, you may want to use teleport command to find the chunks.

## Credits:

This program uses leveldb by tinfoiled. See lisense [here](https://github.com/ljyloo/leveldb)

This program contains code from Mojang: source at [here](https://mojang.com/2012/02/new-minecraft-map-format-anvil/)

User-friendly start.bat/start.sh, the folder 'worldanvil' was by @keithkfng.

Thanks AntVenom for making a video tutorial.

by Jamie Bainbridge <<jamie.bainbridge@gmail.com>>

This is an initscript to run a Minecraft or CraftBukkit server on CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu.

### Note

As of 2015, this script is no longer actively maintained. All the supported distros are moving to systemd, making the concept of an LSB initscript rather outdated. All issues I see are related to bugs in Ubuntu's implementation of Upstart, it works perfectly on CentOS. However I think you are much better learning to use containers like Docker to control a single process and its files. There are many instructions around the internet on how to do this.

Thanks to all supporters over the years. You are welcome to fork this repo if you wish to continue development.

### Features

*   Start, stop, restart CraftBukkit as a system service
*   Automatic (via cron) and manual logfile rotation
*   Automatic (via cron) and manual backups
*   Backup compression and rotation (keeps 7 days worth of backups)
*   Allows use of third-party backup solutions
*   Check latest Recommended Build and update to it if required
*   Information display including Java path, current memory usage, current TCP connections
*   Able to run multiple separate instances of the server at once

### Supported Distributions

*   CentOS 6, CentOS 5, Fedora 14 (probably works on Fedora Core 6 and later, untested)
*   Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS

Other distros which use SysV Init or Upstart will probably work.

Distros using systemd (Fedora 15+, Arch Linux, etc) may not work.

### Requirements

*   `screen`, `rsync`

    (you may need to install these)

*   `bash`, `chkconfig` or `sysv-rc`, `coreutils`, `cronie`, `curl`, `diffutils`, `grep`, `initscripts`, `net-tools`, `procps`, `tar`

  (these should all be installed by default)

*   Oracle Java 7

*   Enough disk space to save your map twice, plus another ~5 times for a week of compressed backup space.

  ie: If your map is 1Gb then you probably need at least 7Gb, plus any space your plugins require and any additional backups you'll be making.

### Installation

As the root user:

*   Install Sun Java (CentOS/Fedora)

    Download the RPM from <http://www.java.com/>

    `yum localinstall jre-<version>.rpm`

*   Install Sun Java (Ubuntu)

    ~~~
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
    ~~~

*   Confirm your JVM installation

    ~~~
    java -version
    ~~~

*   Create a new user with a home directory

    ~~~
    useradd -m bukkit
    ~~~
    
*   Save the script as `/etc/init.d/minecraft` and make it executable

    ~~~
    chmod +x /etc/init.d/minecraft
    ~~~
    
*   Copy between the `<<COMMENT` and `COMMENT` lines and place the copy at `/etc/default/minecraft`

    If you need to edit settings, edit the `/etc/default/minecraft` file, not the initscript

*   Allow the bukkit user to run the init script without needing root access

    Type `visudo` and add this line to the bottom:

    ~~~
    bukkit localhost=NOPASSWD:/etc/init.d/minecraft*
    ~~~

*   Create an alias so you only have to type `minecraft` to run the script

    Add the following line to both root and bukkit's `~/.bashrc` file:

    ~~~
    alias minecraft='/etc/init.d/minecraft'
    ~~~

*   Start the server on system boot if desired (CentOS/Fedora)
  
    ~~~
    chkconfig --add minecraft
    chkconfig minecraft on
    ~~~

*   Start the server on system boot if desired (Ubuntu)

    ~~~
    update-rc.d minecraft defaults
    ~~~

As the regular user, bukkit:

*   Make the required paths

    ~~~
    mkdir -p ~/backups && mkdir -p ~/craftbukkit
    ~~~

*   Put your `craftbukkit.jar`, world, plugins, `server.properties`, etc into `~/craftbukkit`

### Backups

*   Create cron jobs to do regular backups and rotations around 4am

    Type `crontab -e` to open the cron interface and add the following

    ~~~
     0 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft backup              # backup world at 4:00am
     5 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft logrotate           # rotate logs at 4:05am
    15 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft removeoldbackups    # remove old backups at 4:30am
    ~~~

*   If you have multiple worlds, you can pass the worldname as a parameter to the regular backup

    ~~~
     0 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft backup world1       # backup world1 at 4:00am
     5 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft logrotate           # rotate logs at 4:05am
    15 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft backup world2       # backup world2 at 4:15am
    30 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft removeoldbackups    # remove old backups at 4:30am
    ~~~

*   If you wish to use a third-party backup solution, just disable world writes

    ~~~
    minecraft save-off
    ~~~

    Then run your backup tool. Then re-enable world writes

    ~~~
    minecraft save-on
    ~~~

### Multiple Instances

It is possible to run multiple instances, for example a Creative server and a Survival server, on the same system.

*   Copy the script to two new files

    ~~~
    cp /etc/init.d/minecraft /etc/init.d/minecraft-creative
    cp /etc/init.d/minecraft /etc/init.d/minecraft-survival
    ~~~

*   Edit the `Provides` section on Line 6 to the same as the new filename

    ~~~
    # Provides: minecraft-creative
    # Provides: minecraft-survival
    ~~~

*   Create a settings file for each instance in `/etc/default/` using the same name as the script

    ~~~
    /etc/default/minecraft-creative
    /etc/default/minecraft-creative
    ~~~

*   Set an alias for each server in `~/.bashrc`

    ~~~
    alias creative='/etc/init.d/minecraft-creative'
    alias survival='/etc/init.d/minecraft-survival'
    ~~~

*   Add the new scripts to `chkconfig` or `update-rc.d`

*   Set the paths of the separate maps in each script

    ~~~
    MCPATH=""/home/bukkit/craftbukkit-creative""
    MCPATH=""/home/bukkit/craftbukkit-survival""
    ~~~
 
*   Change your screen session names in each script

    ~~~
    SCRNAME=""creative""
    SCRNAME=""survival""
    ~~~

### Usage

*   Start the server

    ~~~
    minecraft start
    ~~~

*   Stop the server

    ~~~
    minecraft stop
    ~~~

*   Restart the server

    ~~~
    minecraft restart
    ~~~

*   Back up the map and executable

    ~~~
    minecraft backup
    ~~~

    The final compressed backup is done when the `.md5` file appears in the backup directory.

*   Back up multiple maps

    ~~~
    minecraft backup world1
    minecraft backup world2
    ~~~

*   Check the server is running

    ~~~
    minecraft status
    ~~~

*   Get some more info

    ~~~
    minecraft info

    * CraftBukkit (pid 9037) is running...
    - Java Path : /usr/java/jre1.6.0_31/bin/java
    - Start Command : java -Xms512M -Xmx3584M -jar craftbukkit.jar nogui

## History
Lusin HATES lagging in Minecraft!!!

Long ago, Lusin had a bad computer.  The computer was so slow and couldn't even run Minecraft at a good FPS (60fps bare minimum).  Everyone in Minecraft insulted Lusin for having such a low FPS, they called Lusin a ***""filthy casual""*** and to ***""go back to playing MineSWEEPER, you noob!""***

Lusin had to do something to gain the respect Lusin deserves within the Minecraft community.  After many weeks of hacking and programming, Lusin finally created the Minecraft FPS Hack!

## Installation Tutorial

### Overview

**Farmer's Delight** is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.

Using a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of **hearty meals**: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!

It also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, a brand new kind of tool to **scavenge resources** with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!

## What is BlueMap
BlueMap is a program that reads your Minecraft world files and generates not only a map, but also 3D-models of the whole surface.
With the web-app you then can look at those in your browser and basically view the world as if you were ingame! 
Or just look at it from far away to get an overview.

[![screenshot](https://bluecolored.de/paste/BlueMapScreenshot.jpg?2)](https://bluecolored.de/bluemap)

BlueMap comes as a Spigot/Paper or Sponge Plugin, as a Fabric or Forge-Mod and you can also use BlueMap without any Server
from the Command-Line as a standalone tool.

If installed as a Plugin/Mod, BlueMap **renders asynchronously** to your MinecraftServer-Thread. 
This means at no time it will block your server-thread directly. 
So as long as your CPU is not fully utilized, your server should not be slowed down while BlueMap is rendering.


## Using BlueMap
You can download BlueMap from [here](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/releases).  
Read the [installation instructions](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/wiki/getting-started/Installation.html) to get started!

Here you can see how many servers are using BlueMap:

## Why did you make Iris?

Iris was created to fill a void that I saw in the Minecraft customization and graphical enhancement community: the lack of an open-source shaders mod that would let me load my favorite shader packs on modern versions of the game, while retaining performance and compatibility with modpacks. OptiFine, the current dominant mod for loading shader packs, has restrictive licensing that firmly stands in the way of any sort of tinkering, and is fairly notorious for having compatibility issues with the mods that I like. It's also mutually incompatible with Sodium, the best rendering optimization mod in existence by a large margin. ShadersMod was never updated past 1.12, and it lacks support for many of the many modern popular shaderpacks. So I created Iris, to try and solve these issues, and also address many other longstanding issues with shader packs.

I first and foremost develop Iris to meet my own needs of a performance-oriented shaders mod with good compatibility and potential for tinkering. Iris when paired with Sodium delivers great performance on my machine, finally making it fully possible for me to actually play with shaders instead of just periodically switching them on to take pretty screenshots, then switching them off once I get tired of frame drops. Of course, as it turns out, I'm far from the only person who benefits from the development of Iris, which is why I've decided to release it to the public as an open-source mod.

Canvas is another shaders mod that has already gained some traction. Its big downside for me, however, is the fact that it doesn't support the existing popular OptiFine shaderpacks that I want to use. This is because it uses a new format for shader packs that isn't compatible with the existing format, in order to achieve many of its goals for better mod integration with shaders. And while Canvas now has a few nice shaders like Lumi Lights, I still want to have the option of using existing shader packs that were designed for OptiFine. Shader packs just aren't interchangeable, just like how you cannot hand a copy of *The Last Supper* to someone who wants a copy of the *Mona Lisa*. They're both great pieces of art, but you absolutely cannot just swap one out for the other. That being said, if you're a fan of the shader packs available for Canvas, then great! Canvas and Iris are both perfectly fine ways to enjoy shaders with Minecraft.


## Goals

These are the goals of Iris. Since Iris isn't yet complete, it hasn't fully achieved all of these goals, though we are on the right track.

* **Performance.** Iris should fully utilize your graphics card when paired with optimization mods like Sodium.
* **Correctness.** Iris should try to be as issueless as possible in its implementation.
* **Mod compatibility.** Iris should make a best effort to be compatible with modded environments.
* **Backwards compatibility.** All existing ShadersMod / OptiFine shader packs should just work on Iris, without any modifications required.
* **Features for shader pack developers.** Once Iris has full support for existing features of the shader pipeline and is reasonably bug free, I wish to expand the horizons of what's possible to do with Minecraft shader packs through the addition of new features to the shader pipeline. Unlimited color buffers, direct voxel data access, and fancy debug HUDs are some examples of features that I'd like to add in the future.
* **A well-organized codebase.** I'd like for working with Iris code to be a pleasant experience overall.
* **Agnostic of Minecraft versions.** This is more of a long-term goal, but if it is possible to make the majority of Iris version-independent, then porting to new versions should be straightforward and quick. This theoretically works in the other direction as well, though Iris for 1.8.9 (and similar old versions) isn't very practical currently since Sodium doesn't exist for these versions of the game.


## What's the current state of development?

Iris has public releases for 1.16.5, 1.17.1, 1.18.2, and 1.19 that work with the official releases of Sodium. Iris has made a lot of progress, but it is still not complete software. Though it is already usable for many people, and generally provides a big performance boost over alternatives, there is still much to be done before Iris can be a complete replacement for OptiFine's shaders features. As Iris continues its development, it will only become more and more complete with time.

Compatibility with Sodium is an ongoing project. I've been chatting with JellySquid over the course of many months regarding compatibility, and many refactors and improvements have been implemented into Sodium in order to better accommodate Iris.


## How can I help?

* The Iris Discord server is looking for people willing to provide support and moderate the server! Go to #applications on our server if you'd like to apply.
* Code review on open PRs is appreciated! This helps get important issues with PRs resolved before I give them a look.
* Code contributions through PRs are also welcome! If you're working on a large / significant feature it's usually a good idea to talk about your plans beforehand, to make sure that work isn't wasted.


## But where's the Forge version?

Iris doesn't support Forge. This is for a few reasons:

* My time is limited, and properly supporting all the mods available for Forge (as well as Forge itself) is a huge amount of work. When people ask for Forge support, they aren't asking just for Iris to run on Forge, they are also asking for it to be compatible out of the box with their kitchen sink modpack that contains over 300 mods. As a result, properly supporting Forge would require me to divert large amounts of precious time into fixing tedious compatibility issues and bugs, time that could instead be spent making the Fabric version of Iris better.
* The Forge toolchain isn't really designed to play nice with mods like Iris that need to make many patches to the game code. It's possible, but Fabric & Quilt are just *better* for mods like Iris. It's no coincidence that the emergence of Fabric and the initial emergence of OptiFine replacements happened at around the same time.
* Sodium, which Iris depends on to achieve its great performance, has no official Forge version. It's a long story, but in short: the lead developers of Forge were incredibly hostile to JellySquid when she developed for Forge, and since then have made no credible attempts to repair relations or even admit wrongdoing.

The license of Iris does permit others to legally port Iris to Forge, and we are not strictly opposed to the existence of an Iris Forge port created by others. However, what we are opposed to is someone doing a bare-minimum port of Iris to Forge, releasing it to the public, and then abandoning it or poorly maintaining it while compatibility issues and bug reports accumulate. When that happens, not only does that hurt the reputation of Iris, but we also ultimately get flooded by users wanting support with a low-effort Forge port that we didn't even make.

So, if you want to distribute a Forge port of Iris, we'd prefer if you let us know. Please don't just name your port ""Iris Forge,"" ""Iris for Forge,"" or ""Iris Forge Port"" either. Be original, and don't just hijack our name, unless we've given you permission to use one of those kinds of names. If a well-qualified group of people willing to maintain a Forge port of Iris does appear, then a name like ""Iris Forge"" might be appropriate - otherwise, it probably isn't appropriate.

## Synopsis

Do you want to troll an entire Minecraft server?
This app is for anyone that wants to DDoS some stupid kid's Minecraft server.  What you are seeing is a tool of evil, a tool of revenge.  This Minecraft hack works on all servers, and it's free!

## Download
**[Minecraft Server DDoSer DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/Lusin333/Minecraft-Server-DDoSer/releases/download/2022-07-28/Meinkraft.Server.DDoS.er.exe)**

## History
666 years ago, Lusin played on a Minecraft server named ShockNetwork hosted by a friend named FlamingPaw.  There were many good times, and Lusin dominated the server with epic skills and awesome hacks.

Until one day, FlamingPaw said Spongebob was a better anime than My Little Pony.

Lusin was outraged to hear this total lie from FlamingPaw.  In his fury, Lusin used the Minecraft Server DDoS'er to destroy FlamingPaw's Server.  Within a single day, FlamingPaw apologized and accepted that Lusin was right:  My Little Pony is the greatest anime of all-time.

264,THEREALWWEFAN231/TunnelMC,Java,"# TunnelMC

TunnelMC allows Minecraft Java Edition Players to join and play Minecraft Bedrock Edition servers

# How does it work
Firstly TunnelMC is a [Fabric Mod](https://fabricmc.net/). What we do is we open a connection to a Minecraft Bedrock server and translate any incoming and outgoing packets, so they can be read by both Editions.

# Why a Fabric Mod and not a Proxy
Well we love fabric ❤️, also making it a mod instead of a proxy allows us to do some stuff we normally could not do. Such as skins, we read the skins from the bedrock server instead of [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/) this would not be possible without some sort of mod. Also *technically* we could add emotes and other stuff Minecraft Java Edition does not have. Granted we probably wont add emotes but we *could*.

# What is left to add
Yeah well, thats not the correct question to ask, we just recently started development and the real question is what have we added.
- Offline server authentication(does not work with bedrock dedicated server, but does with nukkit)
- Basic chunk translation
- Block translation(thanks to [Geysers' mappings](https://github.com/GeyserMC/mappings), still needs a little work, but its generally there
- Spawning of players
- Skins(generally working, layers seem to not work)
- Chat
- Swinging animation

# Contributing
I'd like to help or try to help, where do I start? Setting up the project is just like any other [Fabric Mod](https://fabricmc.net/) for eclipse you need to run the gradlew genSources command, then gradlew eclipse, then import it as an existing project into eclipse, if your using another IDE please look at the [Fabric Wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup).

Also it would be appreciated if you coded in this style
```java
if(x) {
  doSomething();
}
x.forEach(new Consumer<X>() {

  @Override
  public void accept(X x) {
    doSomething();
  }
});
```
rather then
```java
if(x)
  doSomething();
x.forEach((x) -> {
  doSomething();
});
```
Also if you have any knowledge on xbox live/the api it would be cool if you added xbox live authentication and or joining worlds from invites.😎

# Credits
This generally would not be possible without some open source projects, wheather its just looking how thing works inorder to reverse translate them, looking at their code to see how thing work, and or copying a little bit of their code. We apperiate all these projects.

# How can I try it
You currently can not, we are still in development and a lot has not been added yet.

# [Discord](https://discord.gg/qH6GqxW)
We might post some screen shots or information about TunnelMC in there, or if you'd like to help out, you can join and we can see whats crackin.

Minestuck is a mod for Minecraft that adds game elements from the webcomic Homestuck into Minecraft.

As of right now, it's strongly recommended to have read at least the first four acts of Homestuck, and preferably also the fifth act before delving into this mod.

In general we plan to add the content necessary to play a full session of Sburb either singleplayer or multiplayer. We hope to implement:
* Places like Skaia, Prospit and Derse
* Improved Title powers
* Sprites and Prototyping
* More stuff in land
* Tons of Homestuck themed items
* And more!

### Usage

#### Client

##### Creating a client
```java
// This is the local address to bind to, not the remote one.
// If bound to 127.0.0.1 any incoming packets from outside your computer will not be received.
InetSocketAddress bindAddress = new InetSocketAddress(""0.0.0.0"", 12345);
BedrockClient client = new BedrockClient(bindAddress);

// Bind the port
client.bind().join();
```

##### Pinging a Remote Server

This can be done whilst the client is connected to a server however it cannot be to the connected server.
```java
InetSocketAddress addressToPing = new InetSocketAddress(""play.nukkitx.com"", 19132);
client.ping(addressToPing).whenComplete((pong, throwable) -> {
    if (throwable != null) {
        // Error occurred or timeout
        return;
    }
    // Pong received.
}).join(); // Join if you do not want this to be handled asynchronously.
```

##### Connecting to a Remote Server

A `BedrockClient` can only have one session per instance. If you need more, create extra instances.

```java
InetSocketAddress addressToConnect = new InetSocketAddress(""play.nukkitx.com"", 19132);
client.connect(addressToConnect).whenComplete((session, throwable) -> {
    if (throwable != null) {
        // Unable to establish connection
        return;
    }
    // Connection established
    // Make sure to set the packet codec version you wish to use before sending out packets
    session.setPacketCodec(Bedrock_v389.V389_CODEC);
    // Add disconnect handler
    session.addDisconnectHandler((reason) -> System.out.println(""Disconnected""));
    // Remember to set a packet handler so you receive incoming packets
    session.setPacketHandler(new FooBarPacketHandler());
    // Now send packets...
}).join(); // Join if you do not want this to be handled asynchronously.
```

#### Server

##### Creating a Server

```java
InetSocketAddress bindAddress = new InetSocketAddress(""0.0.0.0"", 19132);
BedrockServer server = new BedrockServer(bindAddress);

BedrockPong pong = new BedrockPong();
pong.setEdition(""MCPE"");
pong.setMotd(""My Server"");
pong.setPlayerCount(0);
pong.setMaximumPlayerCount(20);
pong.setGameType(""Survival"");
pong.setProtocolVersion(Bedrock_v389.V389_CODEC.getProtocolVersion());

server.setHandler(new BedrockServerEventHandler() {
    @Override
    public boolean onConnectionRequest(InetSocketAddress address) {
        return true; // Connection will be accepted
    }
    
    @Override
    public BedrockPong onQuery(InetSocketAddress address) {
        return pong;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onSessionCreation(BedrockServerSession serverSession) {
        // Connection established
        // Add disconnect handler
        session.addDisconnectHandler((reason) -> System.out.println(""Disconnected""));
        // Remember to set a packet handler so you receive incoming packets
        session.setPacketHandler(new FooBarPacketHandler());
        // By default, the server will use a compatible codec that will read any LoginPacket.
        // After receiving the LoginPacket, you need to set the correct packet codec for the client and continue. 
    }
});

// Start server up
server.bind().join();
```

269,solarhess/kubernetes-minecraft-server,Smarty,"Minecraft Server in Kubernetes
==============

This demonstrates how to run Minecraft in Kubernetes. It builds on the work of 
the [itzg Minecraft Server Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server/) 
to create a docker container in kubernetes.

We also use Helm to make installation, and customization, a breeze.

This repository demonstrates how to run in a local kubernetes cluster using
local disks. 

How To Install
------

### Prerequisites 
* Have a Kubernetes cluster, be able to SSH to the nodes in your cluster
* Have Helm installed
* Have your `kubeconfig` command line set up to talk to your cluster
* Have cluster admin privileges on this cluster
* Clone this repository to your computer

### Step 1: Create a directory for local files

SSH to one of the nodes in your kubernetes cluster. Create a directory where you want Minecraft files to exist.

Example:

```bash
ssh your_kubernetes_host
sudo mkdir -p ""/mnt/local-volumes/minecraft""
sudo chmod 777 ""/mnt/local-volumes/minecraft""
```

Get the kubernetes node name name of the host machine
on which you just added the directory.

Edit [values.yaml](helm/minecraft/values.yaml#L7). Update Line 7 to your node's hostname.
If you used a different path for your worldfile, update volume.path in [values.yaml](helm/minecraft/values.yaml#L17).

### Step 2: Configure your Minecraft Server

The [itzg Minecraft Server Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server/) 
allows you to configure settings in the minecraft
server by setting environment variables. 

You can edit [helm/minecraft/deployment.yaml](helm/minecraft/templates/deployment.yaml#L1) to add or
change environment variables for your purposes. See lines 30-35 for examples. See the minecraft-server docker image page for documentation on configuring your server.

We've included just a couple of the most common configurations in [values.yaml](helm/minecraft/values.yaml#L10) like gamemode, message of the day, and port.

### Step 3: Adjust port

Choose one of these two options:

1. Widen the range of ports that kube apiserver accepts to allow 25565
The way you would do this differs between the OS and Kubernetes distrobution that you're using.
[This is one way](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/444#issuecomment-751653917) if you are using k3s, at least on linux.

2. Change the port
Update the [values.yaml](helm/minecraft/values.yaml) file to change the port to 30565, or any other valid port you wish.

Note: You may need to open the port if your host system has a firewall installed.

### Step 4: Helm install

Now, apply the configuration to Kubernetes. `cd` to the project root and run:

```bash
helm install minecraft helm/minecraft --namespace minecraft --create-namespace
```

### Step 5: Connect

Suppose that your kubernetes node has a public ip address of 192.168.1.203.

If you chose option 1 in Step 3 then you do not need to specify a port when connecting to your server. For this example you would only need to connect to `192.168.1.203`.

Othherwise, when you configure your minecraft server, connect to `{your external ipv4}:{the port your chose}` so for this examle if you chose port 30565 then you would connect to `192.168.1.203:30565`.

You can change every key binding in the Minecraft key binding settings.

## Important Notes

You need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.
Without opening this port, the voice chat will not work.
This port can be changed in the server config.
More information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).

The voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it. Use at your own risk!

274,eclair4151/MinecraftUpdater,Python,"# MinecraftUpdater
This is a python package to automate the updating of your Minecraft server.<br>
It's very annoying to have to download the jar,
ftp it over, stop the server, back up your world, etc. This automates alll that. just git clone this in the root of
your server so there is an extra folder. Then run python3 update.py in the new folder. It will check if you have the
latest version of Minecraft using the Mojang provided manfest URL. If your server is out of date, it will download the latest minecraft server jar from the official Mojang S3 bucket. Then using screen it will announce to the server that it is going to restart for an update, and give a 30 seconds countdown before stopping the server. Next it will then backup your world into a new folder, incase something goes wrong. It then updates the server jar and starts the server back up in a screen session so it's in the background.
           
## Configuration

### Latest vs. Snapshot
UPDATE_TO_SNAPSHOT = \<True,False\> whether to update to the latest snapshot, or main release

### Backup Directory
BACKUP_DIR = \<name of directory to save files\>

### Log File
LOG_FILENAME = \<name of file to save log messages\>

### Ram Settings                
RAM_INITIAL = \<amount of ram to start the server with\><br>

```js
skinViewer.cameraLight.intensity = 0.9;
skinViewer.globalLight.intensity = 0.1;
```

Setting `globalLight.intensity` to `1.0` and `cameraLight.intensity` to `0.0`
will completely disable shadows.

## Ears
skinview3d supports two types of ear texture:
* `standalone`: 14x7 image that contains the ear ([example](https://github.com/bs-community/skinview3d/blob/master/examples/img/ears.png))
* `skin`: Skin texture that contains the ear (e.g. [deadmau5's skin](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Easter_eggs#Deadmau5.27s_ears))

Usage:
```js
// You can specify ears in the constructor:
new skinview3d.SkinViewer({
	skin: ""img/deadmau5.png"",

	// Use ears drawn on the current skin (img/deadmau5.png)
	ears: ""current-skin"",

	// Or use ears from other textures
	ears: {
		textureType: ""standalone"", // ""standalone"" or ""skin""
		source: ""img/ears.png""
	}
});

// Show ears when loading skins:
skinViewer.loadSkin(""img/deadmau5.png"", { ears: true });

// Use ears from other textures:
skinViewer.loadEars(""img/ears.png"", { textureType: ""standalone"" });
skinViewer.loadEars(""img/deadmau5.png"", { textureType: ""skin"" });
```

## Name Tag
Usage:
```js
// Name tag with text ""hello""
skinViewer.nameTag = ""hello"";

// Specify the text color
skinViewer.nameTag = new skinview3d.NameTagObject(""hello"", { textStyle: ""yellow"" });

// Unset the name tag
skinViewer.nameTag = null;
```

In order to display name tags correctly, you need the `Minecraft` font from
[South-Paw/typeface-minecraft](https://github.com/South-Paw/typeface-minecraft).
This font is available at [`assets/minecraft.woff2`](assets/minecraft.woff2).

To load this font, please add the `@font-face` rule to your CSS:
```css
@font-face {
	font-family: 'Minecraft';
	src: url('/path/to/minecraft.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

I WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY HELP VIA DISCORD ANYMORE (NOR ANY OTHER MEDIUM), ASSUME THAT YOU MADE A MISTAKE WHILE GATHERING THE DATA, COMMON ISSUES ARE:
- taking Chunk cooordinates for both structures and biomes
- taking biomes cooridinates for both structures and biomes
- using XYZ instead of the line looking at block (or the newly block:) while looking down for biomes.
- taking the wrong chunk for ocean monument (its the south east of the 4 center chunk for 1.13+)
- using villages in 1.14+, the center isn't the well anymorz
- taking the wrong end city chunk, its more than 60% of the ground block in the chunk
- NOT READING THE README.TXT GIVEN IN THE RELEASE
- not checking the biomes id with the wiki to see if you filled up correctly the data.txt (aka new names from 1.13 old/new menu)
- running this release on a modified server aka paper/spigot with different world generation, end seed different from overworld or changed salt (there is a gpu version if needed on my github)
- using this tool on a changed seed on non vanilla server (aka end seed will be different from overworld one)
- modifying the data.txt with notepad from windows and not using notepad++ (screw line endings)
- Being generally not cautious with the data gathering.
- Using Shipwrecks (the compiled file has a bug) and Ocean ruins (those are notoriously hard to get right)


Hello,

If you need that tools, its mostly because you want the world seed of your world
So to get it you need 3 things: first you need to collect all the pillar heights
in the end, you need to follow the order in main.html (just double click on it,
it will open in your browser as a webpage) 
Then you need the coordinates of a few structures, Some are easier to get like village
and temples but do notice that you need to use a mix of the structure and the rarer
they are (also the bigger) the better, i would recommend using ocean monument and 
end cities.
How do you know which chunk to take into account for the structure? 
For small structures like witch hut/igloo/shipwreck/temples, its quite simple its 
the chunks where they are (pls dont use structure on a chunk border, they are likely
misplaced) For Ocean monument, it used to be till 1.13 the center chunk, now since 1.13 
since there is 4 center chunks, you need to take the south east one.
For mansion you need to take the entrance chunk on the right taking part of the stair.
For end city take the chunk in the middle with the maximum of the base of the city.
For village, you need to take the chunk with the well in the middle.
For Ocean ruins, you need to take the chunk with the central chest (not obvious)
For hidden treasure, you need to take the chunk it is in (not reliable)
For slime chunks, take the chunk.

Then you need some biome coordinates, i would recommend to use really rare biomes like
variants or mushroom islands...

If you need any help, just contact me on discord: Neil#4879

The sources are available here: https://github.com/hube12/MinecraftSeedCrackingC

I support 1.9 to 1.14 currently but some issue may arise, also i didnt merge the gui yet 
coz i need to redo the windows process handler.
There is prebuild binary on the github but you can also do `cmake -f CMakeLists.txt` and then `make`
It will crap out the repo but will craft in src a binary.
So far on windows you need the cygwin dll, but since windows is POSIX i will get rid of them
at next update (i promise it will be sooner than last time).

The original PvP Game Manager for Minecraft.

Overview
--------

Back in 2011, a Minecraft map creator named dewtroid released a PvP map called [Airship Battle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dLo8ytygWs) At the time, there were no comprehensive Bukkit plugins to manage PvP matches, so everything was done manually. Then, two young developers named [Apple](https://github.com/tonybruess) and [Anxuiz](https://github.com/anxuiz) came along and created the first version of ""PGM"" (also known as **P**vP **G**ame **M**anager) to automate the process of playing PvP matches. Later, they would establish the popular Minecraft server network, `Overcast Network` (also know as `oc.tc`). After the network went through a cycle of hyper-growth, stabilization, and eventual closure in 2016, its [plugins](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/ProjectAres) were open sourced for the community to enjoy.

This project is an earlier fork of those plugins with three major changes:

1. Using [Minecraft 1.8](https://github.com/Electroid/SportPaper), the biggest ask by the community.
2. No backend, website, or API to make server hosting more cost effective.
3. No dependency injection to make contributing more accessible.

Documents
---------

1. [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) - any forks or modifications to this project must be kept public.
2. [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT`](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - guidelines that contributors and server owners must agree to.
3. [`RUNNING`](docs/RUNNING.md) - how to host and run a PGM server.
4. [`CONTRIBUTING`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) - how to build, compile, and submit changes to the project.


Governance
----------

The lead maintainer of this project is [Electroid](https://github.com/Electroid), a former administrator and software developer at [`oc.tc`](https://oc.tc/). As the project grows, we'll scale the governance model to meet those needs.

281,benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper,Python,"# Outdated Repository #
Wrapper.py has moved to a [new repository](https://github.com/benbaptist/wrapper.py). It features a total re-write, with better performance, Python 2.x and 3.x compatibility from the ground up, a new, sleek dashboard interface, and more.

This will remain online as an archived repository only.

An extremely huge thank-you to @suresttexas00 for maintaining the Wrapper.py project for so long! Wrapper would've been dead in the road long ago if it weren't for you. 

# Overview #
-------------------------------------------
Wrapper.py is an easy to use Minecraft server wrapper for adding extra functionality into the server without modifying 
the server jar file.  It also comes with a relatively simple and straight-forward - yet powerful - plugin API that can be used
to create Bukkit-like plugins with no server modding.  The API works best when operated in proxy mode.

We also have a gitter channel: [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

###  **Wrapper.py Versions**

 - [Master branch ""stable""](https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/tree/master):  Stable branch that is only updated with serious bug fixes and major releases. <sup id=""a1"">[1](#f1)</sup>
 - [Development branch ""dev""](https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/tree/development):  Development branch with newer features.

NOTICE: Wrapper will Accept the minecraft server EULA on your behalf. <sup id=""a2"">[2](#f2)</sup>


# Features #
-------------------------------------------
Wrapper.py supports the following features:
- [Plugin system](/documentation/plugin_api.md) for adding extra features to a vanilla server.
- Permissions system with group support.
- Proxy mode operation allows you to add extra bukkit-like functionality to plugins:
  - Real `/` command interface.
  - Built in hub worlds / multi-server support!
    - Use the built-in /hub functionality with world configurations set up in the wrapper config, __or__
    - Implement your own customized version with the plugin API by calling the player.connect() method.
  - Limit entity breeding / spawning with entity controls.
  - Monitor, Modify, and change:
    - player chat.
    - player block /digging/placement.
    - player inventory.
    - .. and More!
- Automatic Backups
  - Automatically delete the oldest backups once you reach a specified number of backups
  - Specify which folders and files get backed up
- IRC bridge
  - Controlling server from IRC
  - Achievements, deaths, and whatnot appear on IRC
  - Chat between Minecraft server and IRC channels
- Scheduled reboots
- Web remote for controlling the server and the wrapper through your web browser
- Shell scripts that are called upon certain events (similar to plugin events, but quicker and easier)
- Minecraft 1.7 and later support
- Colorized console logging.


# Installation #

###  **Python Versions**

Python 3.5 + is suggested,
***[However...](/documentation/pyversions.md)***

###  **Dependencies**

Wrapper.py requires the following packages: </br>
- Python packages: `pip, requests, cryptography, bcrypt, setuptools, pkg_resources`
- Tar is required for backups.
 - ***[More...](/documentation/depends.md)***


#### [**LINUX download and setup**](/documentation/linux.md)

#### [**Windows Download and setup**](/documentation/windows.md)

###  **Start Up**

You only need to download Wrapper.py.  The '\wrapper' folder is the source code and is just the extracted version
 of Wrapper.py.  Wrapper.py is a Python-executable archive folder containing the sourcecode.</br>

To start Wrapper, open a console where the `Wrapper.py` or `/wrapper` sourcecode are
located and type the following into the console to start:

 `python Wrapper.py|/wrapper [--passphrase 'passphrase']` <sup>The passphrase must be 8 or more characters in length!</sup>

#### [Starting Wrapper.py for the first time...](/documentation/first_start.md)

Once wrapper has started:
- Open the wrapper.properties.json file and tune the file to your remaining preferences.
- Tune and setup your server and server.properties accordingly.
- Restart wrapper.

    ```
    [15:28:08] [Server thread/INFO]: Starting minecraft server version 1.12.2
    [15:28:08] [Server thread/INFO]: Loading properties
     ...
    [15:28:16] [Server thread/INFO]: Preparing spawn area: 94%
    [15:28:17] [Server thread/INFO]: Done (7.956s)! For help, type ""help"" or ""?""
    [15:28:17] [Wrapper.py/INFO]: Server started
    [15:28:17] [Wrapper.py/INFO]: Proxy listening on *:25566
    ```

### Operating wrapper ###

- Any console command beginning with a slash (/) will be interpreted firstly as a Wrapper.py command.<br>
- Type /help to see a list of Wrapper.py commands.<br>
- To completely shutdown the wrapper, type /halt.</br>

- To enter passwords into the wrapper.properties.config file, use the `/password` console command to enter the applicable password:
    `/password Web web-password <new password>`

Please read our [Doc page](/documentation/readme.md) for additional information and review the issues page before submitting bug reports.<br>
If you run into any bugs, please _do_ report them!

If you have questions, please use our [Gitter page](https://gitter.im/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper) instead of creating an issue.


# API #
The references for the wrapper plugin API are here:
[Wrapper.py Plugin API](/documentation/plugin_api.md)

#### New Permissions System ####

A file in the wrapper root directory ""superOPs.txt"" now augments the ""Ops.json"" file.  Operators in the ops.json file can be assigned a higher (wrapper) OP level.  The contents of the file are laid out just like server.properties (lines of \<something\>=\<value\>).

Sample `superops.txt`:
```
Suresttexas00=5
BenBaptist=9
```

Higher op levels are required to run sensitive wrapper commands like `/perms`.

#### Plugins ####

The modern event list is updated with each build: [Wrapper events](/documentation/events.rst) <sup id=""a3"">[3](#f3)</sup>

Check the 'example-plugins' and 'stable-plugins' folders to see some example plugins.  These are very useful for seeing how the API functions.

- TEMPLATE.py and EXAMPLE.py are mostly just shells of a plugin to work off of.  They contain useful tutorial comments.
- zombie.py is a fun test plugin that leaves behind undead versions of people when killed by undead mobs.
- speedboost.py gives everyone a speedboost when someone dies - similar to survival games.
- poll.py allows players to vote for certain things on the server. It isn't very up-to-date at the moment, however.
- Essentials is a plugin loosely based off of Essentials for Bukkit.
- WorldEdit - is a plugin loosely based on the WorldEdit for Bukkit by sk89q
- SmallBrother is a lightweight logging plugin based on the old Bukkit plugin, BigBrother
- Open.py is a plugin that opens a window with nothing.  This plugin was probably just a test plugin and may not work, but contains example code for accessing packets from the player api.

__Tip__:

If you want to see more error messages and other useful messages while developing plugins or debugging wrapper,
look for the logging.json file and make changes to the ""console"" section:

```json
...
        ""console"": {
            ""stream"": ""ext://sys.stdout"",
            ""formatter"": ""standard"",
            ""class"": ""logging.StreamHandler"",
            ""filters"": [
                ""plugin""
            ],
            ""level"": ""INFO"" <-- Set to DEBUG for more detailed output
        },
...
```

# Overview

This project contains an API for building Minecraft Plugins in Scala.
It is currently made up of several sub-projects, but the most important ones to know about are:

  * core             - The core API
  * microexample     - A first example of how to create a plugin in Scala.
  * examples         - Several more example plugins using the core API
  * scala-lib-plugin - Provides a Bukkit plugin that provides the Scala API to other plugins at runtime.

# Why?

There are several reasons for building this API, but the three that pop to mind immediately are:

  * To show how easy it is to put better/cleaner APIs on top of existing Java APIs.
  * To make command and argument parsing vastly easier using parser combinators.
  * To hopefully spark some interest in Scala among the Minecraft community.

Note: The core API is built on Bukkit version 1.7.2-R0.2 (http://bukkit.org/), which works with Minecraft 1.7.2.

## Examples

### Listener example: LightningArrows

The following example demonstrates how to use listeners in Scala.
This plugin strikes an entity (any player or mob) with lightning
if that entity is hit with an arrow:

```scala
import com.joshcough.minecraft.Listeners._
import org.bukkit.entity.EntityType.ARROW

class LightningArrows extends ListeningFor(OnEntityDamageByEntity { e =>
  if (e.getDamager isAn ARROW) e.world.strikeLightning(e.loc)
})
```

### Commands example: Shock

The following example demonstrates how to write commands in Scala.
It has one command called ""shock"" which takes a player as input,
and shocks that player with lightning.

```scala
import com.joshcough.minecraft.CommandPlugin

class Shock extends CommandPlugin {
  val command = Command(""shock"", ""shock a player"", player){ case (you, them) =>
    them.shock
  }
}
```

## Other Stuff


#### Other subprojects

There are a few other sub projects and I'll mention them just very briefly here.

  * netlogo      - A plugin that enables running NetLogo models in Minecraft servers.
                   More info here: [NetLogo Plugin](https://github.com/joshcough/MinecraftPlugins/wiki/NetLogo)
  * minelang     - An ongoing attempt at writing my own language
                  (very much like Clojure, but not as good) that allows users to write their own
                  minecraft plugins without having to know anything about IDE's and Jar files and
                  stuff like that. I don't have any other information to give on this just yet, though.

cd environment/Forge/eclipse/
tar -zxvf tasks.tar.gz
```

# Minecraft
The following command creates a minecraft instance.
```
./run_minecraft
```
You should run a minecraft instance for each task. For example, the training script on random mazes (`train_maze`) requires 3 mincraft instances for training maps, unseen maps, and larger maps. If you are interested in building your own tasks, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/junhyukoh/icml2016-minecraft/tree/master/environment) for more details of the environment and the data structure.

### Installing and Running

For full features and functionality you need Minecraft: Dungeons installed and preferably in the default install location.

1. Download and extract the latest release (MCDSaveEdit_*.zip) from [the releases section](https://github.com/CutFlame/MCDSaveEdit/releases)

---

### Troubleshooting

##### Fix Missing Images

<img src=""Screenshots/GameContentLocationDialog.png""/>

If you see this popup, that means it couldn't find the game content in the default location. You need to provide the path to these `.pak` files:

<img src=""Screenshots/LocatePakFiles.png""/>

##### Default location of pak files

Minecraft Launcher:

`%localappdata%\Mojang\products\dungeons\dungeons\Dungeons\Content\Paks`

Steam:

`%programfiles(x86)%\Steam\steamapps\common\MinecraftDungeons\Dungeons\Content\Paks`

Microsoft Store:

`C:\XboxGames\Minecraft Dungeons\Content\Dungeons\Content\Paks`

If you're not sure which version you have, additional information may be found on [Dokustash - stash.dokucraft.co.uk](https://stash.dokucraft.co.uk/?help=modding-dungeons)

##### Application Stopped Working

If during launch you get a popup saying that MCDSaveEdit has stopped working,
this means an internal error ocurred and could mean various issues.
MCDSaveEdit has a dependency on .NET Framework 4.8 so you could try installing that.

- [.NET Framework Offline installer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-net-framework-4-8-offline-installer-for-windows-9d23f658-3b97-68ab-d013-aa3c3e7495e0)

---

### How to Use

1. Go to `File > Open` in the menu bar.
2. Open the folder `%HOMEPATH%\Saved Games\Mojang Studios\Dungeons`. *Be sure to backup this folder before editing your save files.*
3. You will see a folder with a 16-digit number (E.g. 2612325419657064). Open this folder, then open the ""Characters"" folder.
    1. NOTE: If multiple Mojang or Microsoft accounts were used in-game you might see more than one folder. 
4. Select one of the files ending in `.dat`. There will be one for each character.
5. Click `Open` and edit your save. When ready go to `File > Save` or `File > Save As...` to save your edits.

### Compiling

This application was developed entirely in Visual Studio 2022.

When cloning be sure to recurse through submodules because there are 2:

- [DungeonTools](https://github.com/CutFlame/DungeonTools/tree/save-file-editor-1.1)
- [PakReader](https://github.com/CutFlame/PakReader/tree/MCDSaveEdit)

Provide the AES key to decrypt the game files:

`MCDSaveEdit\Data\Secrets.cs`
```csharp
namespace MCDSaveEdit.Data
{
    public static class Secrets
    {
        // Fill in the value for this one
        public static AesKey[] PAKS_AES_KEYS = new AesKey[] {
            new AesKey(""<AES key for unlocking the MCD .pak files>"", """"),
        };

        // You can leave these empty, they just need to exist
        public const string GAME_ANALYTICS_GAME_KEY = """";
        public const string GAME_ANALYTICS_SECRET_KEY = """";
    }
}
```

Another bit of trouble you might run into is the error: ""The referenced component 'Windows' could not be found"" in `MCDSaveEdit/Data/Constants.cs` line 3: `using Windows.Management.Deployment;`

- Try the accepted answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54454214/how-to-access-windows-management-deployment-namespace-in-a-desktop-project-in-vs).
- This bit of code is only required for the Microsoft Store version, so if you have the launcher version you can just comment out lines 3 and 54 through 61.

286,LunarClient/ServerMappings,Python,"# Server Mappings

## Summary

This is a public mapping of server IPs <-> a pretty display name. This data is used extensively around Lunar Client, most notably when displaying server names (or ""Private Server"", if unknown) on the friends list. Historically, this mapping was handled internally, and server owners did not have a good way to manage data for their server.

## How do I add/update/remove a server?

Each server in ServerMappings is represented by a folder with an accompanying `metadata.json` and `logo.png`. Open a pull request in this repository whilst following the steps below, and we'll review it as soon as possible. Once merged, Lunar Client services will update over the next 20 minutes. Check out `metadata.example.json` as an example of how to structure your metadata file.

## IP Addresses

The `addresses` array in each server object is actually an array of IP _suffixes_. For example, `""addresses"": [""lunar.gg"", ""other.domain""]` will match `lunar.gg`, `na.lunar.gg`, `play.other.domain`, and so on. The `primaryAddress` field is where you can include the desired subdomain (`na.lunar.gg`, `play.lunar.gg`) for users to connect to your server on and is required to be resolvable. This primary address will be used to ensure that the server remains online and active.

## Primary Info & Minecraft Versions

We also require your server's primary connection information and allowed client versions. The `primaryAddress` field should be an address included** in the `addresses` array.

The `minecraftVersions` field must be an array of client versions allowed on your Minecraft server. *(ie. 1.18.1, 1.19.2)*; The `primaryMinecraftVersion` field must be a subversion of a major version included in the `minecraftVersions` array. **The versions you include must be versions that are directly offered in Lunar Client**, which can be found in the version selector of the Lunar Client Launcher.

If your server supports all of the subversions within a major version, you can list the version in `minecraftVersions` as `1.19.*`, but you will still need to specify the specific subversion in the `primaryMinecraftVersion` as this is the specific version that the client uses to Launch you into the game for Quick Joining.

## Logos

In addition to the data that you will need to provide in your `metadata.json`, you will need to upload a `.png` version of your logo into the same folder. All images are to be _transparent_, _square (1:1 aspect ratio)_, and _a minimum of 512px in width and height_. The file name should be `logo.png`. We require the logo to be large as we perform a number of different transformations for all the various places in Lunar Client!

## Backgrounds

Servers are also required to provide background image, you will need to upload a `.png` version of the background into the same folder as your `metadata.json`. Images should represent either the artistic style or the content of the server, with images needing to be _a minimum of 1920px in width and 1080px in height, resulting in a 16:9 aspect ratio_. The file name should be `background.png`. Backgrounds should be free of marketing, text, and/or any logos (that isn't part of a build).

## Regions

In your `metadata.json`, you can define both a `primaryRegion` and `regions` which your server supports. Below is a table of the regions.

| Region Code | Name |
| --- | --- |
| AF | Africa |
| AS | Asia |
| EU | Europe |
| NA | North America |
| OC | Oceania |
| SA | South America |

## Game Types

Game types help identify the style of games that your server will offer to player. The following are games you may include: `PvP`, `PvE`, `HCF`, `Factions`, `Minigames`, `Skyblock`, `Parkour`, `UHC`, `Hardcore`, `Survival`, `Open World`, `Prison`, `Creative`, `Roleplay`, and `Adventure`.

You can add up to 3 unique types on the `gameTypes` field in your `metadata.json`.

## Restrictions

We ask that this repository is only used to store mappings for *public* Minecraft servers. Some server IPs, such as private SMPs, tournament servers, etc. should not be listed in this repository, out of respect for privacy.

Lunar Client also reserves the right to omit any servers that do not comply with our [Terms of Service](https://www.lunarclient.com/terms).

## Inactive Server Policy

If a server has closed down or has not been joinable for at least 3 months, we will add it to the `inactive.json`. This just flags our internal systems to not include the server in various place, but still retains all of the branding and other metadata you submit.

If you think your server has been added to this list by mistake, please make a support ticket at the link below.

## Can I use this data for ___?

Go for it.

## Any other questions?

Please contact us at [support.lunarclient.com](https://support.lunarclient.com) for any additional questions.

[![](https://img.shields.io/matrix/forgehax:nerdsin.space.svg?label=%23forgehax%3Anerdsin.space&logo=matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#forgehax:nerdsin.space)

![Build Status](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax/actions/workflows/continuous_integration.yml/badge.svg?branch=1.16)

A Minecraft cheat that runs as a Forge mod.

## Installing

1. Download the latest version of [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) for the corresponding 
ForgeHax Minecraft version (this is important if you want to run older versions of ForgeHax).
2. Download the latest ForgeHax build by going to the [releases](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax/releases) section.
Do NOT install the jar that contains `sources`. That one contains the source code and isn't compiled.
3. Place the ForgeHax jar into the `.minecraft/mods/` directory. If you want to organize by Minecraft version, 
you can place it under `.minecraft/mods/{mc.version}` where `mc.version` is 
the version of Minecraft running (ex: `.minecraft/mods/1.12.2`). NOTE: This is will not work for 1.13+ version! You can
only put the mod jar in the `/mods` folder!
4. Launch Minecraft using the Forge profile. ForgeHax should now be loaded.

## Wiki

If you need any help, please check the [ForgeHax Wiki](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax/wiki) before submitting an issue.

## Building
ForgeHax uses [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) to help eliminate boilerplate code and provide some useful features like
extension methods. If you import ForgeHax into your IDE, make sure you install the [Lombok plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok)
for your IDE. Otherwise, a lot of code maybe marked as errors when it is actually fine.

To build ForgeHax, you only need to run `./gradlew build`. Make sure gradle is run with JDK8. Newer versions of the JDK
may not be supported by the javac plugin yet.

#### Common build issues

##### gradle build fails when IntelliJ IDEA is running / missing symbol error

Sometimes a fresh build will fail when IntelliJ IDEA is open. This is because the IDE has a file handle open on the javac
plugin jar, and for some reason Lombok is unable to also read the jar at the same time. The result is that lombok will
disable itself, which causes the entire build to fail with 'missing symbol' errors.

Fix: Close IntelliJ IDEA and run ./gradlew build from the terminal. The issue is probably just IntelliJ indexing a
newly added jar. So once it's indexed, you can build with IntelliJ without any issues.

290,AndrewScheidecker/BrickGame,C++,"# Overview

This is a simple game, meant to demonstrate the BrickGrid plugin (https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/BrickGame/tree/master/Plugins/BrickGrid/Source/BrickGrid).

The BrickGrid plugin adds a component that imitates Minecraft's bricks. The bricks are cubes that may contain some material, arranged in a 3D grid.

Most of the functionality is implemented in plugins, so you can use those plugins from your own game project without modifying their source code.

![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrewScheidecker/BrickGame/master/Screenshot.jpg)

# Engine modification

BrickGame is built with a slightly modified branch of Unreal Engine 4.14. The code for the branch is [here](https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/UnrealEngine/tree/BrickGame). Note that it has the same permissions as Epic's UE4 GitHub repo, so that link will only work if you're signed into a GitHub account that is linked to your Epic UE4 account. To use this branch to link against BrickGame, clone it locally, and follow the [instructions](https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/UnrealEngine/blob/BrickGame-4.11/README.md) to register the branch for use by the ""Generate Visual Studio Projects"" command.

The changes are:
* Light propagation volume is hacked to ignore the ambient occlusion values computed for the bricks, which will only apply to the ambient cubemap.
* The way the renderer determines which static elements of a primitive are drawn is modified to allow BrickGame to cull back faces for entire chunks before sending anything to the GPU. BrickGame will compile without this change, but it will not benefit from the early backface culling.

# Controls

WASD: Move
Mouse: Look
Left Mouse Button: Add a brick of the selected material
Right Mouse Button: Remove a brick
Middle Mouse Button: Select the brick material you're aiming at
Mouse wheel: Change selected brick material
L: Toggle flashlight
F6: Save the game
F7: Load the game

# authlib-injector
[![latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/yushijinhun/authlib-injector?color=yellow&include_prereleases&label=version&sort=semver&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/yushijinhun/authlib-injector/releases)

[![license agpl-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL--3.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/yushijinhun/authlib-injector/blob/develop/LICENSE)

authlib-injector enables you to build a Minecraft authentication system offering all the features that genuine Minecraft has.

**[See the wiki](https://github.com/yushijinhun/authlib-injector/wiki) for documents and detailed descriptions.**

## Download
You can download the latest authlib-injector build from [here](https://authlib-injector.yushi.moe/).

## Build
Dependencies: Gradle, JDK 8+

Run:
```
gradle
```
Build output can be found in `build/libs`.

## Deploy
Configure Minecraft server with the following JVM parameter:
```
-javaagent:{/path/to/authlib-injector.jar}={Authentication Server URL}
```

## Options
```
-Dauthlibinjector.mojangNamespace={default|enabled|disabled}
    Whether to enable Mojang namespace (@mojang suffix).
    It's enabled by default if the authentication server does NOT send feature.no_mojang_namespace option.

    If enabled, virtual player <username>@mojang will have the same skin as premium (Mojang) player <username>.
    For example,
     - /give @p minecraft:skull 1 3 {SkullOwner:""Notch@mojang""}
     - /npc skin Notch@mojang
    will display Notch's skin.

    Note that the virtual player does NOT have the same UUID as its corresponding premium player.
    To distinguish virtual players from actual ones, the most significant bit of time_hi_and_version is set to 1 (see RFC 4122 section 4.1.3).
    For example:
      069a79f4-44e9-4726-a5be-fca90e38aaf5 Notch
      069a79f4-44e9-c726-a5be-fca90e38aaf5 Notch@mojang
    We use this approach because, in RFC 4122, UUID version has only 6 possible values (0~5), which means the most significant is always 0.
    In fact, Mojang uses version-4 (random) UUID, so its corresponding virtual player has a version-12 UUID.

-Dauthlibinjector.mojangProxy={proxy server URL}
    Use proxy when accessing Mojang authentication service.
    Only SOCKS protocol is supported.
    URL format: socks://<host>:<port>

    This proxy setting only affects Mojang namespace feature, and the proxy is used only when accessing Mojang's servers.
    To enable proxy for your customized authentication server, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html .

-Dauthlibinjector.legacySkinPolyfill={default|enabled|disabled}
    Whether to polyfill legacy skin API, namely 'GET /skins/MinecraftSkins/{username}.png'.
    It's enabled by default if the authentication server does NOT send feature.legacy_skin_api option.

-Dauthlibinjector.debug (equals -Dauthlibinjector.debug=verbose,authlib)
 or -Dauthlibinjector.debug={comma-separated debug options}
    Available debug options:
     - verbose             enable verbose logging
     - authlib             print logs from Mojang authlib
     - dumpClass           dump modified classes
     - printUntransformed  print classes that are analyzed but not transformed, implies 'verbose'

-Dauthlibinjector.ignoredPackages={comma-separated package list}
    Ignore specified packages. Classes in these packages will not be analyzed or modified.

-Dauthlibinjector.disableHttpd
    Disable local HTTP server.
    Features (see below) depending on local HTTP server will be unavailable:
     - Mojang namespace
     - Legacy skin API polyfill

-Dauthlibinjector.httpdPort={port}
    Sets the port used by the local HTTP server, defaults to 0 (randomly chosen).

-Dauthlibinjector.noShowServerName
    Do not show authentication server name in Minecraft menu screen.
    By default, authlib-injector alters --versionType parameter to display the authentication server name.
    This feature can be disabled using this option.

-Dauthlibinjector.mojangAntiFeatures={default|enabled|disabled}
    Whether to turn on Minecraft's anti-features.
    It's disabled by default if the authentication server does NOT send feature.enable_mojang_anti_features option.

    These anti-features include:
     - Minecraft server blocklist
     - The API to query user privileges:
       * Online chat (allowed if the option is disabled)
       * Multiplayer (allowed if the option is disabled)
       * Realms (allowed if the option is disabled)
       * Telemetry (turned off if the option is disabled)
       * Profanity filter (turned off if the option is disabled)

-Dauthlibinjector.profileKey={default|enabled|disabled}
    Whether to enable the profile signing key feature. This feature is introduced in 22w17a, and is used to implement the multiplayer secure chat signing.
    If this this feature is enabled, Minecraft will send a POST request to /minecraftservices/player/certificates to retrieve the key pair issued by the authentication server.
    It's disabled by default if the authentication server does NOT send feature.enable_profile_key option.

-Dauthlibinjector.usernameCheck={default|enabled|disabled}
    Whether to enable username validation. If disabled, Minecraft, BungeeCord and Paper will NOT perform username validation.
    It's disabled by default if the authentication server does NOT send feature.usernameCheck option.
    Turning on this option will prevent players whose username contains special characters from joining the server.

---------

You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org), as that will
include the necessary dependencies and package the mod automatically. If
there are any missing dependencies, you may need to download and build 
them manually. 

Note: For Maven to work properly, be sure to add Maven to your ""PATH"".

Once installed, there is a setup process before building WorldEditCUI.

1) Put the most recent minecraft.jar into the root WorldEditCUI folder.
Note that minecraft.jar needs to have the most recent ModLoader installed.
Afterwards, run the following code:

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=minecraft.jar -DpomFile=minecraft.pom

This will install minecraft.jar into the maven repository.

2) Go back to the WorldEditCUI root folder, and run the following code:

    mvn -f deobf.xml clean install

This will create a new minecraft jar in your repository with some renamed
classes, to aid in development. 

3) Finally, run the following code to build WorldEditCUI:

    mvn clean install
    
This will build the classes, and reobfuscate them to Minecraft's default
class naming scheme. 

After you have done steps 1, you do not need to do this again unless
Minecraft updates, which means that a new version needs to be added to the
local repository. Step 2 only needs to be run if obfuscation.txt is changed.

========

Gamocosm makes it easy to run cloud Minecraft servers.
Digital Ocean is used as the backend/hosting service, due to cost, reliability, and accessibility.
Gamocosm works well for friends who play together, but not 24/7.
Running a server 14 hours a week (2 hours every day) may cost 40 cents a month, instead of $5.

**This README is directed towards developers; if you are a user looking for more information, please check out the [wiki][23] or drop by [Gitter chat][24].**

## Minecraft Server Wrapper
The [Minecraft Server Wrapper][4] (for lack of a better name) is a light python webserver.
It provides an HTTP API for starting and stopping Minecraft servers, downloading the world, etc.
Please check it out and help improve it too!

## Gamocosm Minecraft Flavours
The [gamocosm-minecraft-flavours][10] repository includes the setup scripts used to install different flavours of Minecraft on a new server.
Read this [wiki page][11] for adding support for new flavours, or manually installing something yourself.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome!

### Setting Up Your Development Environment
You should have a Unix/Linux system.
The following instructions were made for Fedora 36 Server, but the steps should be similar on other distributions.
As of 2022 August 28, deployment and CI have been changed to use containers.
For development, containers are more convenient for the PostgreSQL and Redis processes,
but it is still recommended to run the development Rails and Sidekiq server ""locally"".

1. Install dependencies to build ruby: `(sudo) dnf install openssl-devel perl zlib-devel`.
1. Install [rbenv][13] and [ruby-build][19]. Read their docs for up to date instructions. But as of 2022 August 28:
	- Run `git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv`.
	- Add `$HOME/.rbenv/bin` to your `$PATH`, usually done in `~/.bashrc`.
	  On recent versions of Fedora, `~/.bashrc` sources any files in the directory `~/.bashrc.d` (if it exists), so you don't have to edit `.bashrc` directly.
	  (To create the directory, run `mkdir ~/.bashrc.d`.)
	  For example, run ` echo 'PATH=""$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH""' >> ~/.bashrc.d/rbenv` (you can replace `~/.bashrc.d/rbenv` with `~/.bashrc` to modify `.bashrc` directly).
	- Additionally, add `eval ""$(rbenv init - bash)""` to your shell: `echo 'eval ""$(rbenv init - bash)""' >> ~/.bashrc.d/rbenv` (again, you may choose to modify `.bashrc` directly).
	- Restart (close and reopen) your shell for the changes to take effect.
	- Create the plugins directory for rbenv: `mkdir ~/.rbenv/plugins`.
	- Get ruby-build: `git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build`.
	- Check that ruby-build has been installed correctly: `rbenv install --list`.
1. Install Ruby 3.1.2: `rbenv install` inside this project root directory (it reads `.ruby-version`).
1. Check that `ruby -v` inside this project gives you version 3.1.2.
1. Install dependencies to build gems: `(sudo) dnf install libpq-devel`.
1. Install gem dependencies: `bundle install`.
1. Generate or link your SSH keys; Gamocosm expects an `id_gamocosm` private key and an `id_gamocosm.pub` public key in the project root. Gamocosm uses this to connect to and set up the servers it creates. Gamocosm officially only supports `ed25519` keys; somewhere down the stack, `rsa` keys are not supported (`ed25519` keys are considered more secure):
	- To generate new keys, run: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`. The default path saves to `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. If you leave it here, SSH will automatically try this key when SSHing (e.g. if you need to debug a Digital Ocean droplet created by your Gamocosm). Careful not to overwrite if you already have an existing `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` key!
	- To link a key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, run `ln -s ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 id_gamocosm`, and similarly for the corresponding public key (with `.pub` extension).
		- If you plan on running Gamocosm in a container, note that `podman`/`docker` cannot copy symlinks; use `cp` to copy the files instead.
	- `id_gamocosm` and `id_gamocosm.pub` are ignored in Gamocosm's `.gitignore` so you don't have to worry about accidentally committing them.
1. Create your environment file: `cp template.env gamocosm.env`.
1. Make your environment file only readable (and writable) by the file owner (you): `chown 600 gamocosm.env`
1. Update the config in `gamocosm.env`. See below for documentation.
	- In particular, if you are following these instructions to setup a development environment, you will want to change `DATABASE_HOST` and `SIDEKIQ_REDIS_HOST` both to `localhost`.
1. Load environment variables: `source load_env.sh`. You will also need to do this in every new shell you run ruby/rails in.
1. Install `podman` (or `docker`): `(sudo) dnf install podman`.
1. Create the database container: `podman create --name gamocosm-database --env ""POSTGRES_USER=$DATABASE_USER"" --env ""POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$DATABASE_PASSWORD"" --publish 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 docker.io/postgres:14.5`.
1. Create the Redis container for Sidekiq: `podman create --name gamocosm-sidekiq-redis --publish 127.0.0.1:6379:6379 docker.io/redis:7.0.4`.
1. Start the containers: `podman start gamocosm-database gamocosm-sidekiq-redis`.
1. Setup the database: `bundle exec rails db:setup`.
1. Start the server: `bundle exec rails s`.
1. Start the Sidekiq worker: `bundle exec sidekiq`.
1. Optional: open the console: `bundle exec rails c`.

### Environment File
- `DATABASE_HOST`: May be a directory (for a Unix domain socket), or an IP/hostname (for a TCP connection). See below for more information.
- `DATABASE_PORT`: Required even for Unix domain sockets. The default should work on Fedora provided you didn't change the postgresql settings.
- `DATABASE_USER`: Hmmmm.
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: Hmmmm.
- `DIGITAL_OCEAN_API_KEY`: Your Digital Ocean API token.
- `DIGITAL_OCEAN_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE`: You should have generated or linked an `id_gamocosm` SSH key in the project root, with an (optional) passphrase.
- `SIDEKIQ_REDIS_HOST`: You can leave this as the default.
- `SIDEKIQ_REDIS_PORT`: You can leave this as the default.
- `SIDEKIQ_ADMIN_USERNAME`: HTTP basic auth for Sidekiq web interface.
- `SIDEKIQ_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: See previous.
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Hmmm.
- `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`: Hmmm.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE`: Shown on the bottom right of CloudFlare's control panel for the domain.
- `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY`: Only test, production.
- `MAIL_SERVER_*`: See [action mailer configuration][6] in the Rails guide.
- `CACHE_REDIS_HOST`: Caching for production. Is disabled/not used in development and test environments (see `config/environments/development.rb` and `config/environments/test.rb`).
- `CACHE_REDIS_PORT`: See previous.
- `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: Only production.
- `DEVELOPER_EMAILS`: Comma separated list of emails to send exceptions to.
- `BADNESS_SECRET`: Secret to protect `/badness` endpoint.

### Database configuration
**Database configuration is greatly simplified if you use a container image as described above.
However, the following information remains for reference, if you want to run PostgreSQL directly on your system.**

Locate your postgres data directory.
On Fedora this is `/var/lib/pgsql/data/`.

#### Connection
Locate `postgresql.conf` in your postgres data directory.
The convention is that commented out settings represent the default values.
For a Unix domain socket connection, `DATABASE_HOST` should be one of the values of `unix_socket_directories`.
In general, the default is `/tmp`.
On Fedora, the default includes both `/tmp` and `/var/run/postgresql`.
For a TCP connection, `DATABASE_HOST` should be one of the values of `listen_addresses` (default `localhost`).
The value `localhost` should work if you're running postgresql locally.
Your `DATABASE_PORT` should be the value of `port` in this file (default `5432`).

You can read more about connecting to postgresql at [postgresql's docs][22].

#### Authentication
Locate `pg_hba.conf` in your postgres data directory.
This file tells postgresql how to authenticate users. Read about it on the [PostgreSQL docs][1].
The Rails config `config/database.yml` reads from the environment variables which you should have set in and loaded from `gamocosm.env` via `source load_env.sh`.
The postgres user you use must be a postgres superuser, as rails needs to enable the uuid extension.
To create a postgres user ""gamocosm"":

- Switch to the `postgres` user: `(sudo) su --login postgres`.
- Run `createuser --createdb --pwprompt --superuser gamocosm` (`createuser --help` for more info).

Depending on what method you want to use, in `pg_hba.conf` add the following under the line that looks like `# TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD`.

- Type
	- `local` (Unix domain socket) or `host` (TCP connection)
- Database
	- Rails also needs to have access to the `postgres` database (to create new databases?)
	- `postgres,gamocosm_development,gamocosm_test,gamocosm_production`
- User
	- `gamocosm`
- Address
	- Leave blank for `local` type
	- Localhost is `127.0.0.1/32` in ipv4 and `::1/128` in ipv6. My system used ipv6 (postgres did not match the entry when I entered localhost ipv4)
- Method
	- trust
		- Easiest, but least secure. Typically ok on development machines. Blindly trusts the user
	- peer
		- Checks if the postgresql user matches the operating system user
		- Since `config/database.yml` specifies the database user to be ""gamocosm"", using this method is more troublesome, at least in development, because you have to either change that to your OS username and create a postgresql user with your username, or create a new OS account called ""gamocosm"" and a postgresql user ""gamocosm""
	- ident
		- Same as `peer` but for network connections
	- md5
		- Client supplies an MD5-encrypted password
		- This is the recommended method

Example: `local postgres,gamocosm_development,gamocosm_test,gamocosm_production gamocosm md5`.
You will have to restart postgresql (`(sudo) systemctl restart postgresql`) for the changes to take effect.

### Directory hierarchy
- `app`: main source code
- `bin`: rails stuff, don't touch
- `config`: rails app configuration
- `db`: rails app database stuff (schema, migrations, seeds)
- `lib`: rails stuff, don't touch
- `log`: 'nuff said
- `public`: static files
- `sysadmin`: stuff for the Gamocosm server (you can run your own server! This is a true open source project)
- `test-docker`: use docker container to test most of `app/workers/setup_server_worker.rb` (more below)
- `test`: pooteeweet
- `vendor`: rails stuff, don't touch

### Technical details
Hmmmm.

#### Data
- Gamocosm has a lot of infrastructure:
	- CloudFlare DNS API
	- Digital Ocean API
	- Digital Ocean servers/droplets
	- Minecraft and the server wrapper
	- Gamocosm Rails server
	- Gamocosm Sidekiq background workers
- Avoid state and duplicating data (less chance of corruption, logic easier to debug than data)
- Idempotency is good

#### Error handling
- Methods that ""do things"" should return nil on success, or an object on error
- Methods that ""return things"" should use `String#error!` to mark a return value is an error
	- This method takes 1 argument: a data object (can be `nil`)
	- e.g. `'API response code not 200'.error!(res)`
	- `String#error!` returns an `Error` object; `Error#to_s` is overridden so the error message can be shown to the user, or the error data (`Error#data`) can be further inspected for handling
- You can use `.error?` to check if a return value is an error. `Error#error?` is overriden to return `true`
- This class and these methods are defined in `config/initializers/monkey_patches.rb`
- Throw exceptions in ""exceptional cases"", when something is unexpected (e.g. bad user input *is* expected) or can't be handled without ""blowing up""

#### Important checks
- `server.remote.exists?`: `!server.remote_id.nil?`
- `server.remote.error?`: whether there was an error or not retrieving info about a droplet from Digital Ocean
	- true if the user is missing his Digital Ocean API token, or if it's invalid
	- false if `!server.remote.exists?`
	- don't need to check this before `server.remote` actions (e.g. `server.remote.create`)
- `server.running?`: `server.remote.exists? && !server.remote.error? && server.remote.status == 'active'`
- `user.digital_ocean.nil?`: Digital Ocean API token missing
- `minecraft.node.error?`: error communicating with Minecraft wrapper on server
- `minecraft.running?`: `server.running? && !node.error? && node.pid > 0` (notice symmetry with `server.running?`)

#### Background workers
- Idempotent
- Keep blocks inside timeouts as simple as possible, cleanup outside of timeout, try to stick to plain old datatypes
	- Use `ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection do |conn|` if threads (e.g. timeout) access the database
- Run finite amount of times (keep track of how many times looped)
- Reset the state of the server if anything goes wrong (any exit points)
- Check that the remote exists and is not errored
- Log errors to user minecraft server, include 'Aborting' when not finishing
- 'Aborting' should always be followed by `server.reset_state` and `return`

#### Other useful stuff
- Development/test user (from `db/seed.rb`): email ""test@test.com"", password ""1234test"", has the Digital Ocean api token from `env.sh`
	- the current tests don't use this, and mock all HTTP requests/responses
- The Sidekiq web interface is mounted at `/sidekiq`
- Sidekiq doesn't automatically reload source files when you edit them. You must restart it for changes to take effect
- New Relic RPM is available in developer mode at `/newrelic`
- Run the console: `bundle exec rails c`
- Reset the database: `bundle exec rake db:reset`
- Reset Sidekiq jobs: `Sidekiq::Queue.new.each { |job| job.delete }` in the rails console
- Reset Sidekiq stats: `Sidekiq::Stats.new.reset` in the rails console
- The deployment scripts and configuration are in the `sysadmin/` directory
- List of `rake db` commands: [Stack Overflow][3]

## Tests
- `bundle exec rails test` or `./tests.sh`
- tests use WebMock to mock http requests (no external requests)
- `RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails <s|c>` to run the server or console (respectively) in test mode
- Note: the test server, unlike the dev server, does not automatically reload source files when you change them

### More testing by simulating a user server with Docker
Without a server to connect to, Gamocosm can't try SetupServerWorker or AutoshutdownMinecraftWorker.
""test-docker/"" contains a Dockerfile for building a basic Fedora container with an SSH server (simulating a bare Digital Ocean server).
If you set `$TEST_DOCKER` to ""true"", the tests will assume there is a running Docker Gamocosm container to connect to.

`tests.sh` will build the image, start the container, and delete the container for you if you specify to use Docker.
Otherwise, it will run the tests normally (equivalent to `bundle exec rails test`).
You should have non-root access to Docker.
You could also manage Docker yourself; you can look at the `tests.sh` file for reference.

Example: `TEST_DOCKER=true ./tests.sh`

## Overview

- **Asynchronous**  • MCsniperPY is asynchronous meaning it tends to be faster and more efficient than multithreaded name snipers
- **Open source** • MCsniperPY is open source, meaning you can look at everything that goes on behind the scenes to get you a name. This means you can be sure it doesn't steal your account.
- **Fast** • MCsniperPY is fast, but not so fast that your requests run out instantly.

You can use this feature to customize your skin load list so as to load your skins from any skin server you want.  
If you are the owner of skin server, you can use CustomSkinLoader to load skins from your server if one of the APIs has been actualized by your server.  
  
### HD Skins Support  
Even though you don't have OptiFine and MCPatcher, CustomSkinLoader can still load and render HD skins.  
You can easily to get a better view of skins.  
  
### Skull Support  
Fixed skull loading bug, you can apply any skin to your skull now.  
Dynamic skull supported.  
  
### Profile Cache  
- Decrease the frenquency of using the network.  
- Meanwhile, you can still load profiles when network is unavailable.(*)  

*Only when it is opened in configratulation.  
  
### Local Skin  
Load skins without a skin server.  
Furthermore, by using this function you can preview your skins in game and even change the default skin and model.  
You can load local skins by using any API (excluding MojangAPI).  
*While using default configratulation, just put your skins into `.minecraft/CustomSkinLoader/LocalSkin/(skin|cape)s/{USERNAME}.png`.  
   
### Extra List  
A json file generated by skin servers which supports this feature.  
To add a server to your load list, users just need to put the file into `.minecraft/CustomSkinLoader/ExtraList` .  
  
### Transparent Skin Support  
The problem of incorrectly rendering textures has been fixed.  
  
### Spectator Menu Fixed  
By using this mod, you can see correct avatar of players in Spectator Menu rather than steve and alex.

If you want to apply to add other skin server to default list, please go to [issue](https://github.com/JLChnToZ/MCCustomSkinLoader/issues).  
  
## To Skin Server Owner  
CustomSkinLoader is designed for loading from any server, which makes the mod complex.  
It's not a good idea to refer to CustomSkinLoader's source code to develop your own skin mod.  
It's recommended to use CustomSkinLoader for your server directly.  
Furthermore, you can add your server to 'Default Load List'.  
You can also use 'ExtraList' which makes it easier for users to add your server into load list.

## Development Environment Setup

Project Red uses a standard Forge Gradle environment. Setup steps should be the same as most other mods:

1. Create a new folder and check out the repository:
   ```
   mkdir ~/projectred && cd ~/projectred
   git checkout https://github.com/MrTJP/ProjectRed.git .
   ```
2. Setup a new workspace with a decompiled copy of Minecraft:
   ```
   ./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
   ```
3. You can now either set up Eclipse or IntelliJ Idea as your IDE.

   For Eclipse:
   * Generate an Eclipse project with `./gradlew eclipse`
   * Import the generated project with `File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace` 
    
   For Intellij Idea:
   * Open IntelliJ and from the splash screen, select `Import Project`
   * Point IntelliJ to the `./build.gradle` file in the git repo
   * Close IntelliJ and run `./gradlew genIntellijRuns` to complete setup
   
4. If you'd like to contribute changes, you'll need to create your own fork of ProjectRed, push your changes, and then open a Pull Request for review.

### Building Locally
You can build a locally checked out copy of the repository by simply running:
```
./gradlew build
```
The built jars will be found in `./build/libs`.

300,MinecraftPhi/MinecraftPhi-modules,mcfunction,"# Minecraft Phi - Shared Utilities for Minecraft Datapacks
Phi is a library of utilities for minecraft datapacks that intends to unify data storage and manipulation in minecraft 1.16+

Phi is split into multiple optional modules that each add some piece of functionality.
There are plans to create a transpiler with direct support for Phi to ease the use of various advanced features.

## Setup
Each module contains a datapack that can be added to the `datapacks` folder of your world. In the future some modules will not be able to be downloaded from the repo as they will require the transpiler, however for now all modules are currently `distributable`, meaning they are already in the standard datapack format.

Upon loading the world, or on `/reload`, players will be prompted to complete the setup by clicking on the message, which will show every 5 seconds until the setup is complete. This can only be done by operators, and causes the chunk at block (-30000000, 1600) to be force loaded (chunk -1875000, 100), in every dimension.

## Usage
Phi adds 4 blocks to the world for various uses that are shared between datapacks:
- (-30000000 0 1600): A jukebox with an item in it
- (-30000000 0 1601): A command block running a function tag
- (-30000000 0 1602): A shulker box
- (-30000000 0 1603): A sign

Some bedrock is also placed directly above these blocks to protect them.  
These blocks must **not** be destroyed by any datapack, at any point, for any reason.  
The rest of the chunk, from y=2 and above, is freely available for any use by datapacks. However, these blocks can not be expected to remain untouched by other datapacks, this area is for temporary storage only.

Phi also uses an entity with the UUID of ec-0-0-0-1, for various utilities. At the end of every tick it will make sure the entity is in the loaded chunk, and has not been killed. DO NOT kill this entity, Phi and many datapacks using Phi rely on this entity existing. If you do kill this entity, it will be summoned again at the end of the tick, so everything should recover in one tick, but things may glitch or fail while this entity is dead.

More details on what these are used for, and what modules are currently available, see the [Phi wiki](https://github.com/MinecraftPhi/MinecraftPhi-modules/wiki)"
301,federicodangelo/CubeWorld,C#,"CubeWorld
=========

Minecraft-like game demo made using Unity 3D.

The interesting part is that the terrain generation and tiles definition is very easy to configurate since all of it is in XML files located at ""CubeWorld/Assets/Resources"", even the rules used to update the voxels in the engine are defined in there.

The project is split in 3 parts:

- CubeWorldLibrary: Base voxel game library, made in pure C# using Visual Studio 2008, implements simulation logic, sectors, items, tiles update logic, MULTIPLAYER support (yes, it has a very basic multiplayer support :-) )

- CubeWorld: Demo game made in Unity that uses CubeWorldLibrary

- CubeWorldWeb: Small Google App Engine application that handles the discovery of multiplayer games, when you create a server it automatically publishes it's IP to this web server for discovery by other clients.

It'll also be nice if you starred the project <3 (It pretty much means 'like' & it's free)

## Versions
Mainly we support [1.8.x](https://getbukkit.org/get/WAH0jXqYA2s3Gzzg3toWHG1R3lHNCNZY) & 1.14.x servers. Other versions are untested and support will generally not be provided when using other versions. I recommend TacoSpigot or PaperSpigot, but as a bare minimum I recommend you use Spigot over Bukkit or CraftBukkit.

## Support <3
We use yourkit for performance tuning of this project

YourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools 
for monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.
YourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler), 
[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/), [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor)

## How to install
0. Use Spigot on version [1.8.x](https://getbukkit.org/get/WAH0jXqYA2s3Gzzg3toWHG1R3lHNCNZY) or 1.14 (these are the only officially supported ones)
0. You can buy a Minecraft server from [here](https://mcprohosting.com/order?aff=81875) unless you already have a host or you can self-host it.
0. Configure the server how you want it in server.properties
0. Then just drop the ""MinecraftBut.jar"" into the ""/plugins"" folder of the server
0. Start the server and you're done
**Sidenote**: You could probably get away with using PaperSpigot or TacoSpigot, as they're variants of Spigot. You might even be able to use Bukkit and CraftBukkit, however, only Bukkit inherited ""jars"" are supported, so that means no Sponge etc. but modified spigot jars should be fine.

## Permissions

```

```
/MinecraftBut changeworld <WorldName>
/mb cw <Name>
```
Change the world that the plugin is running on, use case is just for Multiverse support

Note: I will not support the plugin running on multiple worlds at once, as it's out of the scope of common need of the YouTubers, however I think it works in the Nether and The End.

### How To set up the work environment
https://youtu.be/l7zyhCOyD4A

### Tools used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) this should already be install on most common IDEs 
* [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#1-8-8)
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/download)

### Download code
```
git clone git@github.com:HeathLoganCampbell/MinecraftBut.git
```
A folder called  ""MinecraftBut"" is now created, so from now on you can cd to this folder and type
``git pull`` to download changes made

### Add a Senerario
Simply extend Senerario, like so:
```java
public class DummyExample extends Senerario {
 //This allows players to edit the field through the command 
 //'/mb s DummyExample someNumberToEdit 1' which sets the value to 1
 @Optional
 private int someNumberToEdit = 5;

 public DummyExample(ButWorld butWorld) {
  super(""Dummy Name"", butWorld, XMaterial.ANVIL.parseMaterial(), new String[] {
   ""This is a description of the senerario""
  });
 }

 //called when Senerario is enabled
 @Override
 public void onStart() {
  //If you have a repeating task, I guess using repeat(runnable, ticks)
  //which auto cancels on disabl
  this.repeat(() -> {}, 20l * 1);
 }

 //called when Senerario is disalbed
 @Override
 public void onFinish() {

 }

 //Registers when the Senerario is enabled
 @EventHandler
 public void onPlayerMove(PlayerMoveEvent e) {
  Player player = e.getPlayer();
  player.sendMessage(""Hey "" + someNumberToEdit);
 }
}
```

Then simply go to the games.bevs.minecraftbut.MinecraftButPlugin class
```java
// and add the following line in games.bevs.minecraftbut.MinecraftButPlugin
private void populateScenerarios(ButWorld butWorld)
{
  ...
  this.scenerarioManager.registerSenerario(new DummyExample(butWorld));
}
```

## Contributing
- [Developer Setup](https://github.com/nsporillo/GlobalWarming/wiki/Developer-Setup-and-Installation)
- There is a Kanban board on Github where I'll be prioritizing work, feel free to help work on any of the tasks.
- Pull requests welcome! This is a very new project and I appreciate contributions.

## Install
+ Download and install mysql: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
  + Setup a user that can create tables. 
  + Add a schema called GlobalWarming (if your mysql is configured to only allow lowercase schemas, globalwarming with lowercase works, you just have to change that config in config.yaml below)
+ Setup and install BuildTools with it's Prerequisites (java and git): https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/
+ Setup a Spigot server using these instructions: https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/
  + Copy the spigot.jar for the build tools install to a new directory with the batch script from the Spigot server install, making sure to edit the batch script with the amount of Ram for the server and the correct file name
+ Run the server batch script to get all of the folders created
+ Copy GlobalWarming.jar into the plugins folder in your server directory
+ Run the server again now that you have the plugin.  This will create a GlobalWarming folder in the plugins folder.
+ Edit config.yaml in the GlobalWarming folder to specify your mysql db username and password.
+ You should be able to run the server with the GlobalWarming plugin successfully now and connect to your server from the Minecraft Game.

## Overview
+ Adds the concept of greenhouse gases (CO2) in the worlds atmosphere 
+ Furnaces emit CO2 when players smelt items
+ Farmed Animals emit CH4 when they are killed
+ Trees (instantly) absorb CO2 when they grow from a sapling
+ As CO2 levels rise, global temperature rises because of the [Greenhouse Effect](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/grnhse.html)

## Purpose
+ Ever had the hankering to turn a game meant for fun into an emulator of one of the modern world's toughest challenges?
+ Observe the [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#In_environmental_studies) first hand! 
+ Players are best off when they co-operate and agree to reduce their emissions
+ However, each player typically believes they are better off for themselves to emit as much as they wish. 
+ Avoiding a [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) might be fun! If the players don't play nice and end up dealing with the consequences, they might decide to agree to fix the planet. 

## Mechanics 
+ Every furnace burn causes a ""Contribution"" to emissions with an associated numerical value (based on the model)
+ Every tree growth causes a ""Reduction"" from emissions with an associated numerical value (based on the model)
+ The global temperature is a function of the net global carbon score. 
+ As the global temperature rises, the frequency and severity of negative climate damages increases.
+ Players can purchase ""carbon offsets"" which creates a tree-planting bounty for other players to fulfill. 

## Challenges
+ Designing a default model that doesn't quickly destroy worlds
+ Efficiently applying in-game mechanics changes

## Features
+ Scoreboard Integration - Players can compete for carbon neutrality! The worst polluters can be shamed.
+ Economy Integration - Set up tree-planting bounties 
+ Carbon Scorecard - Each player can see their latest carbon footprint trends via the command line.
+ Multi-world - Associate emissions in the end or nether worlds to the primary overworld with ease.
+ Custom Models - The inner numerical workings are as configurable as possible. Set thresholds, probabilities, and distributions.
+ Database storage - Load data on startup, queue DB changes to be done async and at intervals (instead of as they happen, that'd kill performance), and empty queue on shutdown. 
+ Highly configurable - Almost everything will have some degree of configuration to suit your server's needs.
+ Efficient - Despite major mechanics changes and an extensive event listening setup, GlobalWarming is fast.

## Negative Climate Damages (Sample Model)
Higher temps inherit the damages from the lower temps

| Global Temp | Effect 1 | Effect 2 | Effect 3 | Effect 4 |
| ------ | ------------ | ------- | --------|-----------|
| 14.0 C | None | | | |
| 15.0 C | Some mobs spawn less | some mobs spawn more | | |
| 16.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Some fish die | Ice/Snow stops forming | |
| 17.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Flora species growth stunted | Aquatic life stops spawning | Ocean flora/fauna die |
| 18.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Area Potion Effect Clouds | Farm yields lower | Snow/Ice melts |
| 19.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Forest Fires | Slower Health Regen | Frequent T-Storms | |
| 20.0 C | +1 Sea level rise | Severe Forest Fires | Violent T-Storms | Permanent Slowness Effect |

These are just a sample of the possible effects, these will be configurable and implement randomness and probabilities.

305,Phyremaster/papermc-docker,Shell,"# PaperMC Docker
This is a Linux Docker image for the PaperMC Minecraft server.

PaperMC is an optimized Minecraft server with plugin support (Bukkit, Spigot, Sponge, etc.).
This image provides a basic PaperMC server. All customizations are left to the user.
# Usage
It is assumed that the user has already acquired a working Docker installation. If that is not the case, go do that and come back here when you're done.
## Command
With this image, you can create a new PaperMC Minecraft server with one command (note that running said command indicates agreement to the Minecraft EULA). Here is an example:

```sudo docker run -p 25565:25565 phyremaster/papermc```

While this command will work just fine in many cases, it is only the bare minimum required to start a functional server and can be vastly improved by specifying some...
## Options
There are several command line options that users may want to specify when utilizing this image. These options are listed below with some brief explanation. An example will be provided with each. In the example, the part that the user can change will be surrounded by angle brackets (`< >`). Remember to *remove the angle brackets* before running the command.
- Port
  - This option must be specified. Use port `25565` if you don't know what this is.
  - Set this to the port number that the server will be accessed from.
  - If RCON is to be used, this option must be specified a second time for port `25575`.
  - `-p <12345>:25565`
  - `-p <12345>:25565 -p <6789>:25575`
- Volume
  - Set this to a name for the server's Docker volume (defaults to randomized gibberish).
  - Alternatively, set this to a path to a folder on your computer.
  - `-v <my_volume_name>:/papermc`
  - `-v </path/to/files>:/papermc`
- Detached
  - Include this to make the container independent from the current command line.
  - `-d`
- Terminal/Console
  - Include these flags if you want access to the server's command line via `docker attach`.
  - These flags can be specified separately or as one option.
  - `-t` and `-i` in any order
  - `-ti` or `-it`
- Restart Policy
  - If you include this, the server will automatically restart if it crashes.
  - Stopping the server from its console will still stop the container.
  - It is highly recommended to only stop the server from its console (not via Docker).
  - `--restart on-failure`
- Name
  - Set this to a name for the container (defaults to a couple of random words).
  - `--name ""<my-container-name>""`

There is one more command line option, but it is a bit special and deserves its own section.
### Environment Variables
Environment variables are options that are specified in the format `-e <NAME>=""<VALUE>""` where `<NAME>` is the name of the environment variable and `<VALUE>` is the value that the environment variable is being set to. Please note that setting an evironment variable with no value does not leave it at default; instead, this sets it to an empty string, which may cause issues. This image has four environment variables:
- Minecraft Version
  - **Name:** `MC_VERSION`
  - Set this to the Minecraft version that the server should support.
  - Note: there must be a PaperMC release for the specified version of Minecraft.
  - If this is not set, the latest version supported by PaperMC will be used.
  - Changing this on an existing server will change the version *without wiping the server*.
  - `-e MC_VERSION=""<latest>""`
- PaperMC Build
  - **Name:** `PAPER_BUILD`
  - Set this to the number of the PaperMC build that the server should use (**not the Minecraft version**).
  - If this is not set, the latest PaperMC build for the specified `MC_VERSION` will be used.
  - Changing this on an existing server will change the version *without wiping the server*.
  - `-e PAPER_BUILD=""<latest>""`
- RAM
  - **Name:** `MC_RAM`
  - Set this to the amount of RAM the server can use.
  - Must be formatted as a number followed by `M` for ""Megabytes"" or `G` for ""Gigabytes"".
  - If this is not set, Java allocates its own RAM based on total system/container RAM.
  - `-e MC_RAM=""<4G>""`
- Java options
  - **Name:** `JAVA_OPTS`
  - **ADVANCED USERS ONLY**
  - Set to any additional Java command line options that you would like to include.
  - By default, this environment variable is set to the empty string.
  - `-e JAVA_OPTS=""<-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC>""`
## Further Setup
From this point, the server should be configured in the same way as any other Minecraft server. The server's files, including `server.properties`, can be found in the volume that was specified earlier. The port that was specified earlier will probably need to be forwarded as well. For details on how to do this and other such configuration, Google it, because it works the same as any other Minecraft server.
# Technical
This project *does **NOT** redistribute the Minecraft server files*. Instead, the (very small) script that is inside of the image, `papermc.sh`, downloads these files from their official sources during installation.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This is an unofficial project. I did not create PaperMC. [This is the official PaperMC website.](https://papermc.io/)

## Mod Description

Vampires are fast, strong and bloodthirsty entities, which do not like the sun, but don't fear the night, and the best thing is: You can become one!

This mod allows you to become a vampire with all its benefits and drawbacks.

After being bitten by a vampire or manually injecting some vampire blood you get an effect called ""Sanguinare Vampiris"" which eventually turns you into a vampire.

For a more detailed description head over to the Minecraft Forum or the Curseforge page.

## API
Vampirism has an API you can use to add blood values to your mod's creatures or make them convertible and more. For more information and an overview checkout the wiki https://wiki.vampirism.dev/docs/api/intro.
#### Setup Gradle build script
You should be able to include it with the following in your `build.gradle`:
```gradle
repositories {
    //Maven repo for Vampirism
    maven {
        url = ""https://maven.maxanier.de/releases""
    }
}
dependencies {
    //compile against the Vampirism API
    compileOnly fg.deobf(""de.teamlapen.vampirism:Vampirism:${mc_version}-${vampirism_version}:api"")
    //at runtime (in your development environment) use the full Vampirism jar
    runtimeOnly fg.deobf(""de.teamlapen.vampirism:Vampirism:${mc_version}-${vampirism_version}"")
}
```

#### Choose a version

`${mc_version}` gets replaced by the current Minecraft version. (i.e. `1.16.5`)
`${vampirism_version}` gets replaced by the version of Vampirism you want to use (i.e `1.7.12`)

For a list of available Vampirism version,
see [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vampirism-become-a-vampire) or
the [maven listing](https://maven.maxanier.de/de/teamlapen/vampirism/Vampirism/) .

These properties can be set in a file named `gradle.properties`, placed in the same directory as your `build.gradle`
file. Example `gradle.properties`:

```
mc_version=1.16.5
vampirism_version=1.7.12
```

#### Rerun Gradle setup commands

Please run the commands that you used to set up your development environment again. E.g. `gradlew`
or `gradlew build --refresh-dependencies`
Refresh/Restart your IDE afterwards.

#### Run Vampirism in a deobfuscated environment

Vampirism uses **mixins**. To be able to apply them in a deobfuscated environment using a different set of mappings (
from the one Vampirism uses) you have to enable remapping the refmap:
Add

```
     property 'mixin.env.remapRefMap', 'true'
     property 'mixin.env.refMapRemappingFile', ""${projectDir}/build/createSrgToMcp/output.srg""
```

to your run configurations in your `build.gradle` and then regenerate your IDE run configurations (`genIntelliJRuns` or
similar). If that does not work you can also try `property 'mixin.env.disableRefMap', 'true'`
If you still run into issues with the mixins you can also set `mixin.env.ignoreRequired` to `true`. However, not all of
Vampirism will work correctly then.

#### Examples

Checkout this example project: https://github.com/TeamLapen/VampirismAPIExample

If you want to create an addon which access all of Vampirism's classes, not just the API, checkout
this https://github.com/TeamLapen/VampirismAddonExample and consider contacting @maxanier.

## Code Structure

The _minecraft_version_ branch serves as the main development branch. There might be older (stable) branches for the
same MC version suffixed with the Vampirism main version.  
It may receive bugfixes until the latest branch is released.  
The source code is currently divided into three parts, which might be split in the future.

#### Vampirism
Located in de.teamlapen.vampirism  
Contains the mod source code. Depends on the other two parts.  
#### Vampirism API
Located in de.teamlapen.vampirism.api  
Designed to be used by mods that only optionally interact with Vampirism as well as addon mods depending on Vampirism.  
#### VampLib/TeamLapen Lib
Located in de.teamlapen.lib
Independent mod (Contains @Mod).  
Provides Helpers and Registries to automate stuff like EntityUpdates.
Provides abstract classes/default implementations/interfaces to simplify things (located under de.teamlapen.lib.lib).  

## Setting up the development environment
If you would like to compile your own versions or even contribute to Vampirism's development you need to set up a dev environment.
The following example instructions will set up IntelliJ (Free community edition or Non-Free Ultimate edition). If you already have a setup or want to use another IDE, jump [here](#eclipse-or-other-ides).

#### IntelliJ
1. Make sure you have the Java **JDK** (minimum Java 8) as well as the IntelliJ IDE installed.
2. If you want to contribute to the development (via pull requests), fork Vampirism on Github.
3. (Optionally) Install Git, so you can clone the repository and push changes.
4. Clone (`git clone https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism`) or [download](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism/archive/refs/heads/1.16.zip) Vampirism to a new ""Vampirism"" folder.
5. In IntelliJ use `New...` -> `New from Version Control` -> Fill out repo, directory and name
6. After cloning is done IntelliJ offers you to import an unlinked Gradle Project. Click this.
7. Refresh the gradle project  
8. Run `genIntellijRuns` and edit the run config to use the correct module
9. Make sure `Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> 'Add runtime assertions for not-null-annotated methods and parameters' is disabled` (Unfortunately required, requires rebuild if the project has been built before)
10. You might have to modify the projects' compiler output path  


That's it.

#### Eclipse or other IDEs
If you would like to set up Vampirism in another way or another IDE, you should pay regard to the following points.  
1. Make sure `src/main/java`, `src/api/java` and `src/lib/java` are marked as source folders and `src/main/resources` and `src/lib/resources` are marked as resource folders.  
2. Vampirism might have a few dependencies (e.g. Waila), which are specified in the gradle files and should be automatically downloaded and added when you run `ideaModule` or `eclipse`.  
3. Vampirism requires at least Java 8 

### Code Style
The code style used in this project is the IntelliJ default one.  
For Eclipse, you can use the settings created by @Cheaterpaul [FormatFile](https://gist.github.com/Cheaterpaul/1aa0d0014240c8bd854434b5147804df) [ImportOrder](https://gist.github.com/Cheaterpaul/594d16f54358bdca6ea5e549f81b3589)

## Licence
This mod is licenced under [LGPLv3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism/master/LICENCE) ***except*** for the following parts:

##### Textures
Any textures included in this mod are licenced under the following terms:
```
Any textures (and models) included in the mod may be used, remixed and distributed for anything related to Vampirism (fan art, addon mods, forks, reviews, ...) excluding resource packs.
If you want to use them in a resource/texture pack, you must credit the Vampirism project or the individual creator where applicable and it must not be used commercially.
```

# Usage
At the heart of Brigadier, you need a `CommandDispatcher<S>`, where `<S>` is any custom object you choose to identify a ""command source"".

A command dispatcher holds a ""command tree"", which is a series of `CommandNode`s that represent the various possible syntax options that form a valid command.

## Registering a new command
Before we can start parsing and dispatching commands, we need to build up our command tree. Every registration is an append operation,
so you can freely extend existing commands in a project without needing access to the source code that created them.

Command registration also encourages the use of a builder pattern to keep code cruft to a minimum.

A ""command"" is a fairly loose term, but typically it means an exit point of the command tree.
Every node can have an `executes` function attached to it, which signifies that if the input stops here then this function will be called with the context so far.

Consider the following example:
```java
CommandDispatcher<CommandSourceStack> dispatcher = new CommandDispatcher<>();

dispatcher.register(
    literal(""foo"")
        .then(
            argument(""bar"", integer())
                .executes(c -> {
                    System.out.println(""Bar is "" + getInteger(c, ""bar""));
                    return 1;
                })
        )
        .executes(c -> {
            System.out.println(""Called foo with no arguments"");
            return 1;
        })
);
``` 

This snippet registers two ""commands"": `foo` and `foo <bar>`. It is also common to refer to the `<bar>` as a ""subcommand"" of `foo`, as it's a child node.

At the start of the tree is a ""root node"", and it **must** have `LiteralCommandNode`s as children. Here, we register one command under the root: `literal(""foo"")`, which means ""the user must type the literal string 'foo'"".

Under that is two extra definitions: a child node for possible further evaluation, or an `executes` block if the user input stops here.

The child node works exactly the same way, but is no longer limited to literals. The other type of node that is now allowed is an `ArgumentCommandNode`, which takes in a name and an argument type.

Arguments can be anything, and you are encouraged to build your own for seamless integration into your own product. There are some standard arguments included in brigadier, such as `IntegerArgumentType`.

Argument types will be asked to parse input as much as they can, and then store the ""result"" of that argument however they see fit or throw a relevant error if they can't parse.

For example, an integer argument would parse ""123"" and store it as `123` (`int`), but throw an error if the input were `onetwothree`.

When a command is actually run, it can access these arguments in the context provided to the registered function.

## Parsing user input
So, we've registered some commands and now we're ready to take in user input. If you're in a rush, you can just call `dispatcher.execute(""foo 123"", source)` and call it a day.

The result of `execute` is an integer that was returned from an evaluated command. The meaning of this integer depends on the command, and will typically not be useful to programmers.

The `source` is an object of `<S>`, your own custom class to track users/players/etc. It will be provided to the command so that it has some context on what's happening.

If the command failed or could not parse, some form of `CommandSyntaxException` will be thrown. It is also possible for a `RuntimeException` to be bubbled up, if not properly handled in a command.

If you wish to have more control over the parsing & executing of commands, or wish to cache the parse results so you can execute it multiple times, you can split it up into two steps:

```java
final ParseResults<S> parse = dispatcher.parse(""foo 123"", source);
final int result = execute(parse);
``` 

This is highly recommended as the parse step is the most expensive, and may be easily cached depending on your application.

You can also use this to do further introspection on a command, before (or without) actually running it.

## Inspecting a command
If you `parse` some input, you can find out what it will perform (if anything) and provide hints to the user safely and immediately.

The parse will never fail, and the `ParseResults<S>` it returns will contain a *possible* context that a command may be called with
(and from that, you can inspect which nodes the user entered, complete with start/end positions in the input string).
It also contains a map of parse exceptions for each command node it encountered. If it couldn't build a valid context, then
the reason why is inside this exception map.

## Displaying usage info
There are two forms of ""usage strings"" provided by this library, both require a target node.

`getAllUsage(node, source, restricted)`  will return a list of all possible commands (executable end-points) under the target node and their human readable path. If `restricted`, it will ignore commands that `source` does not have access to. This will look like [`foo`, `foo <bar>`].

`getSmartUsage(node, source)` will return a map of the child nodes to their ""smart usage"" human readable path. This tries to squash future-nodes together and show optional & typed information, and can look like `foo (<bar>)`.

314,darrelldavis/terraform-aws-minecraft,HCL,"# terraform-aws-minecraft

Terraform module to provision an AWS EC2 instance with an S3 backing store for running the [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en-us/) server.

## Features
* Download and play any available version of minecraft (downloaded from Mojang)
* Configurable syncing (frequency in minutes) of game folder on EC2 to S3
* When done, keep your game in S3 and pick up where you left off


## Usage
Example from latest version, using default values for everything:

```
module ""minecraft"" {
  source = ""git@github.com:darrelldavis/terraform-aws-minecraft.git?ref=master""
}
```
This will create all needed resources, including an S3 bucket to persist the game state. If you subsequently use `terraform destroy` the S3 bucket will not be destroyed as it will not be empty. You can choose to delete the bucket yourself with `aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name --force` or keep the game for future play. If the latter, add the bucket as `bucket_name` in your module call, for example:

```
module ""minecraft"" {
  source = ""git@github.com:darrelldavis/terraform-aws-minecraft.git?ref=master""
  bucket_name = ""games-minecraft-1234567890""
}
```
This will sync the bucket contents to the EC2 instance before starting minecraft and you can pick up play where you left off!

See [examples](./examples) directory for full example(s).

Example using original (legacy) version:

```
module ""minecraft"" {
  source = ""git@github.com:darrelldavis/terraform-aws-minecraft.git?ref=v1.0""
}
```

2. Install and configure a webserver that supports php, php-curl, php-mysql, and php-gd. (apache2 may be used)
3. Make sure your webserver is accessible.
4. Create databases `skinsrestorer` and `authme`
   . [Commands](https://gist.github.com/ITZVGcGPmO/a3dffa0db198919ae002efcad444ae34)
5. Download the latest **release** version from [**here!**](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinSystem/releases)
6. Put all of `The SkinSystem` into your **web-root** directory.

### :star: Let's start!!!

* **IMPORTANT** Enable **Database** in your **AuthMe** configuration. (Optional)

* **IMPORTANT** Enable **Database** in your **SkinsRestorer** configuration. Example configuration:

```YML
MySQL:
  Enabled: true
  Host: localhost
  Port: 3306
  Database: skinsrestorer
  SkinTable: Skins
  PlayerTable: Players
  Username: root
  Password: ''
```

If you don't have a database password, You should fill `''` into `Password` section.

1. Load The SkinSystem from your webserver. You should be shown an installation page looking something like this:

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/naeNvbO.png"" alt=""Installation view"" height=""240"">
  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/zIKwLTu.png"" alt=""Installation view"" height=""240"">
  <p align=""center"">( <b>Light</b> theme / <b>Dark</b> theme )</p>
</p>

2. Select **config.yml** for SkinsRestorer(and AuthMe), making sure database is enabled and working.
3. Now have fun with *changing* your skin! **Have a good time**. :smiley:

* **IMPORTANT** You can change the configuration later at `SkinSystem/config.nogit.php`
* **You can use this [template](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinSystem/wiki/Configuration) for making config file
  manually**.

* You can [follow](https://twitter.com/crafatar) us on twitter
* Open an [issue](https://github.com/crafatar/crafatar/issues/) on GitHub

# Installation

## Docker

```sh
docker network create crafatar
docker run --net crafatar -d --name redis redis
docker run --net crafatar -v crafatar-images:/crafatar/images -e REDIS_URL=redis://redis -p 3000:3000 crafatar/crafatar
```

## Manual

- Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) 12 (LTS)
- Install `redis-server`
- Run `npm install`  
  If that fails, it's likely because because of `node-canvas` dependencies. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki#installation-guides) to install them.
- Run `npm start`

Crafatar is now available at http://0.0.0.0:3000.

## Configration / Environment variables

See the `config.js` file.

# Operational notes

## inodes

Crafatar stores a lot of images on disk. For avatars, these are 8×8 px PNG images with an average file size of \~90 bytes. This can lead to issues on file systems such as ext4, which (by default) has a bytes-per-inode ratio of 16Kb. With thousands of files with an average file size below this ratio, you will run out of available inodes before running out of disk space. (Note that this will still be reported as `ENOSPC: no space left on device`).

Consider using a different file system, changing the inode ratio, or deleting files before the inode limit is reached.

## disk space and memory usage

Eventually you will run out of disk space and/or redis will be out of memory. Make sure to delete image files and/or flush redis before this happens.

# Tests
```sh
npm test
```

If you want to debug failing tests:
```sh
# show logs during tests
env VERBOSE_TEST=true npm test
```

It can be helpful to monitor redis commands to debug caching errors:
```sh
redis-cli monitor
```"

## Issues

Applied Energistics 2 crashing, have a suggestion, found a bug?  Create an issue now!

1. Make sure your issue has not already been answered or fixed and you are using the latest version. Also think about whether your issue is a valid one before submitting it.
    * If it is already possible with vanilla and AE2 itself, the suggestion will be considered invalid.
    * Asking for a smaller version, more compact version, or more efficient version of something will also be considered invalid.
2. Go to [the issues page](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/issues) and click [new issue](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/issues/new)
3. If applicable, use on of the provided templates. It will also contain further details about required or useful information to add.
4. Click `Submit New Issue`, and wait for feedback!

Providing as many details as possible does help us to find and resolve the issue faster and also you getting a fixed version as fast as possible.

Please note that we might close any issue not matching these requirements. 

## Applied Energistics 2 API

The API for Applied Energistics 2. It is open source to discuss changes, improve documentation, and provide better add-on support in general.

### Maven

Our authoritative Maven repository is Github Packages, which you can also use in your builds. Use of Github Packages 
[requires special setup](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-gradle-for-use-with-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages) 
to authenticate with your personal access token.

AE2 is also available without authentication from Modmaven. You can use the following snippet as example on how to add a repository to your gradle build file.

    repositories {
        maven {
            name ""Modmaven""
            url ""https://modmaven.dev/""
            // For Gradle 5.1 and above, limit it to just AE2
            content {
                includeGroup 'appeng'
            }
        }
    }

When compiling against the AE2 API you can use gradle dependencies, just add

    dependencies {
        compileOnly ""appeng:appliedenergistics2:VERSION:api""
    }

or add the `compileOnly` line to your existing dependencies task to your build.gradle.

Replace `VERSION` with the desired one. With 1.15+ we switched to using [semver](https://semver.org/). 
It is highly recommended following its specification and further considering an upper bound for the dependency version.
A change of the `MAJOR` version will be an API break and can lead to various crashes. Better to inform a player about the addon not supporting the new version until it could be tested or updated.

An example string would be `appeng:appliedenergistics2:7.0.0-alpha.6:api` for the API only or `appeng:appliedenergistics2:7.0.0-alpha.6` for the whole mod.

Builds obtained [here](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/releases) or via [maven](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/packages) should work in a development environment.
However the dependency might need to be wrapped in `fg.deobf()` like `runtimeOnly fg.deobf(""appeng:appliedenergistics2:VERSION:api"")`

## Building

1. Clone this repository via 
  - SSH `git clone git@github.com:AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2.git` or 
  - HTTPS `git clone https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2.git`

# Magneticraft
Magneticraft mod, more info in curseforge https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/magneticraft

***The mod is no longer in development***

Check out this cool [fork](https://github.com/Silfryi/Magneticraft) called [Magnetic Engineering](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/magnetic-engineering):
It turns Magneticraft into an Immersive Engineering + Addons companion/addon by removing most overlapping content.

### Compiling the mod
This is a small tutorial for non-modders to get the last version of the mod from github, so you can play with alpha versions of the mod.

Prerequisites:
- Have Java JDK installed, JRE it's not enough, you can get it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

Steps:
1. Download the project 

  ![alt text](https://image.prntscr.com/image/5o1YEu0VTN_amH5VVyxOjA.png ""Download location github"")
  
2. Extract the content of the zip file

  ![alt text](https://image.prntscr.com/image/vQhBvUFGQ5O6q9ruodQ2eA.png ""This should be the content of the folder"")
  
3. Open a terminal/cmd in the extracted folder

4. Run the command `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`
  
5. Run the command `./gradlew build`

  ![alt text](https://image.prntscr.com/image/N3HGL8m_RCm9Bk1MDokgFw.png ""Command"")
  
6. Wait until the mod is compiled

  ![alt text](https://image.prntscr.com/image/C31LCugcTZenH-BYgnucQw.png ""Command result"")
  
7. Grab the mod jar from `build/libs/<modname or something>.jar`
8. Profit!?!

### Running the mod
To run the mod you will need it's dependencies:
- [Forgelin](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/shadowfacts-forgelin?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=248453): or you will get a `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: kotlin/TypeCastException`
- ModelLoader: you can found the last version in /libs/modelloader-1.x.x.jar or compile from [here](https://github.com/Magneticraft-Team/ModelLoader).

# Borderless Minecraft
This application allows Minecraft to run as a borderless window. The default fullscreen mode does not allow other windows to be placed above it and does not allow users to mouse away from Minecraft without it minimizing.

## [Click here](https://github.com/Mr-Technician/BorderlessMinecraft/releases) to download or click ""Releases""

Basic usage is simple. If minecraft is already running, it will appear in the list of Minecraft sessions. Selecting one and clicking ""Go Borderless"" will remove all window decoration and set its size to match that of your computer's main monitor.

Clicking ""Restore Window"" will return it to a normal size and show the menu bar.

Clicking ""Set Title"" is for usage with multiple accounts, and will append ""(Second Account)"" to the existing title. Optionally, a custom text can be used instead and will be appended to the current game title. This is primarily useful when using OBS to record multiple Minecraft accounts by locking each game capture to a specific window title.

Alternatively, you can click ""Advanced"" and enter a size and position manually..

## Important Note: Disable Fullscreen before using Borderless Minecraft

## New features in 1.3.x

Settings are now saved when the app is closed.

The settings menu has six options:

- Start on boot: pretty self explanatory. :)
- Start minimized: Borderless Minecraft will launch minimized.
- Minimize to tray: Clicking minimized will hide Borderless Minecraft in the tray and remove it from the taskbar. You can click its tray icon to bring it back.
- Automatic borderless: Minecraft will go borderless autoamtically when launched. As of 1.3.0, this only works for vanilla and any java window with ""Minecraft"" in the title. It will use the advanced mode settings if they are specified.
- Preserve Taskbar: When going borderless, the taskbar will remain visible.
- Show all clients: Shows all Java apps instead of showing only Minecraft processes.

### Important note on automatic borderless:

Administrator privilages are required for automatic borderless as the app monitors when processes start and stop using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

323,KaptainWutax/SeedCracker,Java,"# SeedCracker [![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/KaptainWutax/SeedCracker/total.svg)]()

## Installation

 ### Vanilla Launcher

  Download and install the [fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

 ### MultiMC

  Add a new minecraft instance and press ""Install Fabric"" in the instance options.


  Then download the lastest [release](https://github.com/KaptainWutax/SeedCracker/releases) of SeedCracker and put the `.jar` file    in your mods directory, either `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods/` folder for the vanilla launcher or your own MultiMC instance folder.

## Usage

  Run minecraft with the mod installed and run around in the world. Once the mod has collected enough data, it will start the cracking process automatically and output the seed in chat. For the process to start, the amount of data that needs to be collected varies depending on the type of feature. `/seed data bits` can be used to see how much progress has been done. 
  
  ### Supported Structures
    - Ocean Monument
    - End City
    - Buried Treasure
    - Desert Pyramid
    - Jungle Temple
    - Swamp Hut
    - Shipwreck
  
  ### Supported Decorators
    - Dungeon
    - End Gateway
    - Desert Well
    - Emerald Ore

## Commands

  The command prefix for this mod is /seed.
  
  ### Render Command  
  -`/seed render outlines <ON/OFF/XRAY>`
    
  This command only affects the renderer feedback. The default value is 'XRAY' and highlights data through blocks. You can set    the render mod to 'ON' for more standard rendering. 
  
  ### Finder Command
  -`/seed finder type <FEATURE_TYPE> (ON/OFF)`
  
  -`/seed finder category (BIOMES/ORES/OTHERS/STRUCTURES) (ON/OFF)`
  
  This command is used to disable finders in case you are aware the data is wrong. For example, a map generated in 1.14 has different decorators and would require you to disable them while going through those chunks.

  ### Data Command
  - `/seed data clear`
  
  Clears all the collected data without requiring a relog. This is useful for multi-world servers.
  
  - `/seed data bits`
  
  Display how many bits of information have been collected. Even though this is an approximate, it serves as a good basis to guess when the brute-forcing should start.
  
  ### Cracker Command
  - `/seed cracker <ON/OFF>`
 
  Enables or disables the mod completely. Unlike the other commands, this one is persistent across reloads.
  
## Video Tutorial

https://youtu.be/1ChmLi9og8Q

## Upcoming Features

A list of features I have on my mind... they won't necessarily be implemented in this order if at all.

    - SHA2 brute-forcing, auxiliary to biomes search. /implemented
    - Dungeon floor cracker, fast lattice reversal. /implemented
    - Stronghold portal room cracker. (alternative to dungeon floor?)
    - Faster brute-forcing by reorganizing located features list. /implemented
    - End and nether biome finders. (nether would mostly be in preparation for 1.16) /implemented

## Setting up the Workspace

-Clone the repository.

-Run `gradlew genSources <idea|eclipse>`.

## Building the Mod

-Update the version in `build.gradle` and `fabric.mod.json`.

-Run `gradlew build`.

328,bitquest/bitquest,Java,"BitQuest A Minecraft mod that connects the game economics to a Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency nodes. It creates a Bitcoin wallet for every user that connects to the server, plus a common ""loot"" wallet used for rewards to players when killing mobs.

Players also can purchase land plots and stacks of items, transferring coins to the loot wallet, thus redistributing the spent cryptocurrency within the players.

You can use BitQuest to host your own Minecraft crypto server.

# Important Note
This project is an experiment and not a commercial product, bugs can, and most likely will happen. Please report any bugs to a moderator promptly, to ensure they are fixed. Also note that your wallet is not guaranteed, and you may experience issues with your balance. For this reason, it is highly recommended that you do not deposit large amounts, or anything you do not wish to place at risk by being tied to the server. In addition, if you are caught breaking rules and are banned, you forfeit your access to your server wallet, and all funds tied to it. With this said, rules are non-negotiable, and will be strictly enforced. This server is a fair server, and anyone abusing any system set in place will be punished. Please play fair, have fun, and enjoy the server

# Features
## Bitcoin Wallet
The [BitQuest](https://bitquest.co/) server and every player has a bitcoin address. Any player can receive and send bitcoin to any address inside or outside the game. This is useful for buying materials, selling crafts, trading, tipping, etc.
![A player just joined the server](http://i.imgur.com/1A6wkaB.png)
![The player can see it's bitcoin balance](http://i.imgur.com/5g5pBXB.png)

## Loot
Every time a player kills an enemy (mob) there is a chance to get loot. If that is the case the server makes a transaction directly from the server address to the player address.
![A player got loot](http://i.imgur.com/cxqXmt2.png)

## Player to player transactions
You can send Bitcoin to an external wallet with /transfer:
```
/transfer <amount> <recipient-bitcoin-address>
```

Additionally, players can send Bitcoin to other players via /send:
```
/send <amount> <username>
```

# Play Bitquest

Official BitQuest server is not online anymore, but you can host your own server using Docker or Bukkit.

# Hosting a BitQuest server
There are two methods to create a Bitquest server: One involves running a Docker image with everything ready, and the other is to build the plugin from source and adding it to a Spigot instance.

## Hosting a Bitcoin or Dogecoin node
A requirement for BitQuest is a Full Node of Bitcoin Core or Dogecoin Core. Before starting a BitQuest server make sure you have a fully synched node with RPC access turned on.

## Using Docker
You can download the a (https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/explodi/bitquest)[official BitQuest docker image]. 
This image builds a bukkit server with the latest BitQuest version plugin installed.

You must also have a node running, and the connection info (RPC login, host, port) set in the environment variables. (See: configuration)

## Building the BitQuest Java Plugin
You can build the bitquest Java plugin that you can drop in to a Bukkit server. This will enable all BitQuest features on your server. 

### 1. Requirements

1. Java JRE+SDK (Version 1.8)
2. Maven


### 2. Compile BitQuest and generate a JAR file

```
make -B jar
```

This will create a BitQuest.jar in the target folder.

# Contributing
Before submitting a pull request, please format the code using checkstyle. To run checkstyle and check if there are warnings:

# Running a BitQuest server with Docker

Tou can use Docker to run a BitQuest server. There's also an [official BitQuest docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/explodi/bitquest/). The recommended way to configure the image is using a docker-compose.yml file that can link to a directory where the worlds are stored. An example is included here. 

## Configuration

Before running the server, the following environment variables must be set:

| Environment variable       | Description                             |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| BITQUEST_ADMIN_UUID        | Minecraft user ID for the root user     |
| BITQUEST_ENV               | Set to 'production' for a public server | 
| BITQUEST_NAME              | The name of your server                 |
| BITQUEST_NODE_HOST         | Host of the Node                        |
| BITQUEST_NODE_PORT         | Port of the Node                        |
| BITQUEST_NODE_RPC_USER     | Node RPC username                       |
| BITQUEST_NODE_RPC_PASSWORD | Node RPC password                       |

## Litematica
Litematica is a client-side schematic mod for Minecraft, with also lots of extra functionality
especially for creative mode (such as schematic pasting, area cloning, moving, filling, deletion).

It's primarily developed on MC 1.12.2 for LiteLoader. It has also been ported to Rift on MC 1.13.2,
and for Fabric on MC 1.14 and later. There are also Forge versions for 1.12.2, and Forge ports for 1.14.4+
are also planned, but Forge will need to start shipping the Mixin library before those can happen.

Litematica was started as an alternative for [Schematica](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/schematica),
for players who don't want to have Forge installed on their client, and that's why it was developed for Liteloader.

For compiled builds (= downloads), see:
* CurseForge: http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/litematica
* For more up-to-date development builds: https://masa.dy.fi/mcmods/client_mods/
* **Note:** Litematica also requires the malilib library mod! But on the other hand Fabric API is not needed.

## Compiling
* Clone the repository
* Open a command prompt/terminal to the repository directory
* On 1.12.x you will first need to run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`
  (unless you have already done it once for another project on the same 1.12.x MC version
  and mappings and the same mod loader, Forge or LiteLoader)
* Run `gradlew build` to build the mod
* The built jar file will be inside `build/libs/`

Notice
------

Well, it's been six months since we've seen SpaceManiac. In that time, Glowstone++, a fork, has become a lot more complete and advanced. As such, until SpaceManiac comes back, we recommend that those interested in Glowstone seek Glowstone++ out in their channel, `#glowstone` on Espernet - or [here on GitHub](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/GlowstonePlusPlus). Thanks for flying with us up until now!

Introduction
------------
Glowstone is a lightweight, from scratch, open source
[Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) server written in Java that supports plugins
written for the [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org) API.

The main goals of the project are to provide a lightweight implementation
of the Bukkit API and Minecraft server where exact vanilla functionality is
not needed or higher performance is desired than the official software can
deliver. Glowstone makes use of a thread-per-world model and performs
synchronization only when necessitated by the Bukkit API.

Features
--------
Glowstone has a few key advantages over CraftBukkit:
 * It is **100% open source**. While CraftBukkit and most other mods are open
   source, they rely on decompiled Minecraft source code. Glowstone's code is
   completely original.
 * Because of this, it is easy to contribute to Glowstone's development. The
   barrier of entry to contributions is lower because there is no need to work
   around decompiled source or maintain a minimal diff.
 * Glowstone supports all plugins written for the Bukkit API natively. In
   practice, some plugins may try to make use of parts of the API which are not
   yet implemented, but in a completed state Glowstone would support all plugins.
 * Glowstone's simplicity affords it a performance improvement over CraftBukkit
   and other servers, making it especially suited for situations where a large
   amount of players must be supported but Vanilla game features are not needed.
 
However, there are several drawbacks:
 * Glowstone **is not finished**. Nothing is guaranteed to work, though many things
   are likely to. If in doubt, ask in `#glowstone`.
 * Vanilla survival features are entirely absent (mobs, hunger, health, so on).
   Glowstone cannot yet replicate a vanilla survival environment. These will be
   added over time.
 * Bukkit plugins which expect the presence of CraftBukkit-specific code
   (that in the `org.bukkit.craftbukkit` or `net.minecraft.server` packages)
   will not work on Glowstone unless they are designed to fail gracefully.
 * Glowstone is not produced by the Bukkit team, and while we do make an effort
   to produce quality work, Glowstone does not undergo the same rigorious testing
   as the Bukkit project.
   
Some of the key features that have been implemented are:
 * World loading, saving, and streaming to players.
 * Player interaction with the world (building, digging).
 * Somewhat-complete inventory support.
 * A simple world generator (support for others through Bukkit).
 * World weather (rain, thunder/lightning).
 * Op, ban, IP ban, and whitelist support.
 * Many of the advanced API features of Bukkit.

Building and Running
--------------------
Glowstone can be built with the
[Java Development Kit](http://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) and
[Gradle](http://gradle.org). The command `./gradlew` will build Glowstone and
place the final jar in `build/libs/` with a filename ending in `-remapped.jar`.
Other tasks are listed under `./gradlew tasks`. A local installation of Gradle
can be used instead if desired.

Running Glowstone is simple because its dependencies are shaded into the output
jar at compile time. Simply execute `java -jar glowstone.jar` along with any
extra JVM options desired. A variety of command-line options are also available -
run `java -jar glowstone.jar --help` for more information.

By default, configuration is stored in the `config/` subdirectory and logs
are stored in the `logs/` subdirectory. The main configuration file is
`config/glowstone.yml`, which replaces CraftBukkit's `server.properties` and
`bukkit.yml`. Settings from these two files will be copied over to Glowstone's
configuration during the default configuration generation process.

Glowstone uses [JLine](http://jline.sf.net) for console input and colored
console output. The JLine console can be disabled in the configuration if a
flat console is desired.

Docs and Support
-------------
The best place to receive support is on the [Glowstone Forums](https://forums.glowstone.net/),
where you can ask a question and someone who knows the answer can respond.
If you prefer IRC, visit our IRC channel `#glowstone` on EsperNet (`irc.esper.net`).

User and contributor documentation and other articles can be found on the
[GitHub wiki](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/Glowstone/wiki).
Javadocs can be generated by using the `gradle javadoc` command and are
placed in the `build/docs/javadoc/` directory, but these are incomplete
in some places and in general the code is the best reference.

For documentation on the Glowkit API (an updated Bukkit which is used to
write plugins), see the [Glowkit Javadocs](http://build.greatmancode.com/job/Glowkit/javadoc/),
or visit the official [Bukkit Javadocs](http://jd.bukkit.org/).

336,SimplyProgrammer/Minecraft-Deobfuscator3000,,"# About
Deobfuscator3000 is a universal tool for deobfuscating minecraft mods! It meant to be upgraded and improved variant of BON that was abandoned by its authors a long time ago.
Compare to BON this one allows you to choose obfuscation mappings by your self and it can decompile and deobfuscate your mod all at once!
Deobfuscator3000 can also deobfuscate individual java files and it can also works with zip files not only jars!
It also has more user-friendly UI with tooltips, logging console and other things! <br>
Deobfuscator3000 is perfect choice for minecraft modders that lost their source code or for anyone that is interested in sources of other mods!

# How to use
1. As well as BON, Deobfuscator3000 is programmed in Java so you need Java to run it!
2. First you need to select deobfuscation mappings! These are excel files that tell the deobfuscator what to do with your mod! Defaulty there are mappings for 1.7.10 and 1.12.X and all what you need to do is write/select path to one of these folders into the first text field. If your mod is for different version, then you need to obtain mappings for this certain version! In this case the best thing you can do is download them from [MCP](http://www.modcoderpack.com/), unpack the downloaded zip and select ""conf"" folders path into first the text field!
3. Now you need to decompile your mods jar! For this, I recommend to use Procyon on this online [Java decompiler](http://www.javadecompilers.com/).
4. After decompiling your mod, all what you need to do is select the path of the downloaded zip into the second text field and hit ""Deobfuscate"" button that supposed to be active by this time. If it is not there is most likely something wrong with deobfuscation mappings path or mods zip path. In this case the path in the text area will be red otherwise there should be no problem!
5. After clicking on ""Deobfuscate"" button program will take a while to deobfuscate the selected mod using selected mappings. Unzipped folder with deobfuscated mod sources will appear on your desktop. Now you have decompiled and deobfuscated mod sources to work with.
## Since 1.2.0
Since application was wrapped into installer and procyon decompiler was implemented, using procedure is now far easier!
1. **Download and install deobfuscator from** [here](https://download-deobfuscator3000.netlify.app/files/Deobfuscator3000%20setup.exe)!
2. Select deobfuscation mappings or download them from [MCP](http://www.modcoderpack.com/)!
3. Select your mods .jar file and make sure that checkbox is checked!
4. Click on ""Deobfuscate"", wait for it to finish and you are basically done (decompiled and deobfuscate mod sources will appear in the same folder as original mod jar file)!

# Valid deobfuscation mappings composition
Deobfuscation mappings are instructions for deobfuscator! They supposed to be a .csv (excel format) file or group of 3 files, the fields, methods, and params (each is optional since 1.0.5 but must be at least one of them) in one folder! Inside these files there supposed to be some sort of map with keys and values! These keys supposed to be in the first column of excel file and must contains at last one ""\_"" or since 1.1.0, can alternatively starts with ""#"" and then do not need to contains ""\_""! And second column in excel file supposed to be the values for the keys. These values can be anything, there are no limits! But value should not be the same as key is and also should not be empty!

# Info
1. If your mods files were not deobfuscated correctly it is most likely not the deobfuscators fault but invalid mappings! Make sure your mappings are for same minecraft version as your mod is! If you have encountered some other issues please feel free to report it! Also always download the latest version of deobfuscator! 
2. Deobfuscator will unzip your .jar files while creating folders in process and during deobfuscation it will be editing created files in your system or even changing their extensions (.class -> .java) which is something that your antivirus might not like! In such a case, I would recommend disabling your antivirus or add Deobfuscator app as scan exception!

## Background
This is the repo for the Florin High School (Sacramento, CA) Python workshop at KPMG. In this workshop, you'll learn Python programming and programming concepts by writing methods to control in-game Minecraft activites, and then you will connect those actions to a Flask-based website to act as a controller. We distributed Rapsberry Pi to the students for them to take with them after the workshop. If you don't have a rapsberry pi, you can emulate one on any Mac, Windows or Linux computer by following the instructions in [this link.](https://azeria-labs.com/emulate-raspberry-pi-with-qemu/)

You'll learn: 

- Basic version control with Github
- Python Virtual Environments 
- Dependency Management 
- Variables
- If Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Backend Web Development concepts 

__All this culminating in a Flask-based Web controller for Minecraft Pi!__

## Useful Information

##### Create a script

Once the Pi has loaded and you are at the desktop screen, click on 
Menu then Programming and choose Python IDE3

Click file and select click script. To save, go to file then click save as.

We need to add an import for our script that will allow us to control Minecraft, type this code into the first line of your script

```python
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft 

mc = Minecraft.create()
```
**This import will need to be entered for every script you create**

You can move to a new line in a script by pressing enter

A script can be run by pressing f5 or going to the run option on the top menu bar

##### Load Minecraft 
Go to menu, go to games and click Minecraft. Bring this window alongside your Python script window so it is easier to use. You can move between the game and scripts by pressing the tab button.

In Minecraft click 'Create new world'. When this loads it will look something like the image below. Everyone’s will look different when it first loads. 
![Start](http://s8.postimg.org/8prlw8b1h/start.png)

##### Moving around the game

To move around the game, you can use the arrow keys and use the space button to jump. 

##### Hints

Look out for Pete the pig. For some questions he'll give hints on how to do them.

![pig](http://i.imgur.com/de99x5z.gif)

##### What if something goes wrong ?

If you get an error saying 'Syntax error' double check you have typed everything correctly and try running your script again.

### Targeted Curriculum
##### Key Stage 2

•   Design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals, including controlling or simulating physical systems; solve problems by decomposing them into smaller parts.

•   Use sequence, selection, and repetition in programs; work with variables and various forms of input and output.

##### Key Stage 3

•	Use 2 or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures, design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions.

[http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=80902](http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=80902)

### minecraft.sh

- copy the script into your minecraft server folder.
- allow the script to be executed 
#####     chmod +x minecraft.sh

- check the rights of the script user. Every folder specified in the 
configuration phase has to be available to him.
- edit the script to configure it (see the configuration section)

#### (optional)
- I strongly recommend using crontab to automate some of the process. I 
prefer to perform logs clean + server restart + sync + then all of my mappers at 4AM 
every day. 
- The 'logs' command should always be used BEFORE a restart, as 
the restart wipes the previous logs. I'm running hey0's servermod, which 
allows to have a log history, but that's not the case for everyone.
- I also recommend setting an Internet public folder, for the maps 
images to be displayed. People on my server love this feature, as they 
know a new map is generated every day, and they can see the evolution of 
our world.
- I made an alias to be able to use 'minecraft command' instead of 
'./minecraft.sh command'. It also enables the automatic completion, if 
you type 'mine' then press tab. Much quicker =) You can do this by 
editing /home/USER/.bashrc, and adding the line:

#####     alias minecraft=""/home/minecraft/minecraft.sh""

**(of course, change the path if needed)**

Considerations:
--------------

#### Space

This script uses rsync to update an offline folder with the latest world information. As maps become larger, time to completion when running mappers on them increases. Having saving turned off for 15-30 minutes while a new map is being generated isn't good for the users. Saving is now only turned off for the time it takes to sync the folders.

Because of this, your world size is effectively doubled when using this script. Whenever you issue the 'minecraft.sh sync' command, you will be shown the size of the two directories in KB.

#### Overviewer 

If using [Brownan's Overviewer](http://github.com/brownan/Minecraft-Overviewer) to create Google-like maps of your worlds, 
be sure you are using the --cachedir=/path/to/dir to change the location 
of the png files as you will start to take up considerable space since it
defaults to save the files inside of the world folder. This can grow backups
that are only 3mb to 99mb files. If you are not cleaning the logs, this will
start to consume a considerable amount of hard drive space.

#### Multiple Worlds

This script is also setup to work with multiple worlds. Worlds are found by looking for the level.dat file.
If that file is found, the script will consider that an additional world. Keep this in mind when you backup
your world folders as you may end up having operations performed on that folder when you didn't want it to
if you were to just create a copy of the folder in the same root directory 'cp world/ world_backup'. Actions
like sync and cartography will be affected.

Sync will create a copy of the entire world folder(s) into the location you have specified for the offline folder.

Cartography will also run on each found world and will save the images in a folder with the world name in the location
specified for the image output.

Configuration :
===============

There are several variables to set before you can run the script for the first time.
Open minecraft.sh with a text editor, and edit the following lines, at the beginning of the file :

**Main Settings**

    WORLD_NAME=""world""
This is the path to the world folder

    OFFLINE_NAME=$WORLD_NAME-offline
This is the name to the offline world folder that sync and all mapper functions use to process the world. This is saved in the same directory as your world folder.

    SCREEN_NAME=""minecraft""
This is the name of the screen the server will be run on

    MEMMAX=1024
This is the maximum size of RAM you want to allow the server to use, if you are not sure, keep this and MEMALOC identical.

    DISPLAY_ON_LAUNCH=1
Do you want the screen to be displayed each time the server starts? 1 if yes, 0 if no.

    MC_PATH=/home/minecraft
This is the path to your minecraft folder

    SERVER_OPTIONS=""""
This is where you would place any desired flags for running your server.

###### EXAMPLE:
    SERVER_OPTIONS=""-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2 -XX:+AggressiveOpts""

**Modifications**

    SERVERMOD=0
If you are running bukkit, this needs to be set to 1 _(better logging and automatic updating of the mod)_

    MODJAR=""craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar""
This is the name of the jar file for the server mod you are using. This allows you to use this script for a number of server
mods without having to adjust other parts of the script.

    RUNECRAFT=0
If you want your script to update runecraft automatically too, set this to 1

**Backups**

    BKUP_PATH=$MC_PATH/backup
This is the path to the backup folder. Map backups and old log entries will go there.

    BKUP_DAYS_INCR=3
How long will incremental map backups be kept? _(Only used with the './minecraft.sh backup full' command)_

    BKUP_DAYS_FULL=3
How long will full map backups be kept? _(Only used with the './minecraft.sh backup full' command)_

    BACKUP_FULL_LINK=${BKUP_PATH}/${WORLD_NAME}_full.tgz
Naming convention for full backups.

    BACKUP_INCR_LINK=${BKUP_PATH}/${WORLD_NAME}_incr.tgz
Naming convention for incremental backups.

**Logs**

    LOG_TDIR=/var/www/minecraftLogs
This is the path to the logs folder

    LOGS_DAYS=7
How long will the logs be kept? _(Only used with the './minecraft.sh logs clean' command)_

**Mapping**

    CARTO_PATH=$MC_PATH/carto
This is the path to c10t's cartography script

    MAPS_PATH=/var/www/minecraftMaps
This is the path to the world maps folder

    CARTO_OPTIONS=""-q -s""
This contains all of the options you want when running cartography.

    MAP_CHANGES=1
Set this to 1 if you want cartography to also create a 'changes.png' file that will show you what has changed since the last mapper, 0 will turn this feature off.

    BIOME_PATH=/home/minecraft/BiomeExtractor
This is the path to MinecraftBiomeExtractor.jar 

    MCOVERVIEWER_PATH=$MC_PATH/Overviewer/
This is the path to Overviewer (overviewer.py)

    MCOVERVIEWER_MAPS_PATH=/var/www/minecraft/maps/Overview/
This is the location where Overviewer will render

    MCOVERVIEWER_OPTIONS=""--rendermodes=lighting,night""
This contains all of the options you want when running Overviewer.

### Detailed Command Usage

##### ./minecraft.sh
Without arguments, the script will resume the server screen. 
(If you want to close the screen without shutting down the server, use 
CTRL+A then press D to detach the screen)
##### ./minecraft.sh status
Tells you if the servers seems to be running, or not.
##### ./minecraft.sh start [force]
Starts the server. If you know your server is not running, but the script believe it is, use the force option.
##### ./minecraft.sh stop [force]
Self explainatory
##### ./minecraft.sh restart [warn]
If the warn option is specified, it will display a warning 30s & 10s before the restart happens.
##### ./minecraft.sh logs [clean]
Parses logs into several files, grouped into a folder named with the date of the logging.
If the clean option is specified, it will move the older folders into the backup folder.
Again, this command should be issues before a server restart.

Note: If you run this command with Hey0, you will see a message that states something like: ""Found a log lock : server_##########""
This is not an error and just a notification message. Logs are being generated correctly.

##### ./minecraft.sh backup [full]
Displays a message to the players if the server is online, stops the writing of chunks, create a dated archive and backs up the 
world folder. If the full option is specified, it will delete the older incremental and full archives based on the settings.

#####./minecraft.sh say _message_
If the server is online, this will send the <message> to all users via the console.

Correct: ./minecraft.sh say ""This is a public message""

##### ./minecraft.sh tell _user_ _message_
If the server is online, this will send a whisper of <message> to <user>.

Correct: ./minecraft.sh tell test_user ""This is a private message""

##### ./minecraft.sh sync [purge]
This updates the offline folder to have the most recent information from the online folder This needs to be ran before you update any maps via 
the commands. The size of both folders will be displayed.

**The purge option will delete the offline folder before a sync is performed. This is useful for when you delete chunks from your online world and need those deletions to be transfered to the offline folder.**

##### ./minecraft.sh cartography [sync]
Displays a message to the players if the server is online, stops the writing of chunks, initiates c10t's cartography script.
I strongly recommend the MAPS_PATH to be an internet public folder.
**The sync option will sync the world before mapping occurs.**
##### ./minecraft.sh overviewer [sync]
Displays a message to the players if the server is online, stops the writing of chunks, initiates Brownan's Overviewer script.
**The sync option will sync the world before mapping occurs.**
I strongly recommend the MCOVERVIER_MAPS_PATH to be an internet public folder as well.
##### ./minecraft.sh biome [sync]
Running the extractor will update any biome information from new chunks.
**The sync option will sync the world before mapping occurs.**
##### ./minecraft.sh update
Stops the server if it is online, backs up the old binaries, downloads the last binaries from minecraft.net and restarts 
the server. If RUNECRAFT=1, then the latest version of Runecraft will be downloaded and injected into the JAR. This is 
the only way to have runecraft installed. If you want Runecraft, but not hMod, then you would set SERVERMOD=0 and RUNECRAFT=1.
You would then run _'./minecraft.sh update'_ to inject Runecraft into just the vanilla server jar (the latest one, of course).


### Future updates :
* Bugfixes ?
* Better log parsing, this one is realy primitive
* Anything you could think of.

#### Any advice on how to upgrade this script is very welcome.

MapWriter: A minimap mod for Minecraft


Instructions for development:

1) Run ""gradlew setupDecompWorkspace"" in the mapwriter folder.

2) Run ""gradlew eclipse"" if using the eclipse IDE. If it does not work you may
   need to copy the eclipse folder from a Forge src release into the mapwriter
   folder and retry the command.

3) Open eclipse and set the workspace directory to mapwriter/eclipse.

4) You should now be able to modify the code and test by using the ""Client"" Run
   Configuration.

Reobfuscation and Packaging:

1) Edit the version numbers in mapwriter.forge.MwForge and build.gradle.
   The version numbers in mcmod.info should automatically be set to the same
   versions as set in the build.gradle file.

2) Run ""gradlew reobf"".

3) The reobfuscated jar should be output to the mapwriter/build/libs folder.

Acknowledgements:

* Chrixian for the code to get death markers working.
* ProfMobius for the overlay API.
* taelnia for extrautils compatibility patch.
* LoneStar144 for minimap border and arrow textures.
* jk-5 for updating the mod to be compatible with Minecraft 1.7.

This is a Minecraft clone that will be used for an education YouTube series. I will link the YouTube series here once I begin creating it.

## To Build

> Note: Currently this code only supports Windows and Linux (almost)

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

In order to build this, you must have git installed. Then you can create a new directory where you want to install this code and open a command prompt. Then run:

```batch
git clone --recursive https://github.com/codingminecraft/StreamMinecraftClone
cd StreamMinecraftClone
build.bat vs2019
```

This should create a Visual Studio solution file, and all you need to do is double click the solution file, then build and run the project within Visual Studio.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Linux (Ubuntu)</summary>
In order to build this, you must have git and a few other dependencies installed. You cun run the following commands to ensure you have all the dependencies:

```bash
# Get the dependencies for libcurl
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev

# Get the dependencies for freetype
wget https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/freetype-2.10.4.tar.gz
tar xvfz freetype-2.10.4.tar.gz
cd freetype-2.10.4
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/freetype/2_10_4 --enable-freetype-config
make
make install
cd ..
rm -rf ./freetype-2.10.4
rm ./freetype-2.10.4.tar.gz

# Get dependencies for GLFW
sudo apt-get install xorg-dev

# Clone the repository and change into the directory
git clone --recursive https://github.com/codingminecraft/StreamMinecraftClone

# Compile and install GLFW
cd StreamMinecraftClone/Minecraft/vendor/GLFW
cmake .
make 
sudo make install
cd ../../../

# Finally build the project 
./build.sh gmake2
make Minecraft
```

If you ever need to rebuild the project simply run these two commands:
```bash
./build.sh gmake2
make Minecraft config=release
```

</details>

> Note: If you want to use a different build system, just run build.bat which will print out all available build systems.

**[Prebuilt ISO](https://while.io/mineassemble.iso) - [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDcr5dnellM)**

MineAssemble is a tiny bootable Minecraft clone written partly in x86 assembly.
I made it first and foremost because a university assignment required me to
implement a game in assembly for a computer systems course. Because I had never
implemented anything more complex than a ""Hello World"" bootloader before, I
decided I wanted to learn about writing my own kernel code at the same time.

Note that the goal of this project was **not** to write highly efficient
hand-optimized assembly code, but rather to have fun and write code that
balances readability and speed. This is primarily accomplished by proper
commenting and consistent code structuring.

Starting in assembly right away would be a bit too insane, so I first wrote a
reference implementation in C using the SDL library, which can be found in the
*reference* directory. I started writing it with the idea that if it was longer
than 150 statements excluding boilerplate, it wouldn't be worth doing it in
assembly. Like all estimates in the world of programming, this limit turned out
to be a gross underestimate, reaching about 134 lines before adding the texture
or even the input code.

After completing the reference code, I wrote the kernel boilerplate code
(setting up VGA, interrupts, etc.) and changed the reference C code to work with
this. Then I began slowly porting everything to handwritten assembly.

Unfortunately this turned out to be a lot more work than I expected, so
currently a large fraction of the codebase is still in C. Slowly porting
everything to assembly is an ongoing process. The code also isn't fully
compatible with all systems yet. It seems to cause floating point exceptions on
some setups.

How to play
-----------

### QEMU

To run the game with QEMU, simply run `make test` This is a quick and easy way
to play around with it.

### Virtual machine

If you want to use virtualization software like VirtualBox, you can produce an
.iso image with `make iso` and mount it. The virtual machine doesn't need a hard
drive and requires no more than 4 MB of RAM.

You can also burn this image to a CD or DVD, but that is rather wasteful. Use
the USB stick method to try it on real hardware unless it really isn't an option
for some reason.

### USB stick

Booting from an USB stick is an excellent way to try it on real hardware, but
does involve a little bit more work. Note that this process will remove all data
currently on the USB stick. Also, make sure to get the drive name right or you
might accidentally wipe your hard drive!

1. Format your USB stick to FAT32 with 1 MB free space preceding.
2. Mount it using `mount /dev/sdx1 /mnt` where `sdx` is the drive name.
3. Turn it into a GRUB rescue disk with `grub-install --no-floppy --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdx`.
4. Run `make iso` and copy the contents of the *iso* directory to the USB stick.
5. Unmount with `umount -l /dev/sdx1`.

Now reboot your PC and boot from USB.

### Debugging with GDB and QEMU

```
qemu-system-i368 -gdb tcp::1234 -S -kernel mineassemble.elf
i686-pc-elf-gdb mineassemble.elf
(gdb) target remote :1234
(gdb) continue
```

Building a cross compiler toolchain
-----------------------------------

In order to build MineAssemble, you need to have a cross compiler toolchain
consisting of the [GNU Binutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) and
[GNU C Compiler](http://gcc.gnu.org/) (GCC).
The toolchain must be built for **i686-pc-elf** target.
For legacy reasons, GNU GCC and Binutils are configured at compile time and
you will need to compile them from source to create a cross compiler
toolchain.
You will also need the NASM Assembler.

In addition, you might need [QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/) for testing
MineAssemble in an emulator and the
[GNU Debugger](http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) (GDB) for debugging.

### Installing prerequisites

You will need to install a handful of utility libraries to build Binutils,
GCC, QEMU and GDB.

Use your operating system's equivalent for apt-get or compile from source.

#### Install [libmpc](http://www.multiprecision.org/), [libgmp](http://gmplib.org/), [libmpfr](http://www.mpfr.org/) (required for binutils, gcc and gdb)

```
sudo apt-get install libmpc-dev libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev
```

#### Install [flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/) and [bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) (required for GCC)

```
sudo apt-get install flex bison
```

#### Install [libsdl](http://www.libsdl.org) (optional front end for qemu)

```
sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev
```

#### Install [NASM](http://www.nasm.us/)

NASM does not need to be configured at compile time, you can install it using your package manager.

```
sudo apt-get install nasm
```

#### Create directories for source, build files and binaries

```
mkdir ~/src                 # Source code
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf-build   # Temporary build files
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf         # Toolchain install destination
```

#### Get source code for Binutils, GCC, QEMU and GDB

```
git clone git://sourceware.org/git/binutils.git ~/src/binutils
git clone git://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git ~/src/gcc
git clone git://git.qemu-project.org/qemu.git ~/src/qemu
git clone git://sourceware.org/git/gdb.git ~/src/gdb
```

#### Check out latest release versions

```
cd ~/src/binutils ; git checkout binutils-2_23_1
cd ~/src/gcc ; git checkout gcc-4_8-branch
cd ~/src/qemu ; git checkout v1.5.0
cd ~/src/gdb ; git checkout gdb_7_6-branch
```

#### Build binutils for target i686-pc-elf

```
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf-build/binutils ; cd ~/i686-pc-elf-build/binutils
~/src/binutils/configure --prefix=$HOME/i686-pc-elf --target=i686-pc-elf --disable-shared --disable-nls
make -j 4  # parallel make for 4 cpus
make install
```

#### Build GCC (C compiler only) for target i686-pc-elf

```
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf-build/gcc ; cd ~/i686-pc-elf-build/gcc
~/src/gcc/configure --prefix=$HOME/i686-pc-elf --target=i686-pc-elf --enable-languages=c --disable-shared --disable-nls
make -j 4 all-gcc
make install-gcc
```

#### Build qemu with i386-softmmu target (with SDL front end)

```
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf-build/qemu ; cd ~/i686-pc-elf-build/qemu
~/src/qemu/configure --prefix=$HOME/i686-pc-elf --target-list=i386-softmmu --enable-sdl
make -j 4
make install
```

#### Build GDB for i686-pc-elf target

```
mkdir ~/i686-pc-elf-build/gdb ; cd ~/i686-pc-elf-build/gdb
~/src/gdb/configure --prefix=$HOME/i686-pc-elf --target=i686-pc-elf
make -j 4
make install
```

#### Add toolchain to $PATH

```
export PATH=$HOME/i686-pc-elf/bin:$PATH
```


Style conventions
-----------------

With something as low-level as assembly, you quickly risk writing unreadable
code if you don't have proper style conventions. This project uses the following
identifier name conventions:

    WORLD_SX - C-style define, usually allowing you to configure things
    worldSX - Non-local variable (local vars are referred to by stack offsets)
    init_world - Subroutine (uses underscores instead of camelCase)
    .main_loop - Local label, only used from within subroutine

Variable names carry no type prefix, because it is almost always very clear what
type a variable uses from its name or usage. Here are some examples:

    float - vectors, angles, distance
    int - time, block coordinates, block normal
    byte - palette color, block type

Directives that apply to segments of a file or the whole file, such as

    [bits 32]
    section .text

have no indentation. Subroutines and local labels have one level of indentation
and code or data within have two levels of indentation. One level of indentation
is equal to 4 spaces.

Code is commonly separated in blocks with a comment above describing what is
done in the block. If a line requires extra explanation, a comment is placed
after the instruction.

Floating point math expressions are systematically converted from the reference
infix expression to RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) to FPU instructions. Any
optimizations are applied afterwards if deemed necessary. This systematic
approach makes converting single-line C expressions to dozens of assembly
instructions bearable and relatively error-free.

Explanation
-----------

The inner workings of this demo are really quite straight-forward. The code can
be divided into four different components.

### World

The world is stored as an *unsigned byte* array where every block has a value of
either `BLOCK_AIR` or `BLOCK_DIRT`. The array is stored in the BSS section and
is initialized by the `init_world` function. It loops over every x, y and z and
creates a world where the lower half is dirt and the upper half is air.

While playing, other code calls `set_block` or `get_block` to interact with
the world. These simply calculate the correct index and write to or read from
the array.

### Input and collision

Keyboard input is collected by an IRQ1 interrupt handler. It writes the up/down
state to a 128-byte array indexed by the [scan code](http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-1.html).
It also sets the upper bit to `1` to mark that key as updated. It ignores a key
down event if the key is already set to down to ignore automatic key repeats.

Because the input handling needs to be independent of performance, an IRQ0
interrupt handler increases a `time` variable by 1 every millisecond to keep
track of time. This is used to compute a delta time to scale movement by.

Before every frame is rendered, the `handle_input` function is called and
collects the values from the `keys` array written to by the interrupt handler.
If the upper bit of a cell is set to `1`, then it knows that the key state has
changed and processes it accordingly. All keys except for the movement keys
(AWSD) are handled here.

After that, the update function is called to move the player according to the
current velocity. This velocity is controlled partly by the `handle_input`
function and partly by checking the down state of the AWSD keys in this
function. The Y velocity is decreased to simulate gravity. Then the next player
position is determined by adding the velocity multiplied by delta time.

Before the new position is assigned, the code first runs the `handle_collision`
function for the head, center of the body and feet. It calls the raytrace
function from these positions with the velocity as direction to determine if
a collision will occur if the player moves to the new position. If that is the
case, the velocity is corrected to *mostly* prevent collision. (The algorithm
is not perfect, but it works pretty well.)

### Rendering

Normally games use rasterization to render and this is very fast. Unfortunately
a graphics library like OpenGL is not available at this level. Instead, code
needs to be written that writes directly to the graphics memory. At this point,
I had two choices: write my own rasterizer or implement a raytracer. I decided
to go with raytracing, because:

- It's much more straight-forward by simply computing the color per pixel
- It's cool, because it allows for easy effects like raytraced shadows
- It's *fast enough*, because we have a uniform 3D grid

The raytrace algorithm computes the distance to reach the sides of the block
the ray starts in for every dimension. The shortest distance wins and the ray
position is moved by that distance times the ray direction. This is repeated
until the position is inside a `BLOCK_DIRT` or if it's out of the world. The
final position is used to compute the side that was hit and the texture
coordinates. The `ray_color` function is then called to let the block decide
what color it's going to output. This function calls the `raytrace` function
again to decide whether the pixel is shadowed or not by using the `sunDir`
direction for the ray. It prevents infinite recursion by requesting an *info*
raytrace instead of a color raytrace. This alternative returns a struct with
hit info instead of a color.

### Resources

One of the details you deal with when using a low-level VGA mode (mode `0x13`)
is that you can't just specify 24-bit or 32-bit RGB color for every pixel.
Instead, you have to decide on a 256 color palette and specify an index for
every pixel. The easy solution here is to use 3-2-3 bit channels and use an RGB
color as index into the palette. Unfortunately this doesn't work at all, because
with only 4 options for the green color channel, there's no way to represent all
the subtle different shades of a grass block.

So I decided to generate a palette that could represent every color that the
textures used exactly, well almost exactly. The palette does allow you to
specify RGB colors, but with only 6 bits per channel instead of 8. That means
that colors will be slightly off, but this is pretty much unnoticeable.

I wrote a program in C# that took the grass, dirt and side textures along with
the reserved colors black, white and sky and automatically generated a palette
and a palette colored representation of the three textures. This ended up
working perfectly!

The splash screen works slightly differently. The reason that it's a bitmap
instead of just using text mode is to make things a bit more streamlined. I
first tried encoding it the same way as the textures, but this resulted in a
6400 line C file. Then I changed it to simply write a string of 1's and 0's for
every line, which works much better. It even allows you to view the splash
screen using a text editor! :-)

The bitmap of the splash screen is copied directly to VGA memory where `'0'` is
subtracted from every byte. The `keys` array is then checked for an ENTER key
press before the game is loaded. A problem here is that the user has to press
ENTER in the GRUB bootloader menu as well, which means it would skip the splash
screen immediately. That problem is currently solved by waiting for an ENTER key
press twice. Somehow this even works when booting with Ctrl-X or another
combination.

351,VazkiiMods/Botania,Java,"![](web/assets/img/logo.png)  
Welcome to the Botania repository.  

Botania is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) tech mod themed around natural magic. It's inspired by other magic mods, such as [Thaumcraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thaumcraft) or [Blood Magic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blood-magic).  

The current iteration of Botania is made possible thanks to the massive help by the part of [williewillus](https://github.com/williewillus), who ported the mod from 1.8 through to the present day, so go buy him a beer or something, I dunno, he's pretty cool.

Botania is licensed under the [Botania License](http://botaniamod.net/license.php)

For information on contributing, please read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Maven info

Maven artifacts are located [here](https://maven.blamejared.com/vazkii/botania/Botania/), each folder representing a version.

Note: As of 1.16, intermediate (non-release) Maven builds are no longer persisted.
That is, you must either depend on a *released* version of Botania, e.g. `1.16.2-407`, or specifically opt in to the bleeding-edge
build of the next version. For example, `1.16.2-408-SNAPSHOT` would be the current bleeding edge version of future version `1.16.2-408`. 

Note that `-SNAPSHOT` versions can be broken from time to time, and you are strongly discouraged from using them unless you are helping dogfood, test, or contribute to Botania. They may also be pruned from time to time to save disk space on the server. Do *not* rely on `-SNAPSHOT` versions for anything important!

In Forge, add the following to your `build.gradle`
```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://maven.blamejared.com' }
}

dependencies {
    // 1.14+
    compileOnly fg.deobf(""vazkii.botania:Botania:[VERSION]:api"")
    runtimeOnly fg.deobf(""vazkii.botania:Botania:[VERSION]"")
}
```
## Mixin Troubleshooting

Read this if you get crashes when depending on Botania and trying to launch in-dev.
Botania uses Mixins to implement various features.
This may cause issues when depending on Botania in-dev, since ForgeGradle/MixinGradle
do not yet properly support this in-dev like Fabric does.
As a workaround, disable refmaps by defining the `mixin.env.disableRefMap`
JVM argument to `true`.

If you use Eclipse, run `gradlew eclipse` to generate an Eclipse project,
then use `File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace` inside
Eclipse. Navigate to the EnchantmentCracker folder and click import.

If you use IntelliJ IDEA, it can import the Gradle project directly.

Most contributions are accepted via
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

If you want to add translations to the project, you are welcome to do so!
You do this by adding a new `.properties` file under `resources/i18n`
representing your added language, then create a pull request adding that file.
As creating a pull request may be tricky if you are not used to coding,
translators may instead create an issue and upload their properties file, and
I will add it in myself.

Note that if you do make translations, I will not be able to update most of them in line
with the default English translations, as I do not speak those languages, so you may have
to keep them updated yourself.

This repo deploys [itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server) as [Azure Container Instance](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/), using Terraform.

![alt text](./visuals/diagram.png ""Diagram"")

## Instructions
There are 2 ways to set this up:

### Codespace setup
The easiest method is to use a GitHub [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (in beta). Just create a GitHub Codespace from the Code menu. Wait for the Codespace to complete provisioning. When the Codespace has completed provisioning and you open a terminal window (Ctrl-`, Control-backquote), you should see a message like this:
```
To provision infrastructure, make sure you're logged in with Azure CLI e.g. run 'az login' and 'az account set --subscription 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'. Then, either:
 - change to the /home/codespace/workspace/azure-minecraft-docker/terraform directory and run 'terraform apply', or:
 - run /home/codespace/workspace/azure-minecraft-docker/scripts/deploy.ps1 -apply
To destroy infrastructure, replace 'apply' with 'destroy' in above commands
```
Just follow these steps to provision Minecraft on Azure.
### Local setup
If you set this up locally, make sure you have the following pre-requisites:
- [Azure CLI](http://aka.ms/azure-cli)
- [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (to get that you can use [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) on Linux & macOS, [Homebrew](https://github.com/hashicorp/homebrew-tap) on macOS or [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/terraform) on Windows)

On macOS, you can run `brew bundle` to install the pre-requisites.

Once you have those, you can go ahead and provision:
- Use Azure CLI for SSO with [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/azure_cli): `az login`
- Select subscription to use: `az account set --subscription 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
- Initialize terraform: `terraform init`
- Provision cloud infrastructure: `terraform apply`

### Customization
You can customize the deployment by overriding defaults for Terraform [input variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html). The easiest way to do this is to copy [config.auto.example.tfvars](./terraform/config.auto.example.tfvars) and save it as config.auto.tfvars.
- Use the `minecraft_users` array to define users allowed to log in
- Use a custom DNS name with `vanity_dns_zone_id` and `vanity_hostname_prefix`, using an Azure DNS managed domain
- Once things get serious, you may want to start backing up data with `enable_backup`
- Are your kids home schooling on the same computer that has Minecraft installed? Configure auto shutdown & startup during weekdays with `enable_auto_startstop`, `start_time` & `stop_time`. The Logic App triggers created can be favorited in the [mobile app](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/mobile-app/) for on-demand startup & shutdown.
- Concerned about chat messages appearing in logs? `enable_log_filter` uses the [Console Spam Fix](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/console-spam-fix) and [configures](./minecraft/log-filter/config.yml) it to hide chat messages from logs. This feature is dependent on [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) and is more brittle in automation, but satisfies a key privacy requirement.

See [variables.tf](./terraform/variables.tf) for all input variables.
## Dashboard
Once provisioned, a dashboard like this will be available in the Azure Portal:   

![alt text](./visuals/dashboard.png ""Dashboard"")
You can update the dashboard in the portal and re-generate the [template](./terraform/dashboard.tpl) using [templatize_dashboard.ps1](./scripts/templatize_dashboard.ps1).

how to build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KosmX/emotes.git
cd emotes
./gradlew build
```
You can use `collectArtifacts` task to copy the mod files into an artifacts directory.  
```bash
./gradlew collectArtifact
cd artifacts
```
  
### Using in your mod/modpack  

`Fabric` depends on [**bendy-lib**](https://github.com/KosmX/bendy-lib), optionally [**Mod Menu**](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu)   and FabricMC mods: **Fabric-loader**, **Fabric-API**, **Minecraft**.  


`Forge` version has no dependencies (except **Forge** and **Minecraft**)  
**bendy-lib** is compiled into the forge version  

### Emotes proxy
Emotecraft is doing the emote synchronization using a server-side mod.  
In some cases it's just impossible (like when playing on a community server)
   
This is where proxy API comes in as it can redirect communication when dedicated server-side mod isn't available.  
If the server has Emotecraft (in any form) it will use that instead of using proxies.  

To implement a proxy-mod, see [emotes-proxy-template](https://github.com/KosmX/emotes-proxy-template).  
Emotecraft will invoke the proxy instance when trying to send a message,  
and you can invoke Emotecraft's receiver when you received a message. 


Modules:
--------
`emotesAPI`: common library used by Emotecraft, has no dependencies, published as **emotesAPI**  
    you can find it in my private maven server: [`https://maven.kosmx.dev`](https://maven.kosmx.dev)  
`executor`: the interface to be implemented to the modloader+MC version  
`emotesMain`: Main client-side logic    
`emotesServer`: Server-side logic    
<br>
`archCommon`: common (both Fabric and Forge) Minecraft dependent stuff. using [architectury](https://github.com/architectury/forgified-fabric-loom) loom  
`fabric`: latest fabric implementation  
`forge`: latest Forge implementation

359,ConnorGraham/Minecraft-Nintendo-Switch-Private-Server,HTML,"# Minecraft-Nintendo-Switch

Minecraft for Nintendo Switch doesn't allow connecting to Bedrock servers via IP. It only allows multiplayer by connecting to 1 of 5 pre-whitelsted public servers. Using docker, this repo contains everything necessary to connect your Nintendo Switch to your own private (or any other dedicated) server.

The basic premise is when your switch tries to connect to the Lifeboat Network, it is connecting to mco.lsbg.net. By running a local DNS service (bind9) and pointing the Switch to use your DNS service allows you to intercept the request to mco.lsbg.net and resolve it against your private (or any other dedicated) server's IP address

## Pre-requisites
1. Docker and Docker Compose
2. A static ip address for your machine running DNS
3. IP address of Minecraft BDS server

## Steps to run
1. Clone this repo
2. Edit dns/data/bind/etc/zones/db.mco.lbsg.net and replace 192.168.0.69 with the IP address of Minecraft server
3. (optional) If you want to run your own server, go to /minecraft and run 
```
docker-compose up
``` 
4. In a separate window, Run DNS by goinge to /dns and run
```
docker-compose up
```
5. Lastly, in your Nintendo Switch network settings, set the primary DNS server to the private IP address of your machine running DNS
6. Open Minecraft, go to the realms tab and connect to Lifeboat Network. You should be connecting to your private server instead!

## Information 
Blaze4D is a Fabric mod that changes Minecraft's rendering engine to use the Vulkan Graphics Library, it is currently in
Early Development and is **NOT** intended for use by the faint-hearted. Support for Blaze4D can be found in the #support
Discord channel.

## Community
We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/H93wJePuWf) where you can track development progress, ask questions, or just hang out in.

## Building
### Build Requirements

 - Vulkan SDK - Version 1.3.208 or newer
 - CMake and a C++ compiler - Required for building some of our dependencies
 - Rust - Version 1.62.0 or newer
 - Java 18

### Build Steps
To build the project with natives for your platform run
```
./gradlew build
```
in the project root directory.

To run the game with the mod use any of the 3 run targets:
- `./gradlew runClient`
- `./gradlew runClientWithValidation` - Enables validation layers
- `./gradlew runClientWithValidationRenderdoc` - Enables validation layers and automatically loads the renderdoc shared library.

#### Manually building natives
To work on and test natives it can be useful to run cargo manually. To do this it's necessary to first build the assets
by running
```
./gradlew :core:assets:build
```
This only needs to be repeated if the assets are modified.

After that the natives can be manually built using cargo.

## Contributing
1. Clone the repository (https://github.com/Blaze4D-MC/Blaze4D.git).
2. Edit
3. Pull Request

## Project Structure
The project is organized in 2 parts

### Core
This is the core of Blaze4D that performs the actual rendering and is written in Rust. The gradle project contains 3
subprojects.
 - assets - These are any assets we need to bundle with Blaze4D. For example shaders or fonts. They currently need to be separately built after a change using their gradle `build` task.
 - natives - The main Blaze4D core rust code.
 - api - A java api of the rust code used by the mod.

### Mod
This is the fabric mod itself. Its job is to interface with minecraft. Most of the heavy lifting should take place in Blaze4D core."

368,bleroy/minecraft.client,C#,"Decent .NET Minecraft Client
============================

A .NET client library for the original (Java) version of Minecraft.
It requires Forge and the Raspberry Jam mod on the Minecraft side.

How to use it
-------------

Requirements: Minecraft (the Java version, not the micro edition or the Windows 10 edition),
[Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), and the [Raspberry Jam Mod](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod/releases)].

Reference the library, then you can open a connection and start scripting the Minecraft
world:

```csharp
using (var world = JavaWorld.Connect())
{
    world.PostToChat(""Hello from C# and .NET Core!"");
    var originBlock = world.GetBlockType(0, 0, 0);
    world.PostToChat($""Origin block is {originBlock}."");
}
```

![Scripting Minecraft from C#](decent.minecraft.png)

Status
------

This is just a hack at this point: only a minimal number of APIs is implemented,
but the general infrastructure is in place, and the code can actually script Minecraft
from C#, which is pretty awesome in itself.

How does it work?
-----------------

There's [a Minecraft mod that enables scripting Minecraft in Python called Raspberry Jam
Mod](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod/releases).
The way that mod works is with a small Java mod that lives in Minecraft, accepting socket
connections from a Python client and then exchanging text-based messages that on the wire
look like function calls:

```
world.getBlock(1,0,0)
```

The interesting thing is that there is nothing specific about Python in that protocol:
it's just messages getting exchanged over a socket, which .NET will be happy to emulate.

What I did is to reverse-engineer the Python client code and re-implement it in C#.

Where is this going?
--------------------

Eventually, I'd like to expose the entire Minecraft API with a nice object model,
and to be able to start the C# scripts from the Minecraft console.
That would effectively make it possible to write mods in C#, with a thin Java driver.

CSX support would be nice as well.

I also want to be able to run this with Mono (that should actually already work,
this is just .NET Standard) on a Raspberry Pi: the protocol that Raspberry Jam implements
is natively present on the Raspberry Pi version.

Building from source
--------------------

The project must now be built with [csproj-based tooling (Visual Studio 2017 with Core tooling or .NET Core CLI Preview 3 or later)](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core).

Can I help? - Up for grabs
--------------------------

Sure. Just let me know what you'd like to work on, so we don't duplicate efforts, but yes,
hacking is highly encouraged.

### Blocks

This is an easy contribution.

There's a couple hundred blocks to implement. Some of them, such as `Diamond`, are very simple,
and some are a little more complex, such as `Fire`.
In some cases, such as `Clay`, a class hierarchy makes sense.

If you're interested in implementing blocks, look at the existing blocks in the `Blocks` folder,
then choose one from the `BlockType` enum that doesn't exist yet and implement it.
A block is a class that derives from `Block`.
In the simplest case, the class is empty:

```csharp
public class Diamond : IBlock {}
```

The block class is only part of the implementation, that is supposed to be a simple data structure
with no knowledge of the communication protocol with Minecraft.
The code that does know about the protocol must be implemented in `JavaBlock`, in the `JavaBlock`
static constructor, and in the `public static JavaBlock From(Block block)` method.

The static constructor describes how to instantiate the correct block type from data that was
passed in. In simple cases, there is no data, and no need to implement construction logic.

When blocks have data, the block contruction logic must build the correct block from the wire data:

```csharp
_ctors[Id<Farmland>()] = d => new Farmland(d);
```

In more complex cases, the data must be decomposed and the corresponding properties must be set
on the block object.

The reverse operation implemented in the `From` method is recreating a `JavaBlock` ready to be
transmitted to Minecraft from a concrete block.
If the block you're implementing has no data, nothing has to be implemented, and this part can be
skipped.

The description of the format of the data for each block type that has data can be found in The
[Minecraft documentation wiki Data values page](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_values).

### Entities

Entities will be an easy contribution once I've started creating the basic infrastructure.

### Tests

This is an easy to medium contribution.

There are lots of blocks that need testing of their serialization and deserialization logic. We also need tests for infrastructure pieces such as `JavaWorld`. Finally, we'll ultimately need functional tests.

### Commands

This is a medium difficulty contribution.

Very few commands are currently implemented: you can echo messages to the chat using `PostToChat`,
you can get the position of the player using `Player.GetPosition`, and you can get or set a block using
`GetBlock` and `SetBlock`.
Many more commands need to be implemented.
You can find the list of commands and their Python implementation [in the Raspberry Jam Mod GitHub repository](https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod/blob/master/mcpipy/mcpi/minecraft.py).
Make sure you implement both an asynchronous and a synchronous version of each method.
Finally, once you've implemented a command, don't forget to add it to the `IWorld` interface.

### New protocols

This is a difficult contribution.

Currently, this library can only talk to the Java implementation of Minecraft, and to the Raspberry
Pi version (hopefully, I haven't verified it yet).
The code is architected so that it should be possible to implement alternative protocols by
reimplementing `JavaConnection`, `JavaWorld`, and `JavaBlock`.
This way, a single API could in theory be used to script other versions of the Minecraft client and
of Minecraft servers.

Tips and tricks
---------------

It is useful, while developing scripts, to be able to switch to another application without the game going into pause. This can be done by editing the `options.txt` file under your Minecraft folder (`%appdata%\.minecraft\` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/` on macOS, and `~/.minecraft/` on Linux) and setting `pauseOnLostFocus` to `false`."
369,microsoft/MinecraftCodex,TypeScript,"# Codex for Minecraft NPCs

This prototype uses GPT-3 Codex to power a Non-Player Character (NPC) in Minecraft. Through the discipline of ""prompt engineering"" (see section below), we show the model how to use the Minecraft SimulatedPlayer API to write code to navigate the world, mine, craft and even carry on conversation.

![Minecraft Codex gif](minecraft-codex.gif)

## Requirements

Please read the readme carefully to make sure you get the right bits. This repo works with very specific versions of Minecraft, Minecraft dedicated server, and Node, and requires setup commands to be called in specific order.

- An [OpenAI account](https://openai.com/api/)

  - [OpenAI API Key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).
  - [OpenAI Organization Id](https://beta.openai.com/account/org-settings). If you have multiple organizations, please update your [default organization](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the one that has access to codex engines before getting the organization Id.
  - [OpenAI Engine Id](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/codex-series-private-beta). The name of the Codex model you're using. This repository was primarily tested using `code-davinci-002`. See [here](#what-openai-engines-are-available-to-me) for checking available engines.

- You need to be an owner of Minecraft, or have PC GamePass, in order to use Minecraft or Minecraft Preview.
  - This sample uses a separate Dedicated Server and a Minecraft client app. For more information on Minecraft Bedrock Edition, Dedicated Server and how you can use scripting with them, see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/minecraft/creator/documents/scriptingservers).
  - This build uses the latest Minecraft version (version 1.19.0 or higher). You will need a version of Minecraft Dedicated Server, downloadable from https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock, and Minecraft client version 1.19.0 or higher, which the below links will help you to gather.
  - Note that Minecraft has both main and ""Preview"" versions of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. You can now use the main Minecraft editions to use this sample; you no longer need to use the Minecraft Preview app with this sample in particular.
  - You can access Minecraft from the MS Store here to make sure you have access: `https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PGW18NPBZV5`
  - Download the Xbox app from Microsoft Store, and sign in with your consumer MSA account (same thing as your Xbox account if you have one) `https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MV0B5HZVK9Z`
  - Open the Xbox App to install Minecraft `(https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P5X4QVLC2XR)`.
    - LTS 16.15 version of [Node.JS]`(https://nodejs.org/en/)`
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - OPTIONAL: Clear chat texture pack to make it easier to see the bot actions without the dim screen of chat. Download from here and follow install directions: `https://mcpedl.com/clear-chat-tranparent-chat/`

## Setup

1. Clone the repo wherever you like: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/MinecraftCodex.git`. The project is setup to work with your local Minecraft install.
1. Open the folder you placed the repo in locally in VSCode
1. You will get a recommendations to install Minecraft extensions to enable debugging, you want to accept those
1. Open Terminal in VSCode in the code directory, and run `npm install` to pull down the package dependencies.
1. Under the scripts folder, create a file called `vars.ts` with the following key value pairs:
   ```
   export let OPENAI_API_KEY = ""<YOUR_KEY_HERE>"";
   export let OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID = ""<YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE>"";
   export let OPENAI_ENGINE_ID = ""<YOUR_CODEX_MODEL_NAME_HERE>"";
   export let DEBUG = false;
   ```
1. Place your OpenAI API key between the quotes, and save the file.

## Install Minecraft Bedrock Edition Dedicated Server

1. Download and unzip the Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server to a location on your hard drive.
1. In the Minecraft Codex code directory, open `gulpfile.js` and update the `dedicatedServerPath` variable to the folder where your dedicated server is located. Note: it must end with a '\\' character
1. You will likely need to disable PowerShell signing requirements for the session. In the VSCode Terminal type: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` You will need to do this every time you open a new terminal, or restart VSCode. It only works on the current process, so nowhere else should this take effect.
1. Run these three commandsin the VSCode terminal, which should be in the repo folder.
   `gulp updateconfig`
   `gulp updateserver`
   `gulp updateworld`
1. Those commands will:

   - Add additional configuration files that enable this module to make net requests on Dedicated Server.
   - Update server configuration properties (`server.properties`)
   - Reset the Minecraft Dedicated Server to the default world for the Codex World.

1. The first time you run Bedrock Dedicated Server, you may see a prompt within Windows to enable ports on your firewall for public and/or private networks.
   Within the pop up Firewall prompt in Windows that you may receive, you will want to potentially enable Bedrock Server port access on your Private networks.
   Alternately, ensure at least ports 19132 and 19133 are open to Bedrock Dedicated Server via your Firewall tools.
1. Ensure that local Minecraft local clients can connect to your locally-hosted server - to do this, you need to enable 'loopback' connections for Minecraft UWP.

   To enable loopback for Minecraft on Windows, run:

   ```dotnetcli
   npm run enablemcloopback
   ```

   To enable loopback for Minecraft Preview on Windows, run:

   ```dotnetcli
   npm run enablemcpreviewloopback
   ```

1. To run the game server with proper configs and defaults, you need to use `gulp serve` from your code directory, typically from the VSCode terminal.
1. Run the dedicated server from it's directory once to get it up and running. After it has completed loading (you will see the message ""Debugger Listening"" on the console), type in the following command to ensure you have full access to controls in game.
   `op <your username>`

## Building and Deploying

1. To have it continuously re-build as you make changes, run `gulp watch`. This will stop the server and restart it with your latest code regularly.
1. The deployment step automatically moves the compiled code to a Minecraft Behavior Pack folder within your Dedicated Server.

## Connecting to the Dedicated Server

1. Open your Minecraft client and click Play. Select ""Servers"".
   The first time you play, you will need to add a server:
1. Scroll all the way down on the left side to and select Add Server
1. Type a name for the server (""local"") and use a Server Address of 127.0.0.1 if you are running Dedicated Server on the same machine.
1. Select the server, and select Join Server.

1. Open the chat (click 't') and type `/gametest run codex:codex` to spawn the Non-Player Character, along with a test structure from the BehaviorPack. When loading your world in the future, you can push the button on the command block that appears in the test structure to start the codex code running

## Debugging

Use the following steps to debug:

1. Make sure you have the Minecraft Bedrock Edition Debugger installed within Visual Studio Code, or this won't work properly, make sure it is version 0.2.0 or later
2. Running `gulp serve` in your code folder will start the server running, and then you can run the debugger from VSCode which will automatically connect to the server.
3. You can set breakpoints in the TypeScript files directly. NOTE: The code in CodexBot is not hitting breakpoints correctly, this is a known error and being looked at.

## Interacting with the NPC

Now that you've spawned the NPC into the game, you can have a multi-turn conversation with it!

1. Click 't' to open the chat and send messages to the NPC. If you interact conversationally (e.g. ""What are you up to?"" or ""What's the meaning of life?), the NPC should respond with natural language. If given a command (e.g. ""look at me"", ""move forward a bit"", etc.) the NPC should respond with code and evaluate it.
1. The NPC is able to carry-on multi-turn conversations, carrying context across conversation turns. Example:

```
Player: What's your favorite Minecraft resource'
NPC: bot.chat(""I love oak logs!"")
Player: ""Why's that?
NPC: bot.chat(""Because they're so versatile!"")
```

**Note**: The NPC isn't perfect, and sometimes the conversation can get stuck or begin repeating itself. Type ""reset"" to reset the conversational experience.

## How it Works - Prompt Engineering

The Codex model being used in this sample has never seen the SimulatedPlayer API we're asking it to use (it's a new API that wasn't in its training set). In order to get the model to use the SimulatedPlayer API, we need to engineer prompts that give the model examples of the kinds of commands it will receive and the kind of code it should write. From just a few Natual Language to Code examples, we can use the model to generate new code from new commands.

We coax the correct code and natural language out of Codex through a discipline called prompt engineering. Large Language Models like GPT-3 and Codex are trained to guess the next word in a sentence, or more generally, the next token in a sequence. They can do this continuously to genereate whole sentences, paragraphs, lines of code and functions. To coax very specific code out of the models, it's best to give prompts that convey our intent and give examples of what we're looking for.

Please note: The NPC capabilities are limited to abilities in the capabilities of the SimulatedPlayer API, along with some extra capabilities we gave it. It can walk, chat with you, walk around, look at you, follow you, mine blocks, and craft items (etc.) It can't currently use visual cues about the world around it or handle capabilities outside of the API spec. You can code new behaviors yourself and alter the prompts to enable the bot to do what you would like, and we encourage you to do so!

In the `codexPrompt` folder, you'll find the prompts used to give the model examples. You'll notice that the prompts have some general context, and are modelled as a series of comments (natural language) and code:

```js
//Minecraft bot commands, using the SimulatedPlayer library. When the comment is conversational, the bot will respond as a helpful minecraft bot. Otherwise, it will do as asked.

// Look at me
bot.lookAtEntity();

// Do that continuously
state.lookingInterval = setInterval(bot.lookAtEntity, 50);

// Stop!
state.clearInterval(state.lookingInterval);

// What's your name?
bot.chat(""My name is "" + bot.username);
```

These interactions serve as examples to the model of what the SimulatedPlayer API looks like, and also to suggest the kind of code that Codex should write. When a player calls the model with another command (e.g. ""How are you?""), we append that command onto the prompt as another comment, and ask the model to generate the next chunk of code:

```js
... examples
// What's your name?
bot.chat(""My name is "" + bot.username);

// How are you?
```

Given the examples above, it will correctly guess that the code it writes should use the `bot.chat` API, to answer something like `bot.chat(""I'm doing just fine!"")`.

As interactions (NL -> Code) continue, we continue appending them onto the prompt to maintain context on future turns. This allows Codex to resolve pronouns and understand past context when asked to do something new (e.g. know that ""that"" is looking at a player when they say ""stop doing that"").

## How it Works - Evaluating Code

Prompt engineering allows Codex to frequently produce novel code - the next step is to run that code. This is done by evaluating it. In languages like Python and JavaScript (which don't require code to be compiled), it's possible to directly evaluate a string of code using an eval function (e.g. `eval(codeString)`). Somewhat counterintuitively, the code evaluation in this sample isn't happening from the bot's side, but rather from the game - see the `evaluateCode` function in `scripts/CodexGame` to see how we use `eval` to evaluate the code we get back from the model.

## How it Works - API Design

This sample gives Codex the prompts to use the [SimulatedPlayer API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/mojang-gametest/simulatedplayer) and our extensions of the API when it generates code. Our extensions of the API give Codex several more capabilities to enable the NPC to handle more behaviors. We did this to enable higher-level code generation, giving the NPC the primitives it needs to accomplish more complex behaviors. As an example, you wouldn't want a model to use primitive movement functions (move left, move right, etc.) to navigate from point A to point B - this might require the model to write hundreds of lines of code. Instead, you may consider authoring a function that abstracts this kind of navigation away (e.g. `bot.extendedNavTo(position)`) that the model can then invoke.

Also important in designing an API is having consistent naming conventions and limiting the namespaces in which the model is expected to write code. Like a developer, the model will more effectively used a well-abstacted, consistently named API. We have added our own APIs as fronts to SimulatedPlayer in order to enable this consistency.

## Extending NPC Capabilities

You can extend the abilities of this NPC by building your own prompts, adding more examples of the kinds of code you expect the model to write. If you want to implement entirely new behaviors (e.g. attacking mobs), you may need to extend the API with new functions (e.g. a function called `attackEntity(entity)`).

## A Note on Fine Tuning

This example shows how we can enable Codex to generate a specific API's code by example, through prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is often a good place to start when assessing a Large Language Model's ability to generate language and code. Prompt engineering has limits though - prompts can only be so large, model performance worsens as more concepts are introduced, and larger prompts take longer to process and use more compute resources.

To improve a Large Language model's ability to understand a specific domain, you can fine tune a model - effectively re-training it with a corpus of code, example interactions, documentation and other context. In the case of the Minecraft bot, we could significantly improve the bot's abilities by fine-tuning a model with the entire SimulatedPlayer API documentation, examples of interactions between players and the NPC, information about Minecraft, and more.

## Important Info on the GameTest APIs

GameTest is a beta API from the Minecraft team, and is subject to change with updates. We will work to keep this repo up to date with new releases. The documentation is currently being written, so there are a few things to be aware of, as noted in the next section.

## Important Tips

- If you edit the manifest.json file, ignore any warnings it gives you about the existing file
- Also, if you edit the manifest.json file, do not change the first two entries in dependencies, these are required
- If there is an error in your test being registered, (like you didn't import GameTest), you won't get any notification of what is wrong
- So make sure you can verify your entry point is working before you do a lot of crazy work (like I did). The best way to do this is to type the following into the console:

`/gametest run [your class]::[yourtestname]`

If you don't see the console trying to autocomplete to your test, then you have a problem with your entry point.

## Code Structure

1. main.ts is where the code pack is registered and we pass in the tickMain function to run every game tick (20 times per second)
2. tickMain calls into an instance of CodexGame, which handles the game logic, creates the CodexBot, and manages state logic for the bot
3. CodexGame is also where we call `eval()` to run the generated code.
4. CodexBot is a wrapper around the SimulatedPlayer class from Minecraft, which handles the bot's logic
5. Crafting class is a static class that manages a database of recipes and will remove items from the bot and return to it the item if it can craft the item. It's not a true ""crafting"" function so you can alter it to not remove items from the bot, or to give the bot exactly what it needs to craft, or even just give the bot the item you want it to have directly.
6. The prompt class manages the text input to Codex that informs it of how we expect input to be delivered. In this case, we are using the .\prompts\combinedPrompts.ts file.
7. TimedQueue is a class to manage promise chaining with wait functions to create complex behaviors
8. The GameTest APIs can be viewed in the node_modules/@types folder. They are mojang-gametest, mojang-minecraft and mojang-net. mojang-net is included with the source depot and copied into the node_modules folder. The others are npm packages.
9. The .vscode json files include info on which code modules we are importing from Minecraft, and request download of the required extensions for VSCode
10. The actions taken by gulp are managed by the gulpfile.js file. It transpiles the Typescript to Javascript, and copies the files to the correct locations.
11. All functions that are act on or are part of SimulatedPlayer are relative to a zero point of where the GameTest structure manifests. You will see code in CodexBot that ensures positions are updated correctly.
12. The location you read out of SimulatedPlayer is a world location, and is NOT relative to anything
13. There are two location types: BlockLocation and Location. You will find yourself having to convert back and forth dependin on the types the functions are requesting
14. Properties of most GameTest objects can be queried through getComponent() and passing in a string value. You can enumerate the components through getComponents() on the same object.

372,vram-guild/canvas,Java,"# Canvas
Canvas is a shader-based Renderer for the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) modding toolchain.  It supports all features of the proposed [Fabric Rendering API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/pull/65) plus extensions defined in [FREX](https://github.com/grondag/frex).

Discord: https://discord.gg/7NaqR2e
Curse: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer

## License
Except as noted in individual source files, all code in this mod, include shaders, is [licensed under the LGPL-3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html). This means no warranty is provided.

Some elements of code are adapted from or copied from other projects with compatible licensing.  The author has attempted to provide credit and/or appropriate notices in the code where applicable.

## Limitations
Canvas is in EARLY ALPHA.  Expect it to break.

The FREX extensions, shader library, vertex formats, attribute bindings, and lighting options are subject to change - causing your code to break.  Sorry.  When there is a stable release I will avoid breaking changes in shipping versions.  Until then, experimentation is the norm.

## Why
When people first hear about Canvas they often ask if it is a performance mod or a replacement for Optifine / shader packs.  The answer is ""no, but...""

Optifine and shader packs primarily target vanilla Minecraft.  They work with modded, often well, but they aren't designed as tools for *mod authors*.

Canvas' main purpose is to give mod authors more control and options for rendering modded blocks.  It can also be used for building shader packs, but the design is entirely different than OF and does not yet support all the features needed for a full shader pack implementation.  Unlike OF shader packs, Canvas shader packs can be mixed together by adding multiple resource packs. 

## Performance
Performance-wise, Canvas tries to be be faster than Vanilla with extended features. It is optimized heavily - but the intent of these changes is to make better rendering practical, not to be a general-purpose performance mod. It isn't meant to run on low-end hardware and may or may not make your game run faster overall.

Canvas will try to fully use your hardware and will not be timid about it. It wants at least 4GB and will push both your CPU and GPU.  It will stress your cooling system.

If you're looking to max performance with Canvas, the config menu tool tips indicate which features can help.  Bloom is especially expensive at high resolutions.  But bloom is also fun to look at, so.... your call. 

More optimizations will be added after a stable release.

# Using Canvas

## Installing Canvas
Add Canvas to the `mods` folder in your minecraft folder (`%appdata%/.minecraft/mods` on Windows) and make sure you have recent versions of [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) Loader and API, plus at least 4GB of memory allocated to Minecraft.  An in-game config menu is available in video options, or via Mod Menu if you have it installed.

## Compatible Shader Packs

Third-party pipeline shaders:
* [Lumi Lights](https://spiralhalo.github.io/)
* [Forget-me-not](https://github.com/Poisoned-Honey/ForgetMeNot-Shaders)
* [lomo (wip)](https://github.com/fewizz/lomo/)

This list is updated infrequently.

More releases can be found in [`#canvas-3rd-party-releases` channel](https://discord.com/channels/614624415631671316/752632870257950790) on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/7NaqR2e).

# Developing With Canvas
Before using Canvas, you should first understand RenderMaterials, Meshes, RenderContexts and other features defined by the Fabric Rendering API.  For that information, consult the [rendering article on the Fabric Wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/rendering). Note: Fabric wiki is still WIP as of this writing but should be more complete ""soon.""

You can also see [RenderBender](https://github.com/grondag/renderbender) for some (not very good) examples of usage.  Avoid duplicating those examples directly - they aren't especially performant or suitable for use at scale.  As soon as someone releases a model loader / library for Fabric Rendering API / FREX, that will almost certainly be a better approach.

## Attaching Shaders to Materials

Shaders can be attached to materials via json, which is the preferred way. Your materials are located in `materials/` within your namespaced resource location.

### assets/example/materials/test_material.json
```json
{
	""vertexSource"": ""example:shaders/test.vert"",
	""fragmentSource"": ""example:shaders/test.frag""
}
```

The paths in `vertexSource` and `fragmentSource` should point to GLSL files in your resources location.  The relative path and file extension must be included, and `shaders/` is the suggested location but not mandatory.

Afterwards, you can map a blockstate (or entity, particle, etc) to your material using a material map located in `materialmaps/`, like so:

### assets/example/materialmaps/block/test_block.json
```json
{
  ""defaultMaterial"": ""example:test_material""
}
```

You can also load the material directly into java

```java
Renderer renderer = Renderer.get();

// obtain the loaded material, done after resource reload
RenderMaterial mat = renderer.materials().materialFromId(new ResourceLocation(""example:test_material""));
```

Note that loading materials directly is only necessary for rendering custom meshes. For full blocks, entities, particles, or fluids, using material maps is the recommended way.

Alternatively, materials can also be created directly in java, like so:

```java
Renderer renderer = Renderer.get();

RenderMaterial mat = renderer.materials().materialFinder().shader(
		new ResourceLocation(""example"", ""shaders/test.vert""),
		new ResourceLocation(""example"", ""shaders/test.frag"")
	).find();
```

This can be more reliable in case you don't want your materials to be affected by resource packs or resource reload. In this case, material maps can't be utilized.

## Writing Material Shaders

Your vertex and fragment shaders must have a `frx_materialVertex` and `frx_materialFragment` procedures respectively. To ensure compatibility, shaders are limited to `#version 330` features.

A detailed documentation of the available API can be found in the FREX source files:
* [FREX Shader API Overview](https://github.com/vram-guild/frex/blob/1.18/common/src/main/resources/assets/frex/shaders/api/FREX%20Shader%20API.md)
* [ FREX Shader API Header Files](https://github.com/vram-guild/frex/tree/1.18/common/src/main/resources/assets/frex/shaders/api)

## Adding Canvas to your project
Add these maven repos to your build if not already present

```gradle
repositories {
	// vram guild repo
	maven {url ""https://maven.vram.io""}
	// cloth config / used by canvas dependencies
	maven {url ""https://maven.shedaniel.me/""}
	// spruce ui / current ui library
	maven {url ""https://maven.gegy.dev""}
	// mod menu
	maven {url ""https://maven.terraformersmc.com/releases/""}
}
```

And add Canvas to your dependencies

```gradle
dependencies {
	modCompileOnly ""io.vram:canvas-fabric-mc118:1.0.+""

	// optional for testing in dev environment
	modRuntimeOnly ""io.vram:canvas-fabric-mc118:1.0.+""
}
```

Note that versions are subject to change - look at the repo to find latest.

## Why aren't there many API additions?

(Modified from [starlis/empirecraft](https://github.com/starlis/empirecraft/))
<p>
APIs are tough to design. In projects such as Bukkit, Spigot, Sponge, Paper, etc once an API is committed, it's almost forever. You can't go breaking it without solid justification. This is the politics game.

With that in mind, much thought has to be given to the API in now and future use cases and applications to ensure it can be extended without breaking.

This is a lot of politics that we don't have time in our lives to deal with. 

That being said we make light API additions when requested.

Minecraft@Home BOINC
====================

## Volunteer your compute resources

You can volunteer your compute resources to help with our research, BOINC will use your computer when you're not to run applications which further our research.

[Click here to join!](https://minecraftathome.com/minecrafthome/signup.php)

## Development

The [Minecraft@Home](https://minecraftathome.com) server is a set of [Docker](https://docker.com) containers which together create a [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/) environment to allow the public to volunteer compute resources for use with Minecraft research projects.

Using a few commands, anyone can check out this code and run a local version of the Minecraft@Home server _(identical to the live deployment excluding user data and secret material)_. 

The requirements for running the server are:
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

To download, build, and start the server:

Change config.xml 'dbuser' property to your MySQL/MariaDB default user (usually root).
Change docker-compose.yml and .env to use your domain and certificate.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/minecrafthome/minecrafthome.git
cd minecrafthome
docker-compose up -d
```

At this point, you should be able to visit [localhost](http://localhost:80/minecrafthome) from your browser to see the server webpage. You may also connect BOINC client to this local server using the same URL.

377,FabricMC/fabric,Java,"# Fabric API

Essential hooks for modding with Fabric.

Fabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:

- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions
- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.
- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.
- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.

Also check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.

For support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).

## Using Fabric API to play with mods

Make sure you have install fabric loader first. More information about installing Fabric Loader can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

To use Fabric API, download it from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/releases) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).

The downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods` folder.

## Using Fabric API to develop mods

To setup a Fabric development environment, check out the [Fabric example mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) and follow the instructions there. The example mod already depends on Fabric API.

To include the full Fabric API with all modules in the development environment, add the following to your `dependencies` block in the gradle buildscript:

### Groovy DSL

```groovy
modImplementation ""net.fabricmc.fabric-api:fabric-api:FABRIC_API_VERSION""
```

### Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
modImplementation(""net.fabricmc.fabric-api:fabric-api:FABRIC_API_VERSION"")
```

Alternatively, modules from Fabric API can be specified individually as shown below (including module jar to your mod jar):

### Groovy DSL

```groovy
// Make a collection of all api modules we wish to use
Set<String> apiModules = [
    ""fabric-api-base"",
    ""fabric-command-api-v1"",
    ""fabric-lifecycle-events-v1"",
    ""fabric-networking-api-v1""
]

// Add each module as a dependency
apiModules.forEach {
    include(modImplementation(fabricApi.module(it, FABRIC_API_VERSION)))
}
```

### Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
// Make a set of all api modules we wish to use
setOf(
    ""fabric-api-base"",
    ""fabric-command-api-v1"",
    ""fabric-lifecycle-events-v1"",
    ""fabric-networking-api-v1""
).forEach {
    // Add each module as a dependency
    modImplementation(fabricApi.module(it, FABRIC_API_VERSION))
}
```

<!--Linked to gradle documentation on properties-->
Instead of hardcoding version constants all over the build script, Gradle properties may be used to replace these constants. Properties are defined in the `gradle.properties` file at the root of a project. More information is available [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/organizing_gradle_projects.html#declare_properties_in_gradle_properties_file).

## Contributing

See something Fabric API doesn't support, a bug or something that may be useful? We welcome contributions to improve Fabric API.
Make sure to read [the development guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Modules

Fabric API is designed to be modular for ease of updating. This also has the advantage of splitting up the codebase into smaller chunks.

Each module contains its own `README.md`* explaining the module's purpose and additional info on using the module.

\* The README for each module is being worked on; not every module has a README at the moment

378,stanhebben/MineTweaker3,Java,"# MineTweaker 3

Welcome to the MineTweaker 3 source! MineTweaker 3 is the new version of MineTweaker and will be released for both 1.7.2 and 1.6.4, as well as upgraded as new versions of Minecraft become available.

## License and contributions

The source code is freely available in here, at GitHub. The mod itself may be redistributed in modpacks as long as these modpacks are distributed for free. No money can be made from the distribution of the mod.

Want to contribute? That's great! Contact me if you want to propose or discuss new features. Adding new mods is definitely welcome and doesn't need prior permission (just follow the existing structure, add it & make a pull request). Credit will be granted appropriately.

## Project structure and building

The MineTweaker 3 source is setup as a multi-project Gradle project:

- ZenScript is the custom scripting engine
- MineTweaker3-API is the shared API for all MineTweaker versions
- MineTweaker3-MCXYZ-Main are the main MineTweaker implementations for Minecraft X.Y.Z
- MineTweaker3-MCXYZ-Mod-XXX are the mod support projects. They are compiled and obfuscated independently and then assembled later

### Developing and running MineTweaker from source

Configuration settings are stored in configuration.gradle . *If buildSrc fails to compile you might have to edit the
+`javaToolsJar` location in `configuration.gradle`*

In order to use the project, you have to execute the setupDecompWorkspaceAll (or use setupDecomWorkspace17X if you have errors on the 1.6.4 forge patches). It will prepare all the subprojects for you. After that, you can simply run minecraft with the runClient task in MineTweaker3-XYZ-Main project, which will run MineTweaker (without mod support). Likewise, you can use the runClient task on any of its mod support library subprojects, which will run MineTweaker with only the mod support for that specific mod.

The following global tasks are available:

- setupDecompWorkspaceAll: sets up all workspaces in all subprojects
- setupDecompWorkspace17X: sets up all workspaces for anything that's not 1.6.4
- assembleMC164: builds MineTweaker for Minecraft 1.6.4
- assembleMC172: builds MineTweaker for Minecraft 1.7.2
- assembleMC1710: builds MineTweaker for Minecraft 1.7.10
- assembleAll: builds all versions of MineTweaker

### Adding mod support

When starting a new mod support library, it is best to start from an existing one. For instance, copy the NEI support library, and remove the source files inside the src/java/main directory. Then you can work with it like any other support library. Make sure to update configuration.gradle to add the projects in there.

### Building a release

Use the assembleAll task to build all versions, or assembleMCxxx tasks to build a specific version. The files will be output in /build/libs .

## Customized builds

You may modify and redistribute your own customized version of MineTweaker as long as you mark your own version of MineTweaker as CUSTOMIZED (that is, put CUSTOMIZED in both the jar and mod name) and as long as you make the modified source code publicly available. Obviously, I cannot offer support for customized builds. Just be so kind to mention the original source and author (me) ;)

### Compiling
[Setup Java](#setup-java)

[Setup Git](#setup-git)

[Setup Schematica](#setup-schematica)

[Compile Schematica](#compile-schematica)

[Updating Your Repository](#updating-your-repository)

#### Setup Java
The Java JDK is used to compile Schematica.

1. Download and install the Java JDK.
    * [Windows/Mac download link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). Scroll down, accept the `Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for Java SE`, and download it (if you have a 64-bit OS, please download the 64-bit version).
    * Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).
        * Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin`
        * Archlinux: `pacman -S jdk7-openjdk`
        * Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk`
        * Fedora: `yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk`
2. Set up the environment.
    * Windows: Set environment variables for the JDK.
        1. Go to `Control Panel\System and Security\System`, and click on `Advanced System Settings` on the left-hand side.
        2. Click on `Environment Variables`.
        3. Under `System Variables`, click `New`.
        4. For `Variable Name`, input `JAVA_HOME`.
        5. For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_45` exactly as shown (or wherever your Java JDK installation is), and click `Ok`.
        6. Scroll down to a variable named `Path`, and double-click on it.
        7. Append `;%JAVA_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `Ok`. Make sure the location is correct; double-check just to make sure.
3. Open up your command line and run `javac`. If it spews out a bunch of possible options and the usage, then you're good to go. If not try the steps again.

#### Setup Git
Git is used to clone Schematica and update your local copy.

1. Download and install Git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/).
2. *Optional* Download and install a Git GUI client, such as Github for Windows/Mac, SmartGitHg, TortoiseGit, etc. A nice list is available [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

#### Setup Schematica
This section assumes that you're using the command-line version of Git.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to a place where you want to download Schematica's source (eg `C:\Development\Github\Minecraft\`) by executing `cd [folder location]`. This location is known as `mcdev` from now on.
3. Execute `git clone git@github.com:Lunatrius/Schematica.git`. This will download Schematica's source into `mcdev`.
4. Right now, you should have a directory that looks something like:

***
    mcdev
    \-Schematica
        \-Schematica's files (should have build.gradle)
***

#### Compile Schematica
1. Execute `gradlew setupDevWorkspace`. This sets up Forge and downloads the necessary libraries to build Schematica. This might take some time, be patient.
    * You will generally only have to do this once until the Forge version in `gradle.properties` changes.
2. Execute `gradlew build`. If you did everything right, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` will be displayed after it finishes. This should be relatively quick.
    * If you see `BUILD FAILED`, check the error output (it should be right around `BUILD FAILED`), fix everything (if possible), and try again.
3. Go to `mcdev\Schematica\build\libs`.
    * You should see a `.jar` file named `Schematica-#.#.#-#.#.#.#-universal.jar`.
4. Copy the jar into your Minecraft mods folder, and you are done!

#### Updating Your Repository
In order to get the most up-to-date builds, you'll have to periodically update your local repository.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to `mcdev` in the console.
3. Make sure you have not made any changes to the local repository, or else there might be issues with Git.
    * If you have, try reverting them to the status that they were when you last updated your repository.
4. Execute `git pull master`. This pulls all commits from the official repository that do not yet exist on your local repository and updates it.

Shamelessly based this README off [pahimar's version](https://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3).

Provide several useful functions to build a Minecraft Launcher.

Most packages are targeting the [Electron](https://electronjs.org) environment. Feel free to report issues related to it.

### Looking for C# Launcher Core?

Introduce the awesome .net framework launcher core, [ProjBobcat](https://github.com/Corona-Studio/ProjBobcat).

It's the next generation Minecraft launcher core written in C# providing the freest, fastest and the most complete experience. https://craftmine.fun

### Featured Launcher

- [x-minecraft-launcher](https://github.com/voxelum/x-minecraft-launcher): An launcher provides general electron api related to minecraft launching (in renderer side), making other developers can easily create new launcher view.
- [PureLauncher](https://github.com/Apisium/PureLauncher): An awesome Minecraft Launcher using React to build beautiful UI.


## Installation & Usage

This repo maintaining multiple mini packages for specific functions.

If you use electron to write a minimum launcher, you can install `@xmcl/core` which only has such functions:

- Parse existed Minecraft version
- Launch the game

If you have bigger ambition on your launcher, you want it be able to download/install Minecraft, then you can have `@xmcl/installer`, which contains the functions of:

- Get the version information of Minecraft/Forge/Liteloader/Fabric
- Install Minecraft/Forge/Liteloader/Fabric to the game folder

If you still not satisfied, as you want even provide the function to parse existed resource pack and mods under game folder, then you will have `@xmcl/mod-parser` and `@xmcl/resourcepack` modules, which contain such functions:

- Parse Forge/Liteloader/Fabric mods metadata
- Parse resource pack metadata

There are more packages for advantage usages, and you can check out the getting started section to navigate.

### Bundle & Treeshaking

The module built with `ES5` module option by typescript. To use treeshake, please make sure your bundle system support esm import/export.

Some bundler like webpack, rollup support treeshake by default. Just make sure you dont do something like `import * as SomeNamespace from ...`, which will bundle the whole package.
(But `import { xxx } from 'xxx'` will still work)

### CommonJS

If you don't have a bundler to transform the package, you can still use it in cjs. The webpack will pick the `""main""` field in `package.json` which is pointing to the cjs version.

It means you don't need to do anything in extra ideally.

### Electron Version

Recommend to use the latest electron, so you don't need to setup babel with webpack 4.

## Getting Started

## [Download link](https://github.com/tryashtar/image-map/releases)

This is a simple Windows application that converts images to Minecraft maps using the latest colors. It works for both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition.

## How to Use

### <img src=""ImageMap4/Icons/world.png"" width=16> Worlds Tab

Here you can see a list of your Java and Bedrock worlds. Click on any one to open it. By default, the program looks in these folders:
* `%appdata%\.minecraft\saves`
* `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds`

If you have worlds saved elsewhere, such as on a server or in Education Edition, you can click the buttons to change where to look.

You can also drag and drop a world folder directly onto the program to open it, no matter where it is.

### <img src=""ImageMap4/Icons/map.png"" width=16> Maps Tab

**In World**

On the right, you'll see maps that are already in your world, if any. Click on maps to select them.

For getting those maps on a wall easily, click ""Generate Structure."" Your selected maps will be arranged in a grid, and a structure block will be added to your inventory. Place it and load the structure to get your maps!

You can also delete maps or change their ID. Don't worry, everything can be undone with <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd>.

**Importing**

On the left, you can import images to convert into maps.

All Minecraft maps must be 128x128 pixels, and Java Edition has a limited color palette, so there are a few options to control how your image should be modified.

You can split it into multiple maps, change the scaling mode, and choose the color distance and dithering algorithms. See which one you like best.

When you're ready, click ""Send All to World"" to transfer your maps to the world. If ""Create structures"" is checked, you'll automatically get a structure block in your inventory that can be used to place the maps on a wall.

### Version Palettes

For Java Edition, the program detects the version of your world to determine which colors are available. Here are all the supported palettes:

## Chat

I generally am on the `irc.spi.gt` irc network in the `#think` channel.
Feel free to pop in to say hi, [Webchat can be found here](https://irc.spi.gt/iris/?channels=think)

## Building
For more detailed info and platform specific instructions check the [wiki](https://github.com/Thinkofname/steven-rust/wiki/Compiling-and-or-running).

Currently requires SDL2, OpenSSL and **nightly** rust to build.

`cargo build --release`

Windows users can download pre-compiled builds from here: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/thinkofdeath/steven-rust/branch/master
(Select your platform, Click the artifacts tab and download Steven.zip)

The Visual Studio 2015 Redistributable is required to run these builds.

## Running

### Standalone

Just running steven via a double click (Windows) or `./steven` (everything else)
will bring up a login screen followed by a server list which you can select a server
from.

==========

CraftGuide is a Minecraft mod started back in October 2011, with the intention of providing the functionality of Risugami's Recipe Book, but a user interface which could better handle the absurd number of recipes encountered when playing with certain mods.

Since then, it has slowly developed features to enhance the main functionality, such as making the GUI resizable to comfortably handle screens of all sizes at all GUI scales, and adding an API so that other mods can display recipes which wouldn't normally be visible (such as those for machines, or custom implementations of IRecipe).


### Contributing
If you want to contribute to CraftGuide, simply submit an issue or pull request.

>A Powerful Minecraft Automatic-Economy Plugin for ```1.13-1.19``` with many features!
<img src=""https://github.com/Unprotesting/Auto-Tune/blob/master/.github/AtLogo.png?raw=true"" width=""100""/>

## :star: Overview

*Auto-Tune is a Minecraft plugin that allows you to create an automated economy for your server. Prices of items will be automatically adjusted based on supply and demand. When an item is purchased by many players but sold by few, Auto-Tune will raise the price to lower demand/increase supply and vice versa. Auto-Tune fixes a critical problem in Minecraft server economies and provides a better experience for players and servers. You can check out our feature set below.*

## :heavy_check_mark: Features

- :ballot_box_with_check: ```Advanced automatic pricing model based on supply and demand```
- :ballot_box_with_check: ```Configurable GUI shop, with positioning and naming options```
- :ballot_box_with_check: ```Easy selling panel to sell items quickly```

- :ballot_box_with_check: ```All messages are configurable```
- :ballot_box_with_check: ```Tutorial to help new players```
- :ballot_box_with_check: ```And much, much more...```

## :question: Why use Auto-Tune

Auto-Tune identifies and fixes a significant problem in Minecraft servers that has remained underdeveloped and ignored for too long. This issue is the poor implementation of an economy and markets into Minecraft.

Previous solutions that allow for trading between players have lacked flexibility, player engagement, and realism. These issues are due to server economy plugins that cannot adapt to the speed at which the economy in Minecraft changes. We designed Auto-Tune with this in mind. By automating the price-setting process, server admins can sit back and watch the prices fluctuate as the supply and demand of items bounce back and forth.

Not only does this assist administrators in managing a server's economy, but it also allows the server players to engage with the economy more rigorously. We have strenuously tested Auto-Tune to be fit for any environment and created systems designed to assist server admins in building the best economy possible for the specific needs of their server. Auto-Tune is a powerful and highly customizable plugin that has a feature set rich enough to satisfy any server. We at Auto-Tune are passionate and optimistic about Minecraft plugin development and building a community that loves Minecraft and economics!

## 🎀 Examples

Alternatively, you can help the project by starring the repository or telling others about NPCLib. :smile:

## Developers

### Usage

There are multiple ways you can make use of NPCLib.

1. The first option is to shade `npclib-plugin.jar` in to your plugin.
2. The second option is to put `npclib-plugin.jar` under your `plugins` folder. By doing this, you no longer need to shade the API JAR. Though, do not forget to add `NPCLib` as a dependency in your `plugin.yml`!
3. The third option (and the one I recommend most) is to shade the library using Maven. I recently added NPCLib to the OSSRH (OSS Repository Hosting) which allows you to easily import NPCLib into your project.

#### Maven repository
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>ossrh</id>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

#### Maven dependency

If you have NPCLib under your `plugins` folder, you may use the following:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.jitse</groupId>
        <artifactId>npclib-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.11.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
If you do not want to have NPCLib in your `plugins` folder, you need to use the `npclib-plugin` artifact and [shade it](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/) accordingly.

Always make sure to use the latest stable release. [Click here](https://github.com/JitseB/NPCLib/releases/latest) to view the latest release.

#### Repacking the library
To make sure the classes won't be twice at the same place. I recommend repacking the library into your package. (Otherwise [issue #79](https://github.com/MinecraftLibraries/NPCLib/issues/79) might occur.) You can do that as follow:
```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.1.0</version>
      <!-- Do not include the <configuration>...</configuration> part if you are using Sponge! -->
      <configuration>
        <relocations>
          <relocation>
            <pattern>net.jitse.npclib</pattern>
            <!-- Replace this with your package! -->
            <shadedPattern>your.package</shadedPattern>
          </relocation>
        </relocations>
      </configuration>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>package</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>shade</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

**[Click here](https://github.com/JitseB/NPCLib/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) for an elaborate explanation on how to use NPCLib in your next project.**

### Versioning
For NPCLib I use the follow versioning system:
* 1.x.x: Where the 1 indicates the major version of the library. When this number changes, it's highly likely there're big API changes.
* x.1.x: Where the 1 indicates the minor version of the library. When this number changes, a feature is added or a high priority bug is fixed.
* x.x.1: Where the 1 indicates another minor version of the library. When this number changes, a small bug has been fixed.

### Building your own version

1. [Download](https://github.com/JitseB/NPCLib/archive/master.zip) or clone this repository.
2. You can build the project using `mvn clean install`.

The API JAR will be under `/api/target/` and the plugin JAR (which includes all necessary NMS code) will be under `/plugins/target/`.

## What does spark do?

spark is made up of three separate components:

* **CPU Profiler**: Diagnose performance issues.
* **Memory Inspection**: Diagnose memory issues.
* **Server Health Reporting**: Keep track of overall server health.

### :zap: CPU Profiler

spark's profiler can be used to diagnose performance issues: ""lag"", low tick rate, high CPU usage, etc.

It is:

* **Lightweight** - can be ran in production with minimal impact.
* **Easy to use** - no configuration or setup necessary, just install the plugin/mod.
* **Quick to produce results** - running for just ~30 seconds is enough to produce useful insights into problematic areas for performance.
* **Customisable** - can be tuned to target specific threads, sample at a specific interval, record only ""laggy"" periods, etc
* **Highly readable** - simple tree structure lends itself to easy analysis and interpretation. The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.

It works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.

There are two different profiler engines:
* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)
* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.

### :zap: Memory Inspection

spark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.

* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory
  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class
  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see next item)
* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory
  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.
  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.
* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server
  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.
  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use

### :zap: Server Health Reporting

spark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.

These metrics include:

* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command
* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)
* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the process, and by the overall system
* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process
* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system

As well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.

For a comparison between spark, WarmRoast, Minecraft timings and other profiles, see this [page](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/misc/spark-vs-others) in the spark docs.

> # 介绍 (Introduction)

## （零）序
本项目是基于《我的世界》游戏风格的仿造，仿造原则是：  
在原版风格基础上**创新性地**增加游戏**真实性**，但拒绝完全复制（体现在“*仿*”字），
同时处理好创新与真实的关系，既在创新之中体现真实，又在真实之中发展创新，故名之***两个原则***  
《我的世界》风格的界面仅是一个*载体*和*躯壳*，却非真正的*灵魂*所在。

### 三个战略
目前，本项目仍处在初级发展阶段，bug和性能方面都不是很好。对此，根据*真实性原则*，需要坚持*三个战略*（即*改革优化创新战略*）：
1. ***改革***：泛指修bug与代码体系修改；
3. ***优化***：泛指不断提高运行速度，增加FPS，减小CPU及内存占用等；
2. ***创新***：泛指不断发展新功能。

目前阶段，这三个战略缺一不可，并且是当前发展中需长期坚持的主要及重要战略。


## （一）总述
本项目使用兼容多平台的JavaScript(ES6+)+HTML(HTML5+)+CSS3编写，利用WebGL技术，依赖Three.js进行更便捷的3D渲染。  
> 之所以选择JavaScript+HTML+CSS是因为便于绘制图形化界面（HTML5+CSS3），并易于打包成EXE(electron)和APK(HTML5+)以兼容各个平台

规定：世界中的每1px为1cm，每100px为1m，每个*普通方块*为边长1m=100cm=100px的立方体。
> 注：*deskgood*~~为某初中同桌的外号~~，作为游戏主角名，莫要在意名称![](https://img.shields.io/github/search/wzh656/MinecraftWeb/deskgood)


## （二）操作方式(Operation)
> ### 电脑版

| 事件						| 操作												|
| -------------------------	| -------------------------------------------------	|
| `W S A D`					| *前 后 左 右*方向移动(move)						|
| *鼠标左键*				| 删除所指位置的方块(remove)						|
| *鼠标右键*				| 在所指位置放置手中选中方块(place)				|
| *鼠标中键*				| 重置时间流速(1.0倍)								|
| *鼠标滚轮*				| 来回切换手中选中方块									|
| `shift`+*鼠标滚轮*		| 以1.5倍比例调节时间流速								|
| *空格*					| 跳跃(jump)										|
| 双击`W`，或 `Ctrl`+`W`	| 疾跑(run)											|
| `ESC`						| 暂停游戏/关闭交互窗口（命令方块、背包）			|
| `Pause-Break`				| 暂停/开始游戏 或 关闭交互窗口（命令方块、背包）	|
| `F2`						| 截图												|
| `F3`						| 打开/关闭dat.gui									|
| `shift`+`F3`				| 关闭/开启调试（将自动刷新）						|
| `F4`						| 开始/停止录屏								|

> ### 手机版（触屏版）

1. 移动：左边的大圆
    摇杆操作，`touch`移动控制行走，拖拽超过`100px`疾跑
2. 跳跃：右边的小圆
    可以与移动同时操作。  
    按下(`touch-start`)之后，如果脚下有方块并且距离上一次跳跃超过约1s（需有休息时长），
    则将沿着y轴正半轴方向以约5m/s的速度跳起来
3. 滑动屏幕界面：转动角色视角
4. 短按屏幕界面：`touch`<1s
	放置('deskgood.put')当前手中选中的方块到点击处
5. 长按屏幕界面：`touch`>1s
	删除('deskgood.delete')点击处的方块并将其放入手中（优先放入选中处）
6. 点击下方工具栏方块：
	选中手中的方块


## （三）引入的调试工具（Shift+F3关闭/显示）
由于项目长期处于调试状态，调试工具可能默认开启，调试工具可能影响游戏性能，若无需使用请按`Shift`+`F3`关闭

+ > *state.js*：左上角Canvas
    
    可以使用该工具查看当前渲染状态，该工具有3种状态，点击切换
    + fps:<font style=""color:blue;"">蓝色/fps</font>  
        查看当前每秒可渲染的帧数，1s更新1次
    + ms:<font style=""color:green;"">绿色/ms</font>  
        查看渲染每帧需要的时间/ms，渲染1帧更新1次
    + MB:<font style=""color:red;"">红色/MB</font>  
        查看当前运行占用的内存/MB(兆字节)

+ > *dat.gui.js*：右上角
    
    点击可展开，内含一些配置调试选项  
    注意：对性能有很大影响，可按`shift`+`F3`隐藏（会重新加载页面生效）

+ > *VConsole*与*eruda*：右下角（可拖动）
    
    手机调试工具，点击右下角即可看到一堆输出，可以调试html+css+js，也可以运行JavaScript代码，等效于*命令方块*

398,mcxr-org/MCXR,Java,"# ⚠️ MCXR Development has been paused until further notice ⚠️
The details behind this are messy but MCXR Desktop will not recive any updates or fixes for the forseeable future. 

Until then I recommend using the [Vivecraft Port](https://github.com/ferriarnus/VivecraftMod) which has Quilt, Forge and Fabric support.

399,QuiltMC/quilt-mappings,Java,"# Quilt Mappings

Quilt Mappings is a set of open, unencumbered Minecraft mappings, free for everyone to use under the Creative Commons Zero license. The intention is to let 
everyone mod Minecraft freely and openly, while also being able to innovate and process the mappings as they see fit.

To see the current version being targeted, check the branch name!

## Usage
To use Quilt Mappings-deobfuscated Minecraft for Minecraft modding or as a dependency in a Java project, you can use [quilt-gradle](https://github.com/quiltmc/quilt-gradle) Gradle plugin. See [fabric wiki tutorial](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) for more information.

To obtain a deobfuscated Minecraft jar, [`./gradlew mapNamedJar`](#mapNamedJar) will generate a jar named like `<minecraft version>-named.jar`, which can be sent to a decompiler for deobfuscated code.

Please note to run the Quilt Mappings build script **Java 17** or higher is required!

## Contributing

Our goal is to provide high-quality names that make intuitive sense. In our experience, this goal is best achieved through contribution of original names, rather than copying names from other mappings projects. While we believe that discussions relating to the names used by other mappings projects can be useful, those names must stand up to scrutiny on their own - we won't accept names on the grounds that they're present in other mappings projects. 

We recommend discussing your contribution with other members of the community - either directly in your pull request, or in our other community spaces. We're always happy to help if you need us!

Please have a look at the [naming conventions](/CONVENTIONS.md) before submitting mappings.

### Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run `./gradlew mappings` (Linux, macOS) or `gradlew mappings` (Windows) to open [Enigma](https://github.com/QuiltMC/Enigma), a user interface to easily edit the mappings
3. Commit and push your work to your fork
4. Open a pull request with your changes

## Gradle
Quilt Mappings uses Gradle to provide a number of utility tasks for working with the mappings.

### `mappings`
Setup and download and launch the latest version of [Enigma](https://github.com/QuiltMC/Enigma) automatically configured to use the merged jar and the mappings.

Compared to launching Enigma externally, the gradle task adds a name guesser plugin that automatically maps enums and a few constant field names.

### `mappingsUnpicked`
Same as above, but unpicks the constants and launches Enigma with them. Can be a little bit slower to get going.


### `build`
Build a GZip'd archive containing a tiny mapping between official (obfuscated), [hashed-mojmap](https://github.com/QuiltMC/mappings-hasher), and Quilt Mappings names (""named"") and packages enigma mappings into a zip archive.

### `mapNamedJar`
Builds a deobfuscated jar with Quilt mappings and automapped fields (enums, etc.). Unmapped names will be filled with [hashed-mojmap](https://github.com/QuiltMC/mappings-hasher) names.

### `decompileCFR`
Decompile the mapped source code. **Note:** This is not designed to be recompiled.

### `downloadMinecraftJars`
Downloads the client and server Minecraft jars for the current Minecraft version to `.gradle/minecraft`

### `mergeJars`

Merges the client and server jars into one merged jar, located at `VERSION-merged.jar` in the project directory
where `VERSION` is the current Minecraft version.

This repo is a collection of scripts for use with BlockLauncher, and therefore, Minecraft Pocket Editon (Android).

You do not have permission to redistrubite or modify any software contained within this github repository without prior written permission from me. This is to stop people directly profiting from taking my mods and putting them in an app with ads, behind an ad riddled link or similar. I will be contacting anyone that is doing this and reporting them to the appropriate organisations (e.g. Google Play in the case of apps which directly profit from my mods).

402,DarkStorm652/DarkBot,Java,"# DarkBot

  This project is an attempt at a better rewrite of the Minecraft client for use in automating Minecraft that I started around early July of last year. This isn't limited to simply botting; other uses include (completely) custom clients, server monitors, and more. Multi-protocol support was recently added, allowing the same version of the bot to run on different Minecraft versions (assuming that the corresponding protocol version provider is in the protocols/ directory).

[An example task that loads WorldEdit schematic files and constructs them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mahhJ6zK2BU) (written by someone else who has since lost the source)

## Getting Started

### With Eclipse
> Open Eclipse.  
> Right-click in the package explorer area and click Import...  
> Select Git > Projects from Git and click Next.  
> Select URI and click Next.  
> Paste the Git URL for DarkBot ([https://github.com/DarkStorm652/DarkBot.git](https://github.com/DarkStorm652/DarkBot.git)) and click Next, then click Next again at the Branch Selection dialog.  
> Change the directory to [your eclipse workspace]/DarkBot (change the [] to the actual path to your workspace by clicking browse) and click Next.  
> Select Use the New Project wizard and click Finish.  
> In the New Project wizard, select Java Project and click Next.

### Without Eclipse
> Clone the project with git or download the source zip from the github page and extract it.  
> Open the folder and run build.xml (this may require cmd to execute).  
> Wait for the build to complete and run DarkBot.jar from cmd with --help for args.  
> Hurray! The downside to this is that you have to delete the folder and redo these steps every time you want to update.

### To Run

Open Terminal or Command Prompt  
Switch to the directory with DarkBot.jar (`cd path/to/DarkBot` with Terminal or `cd C:\path\to\DarkBot` with Command Prompt)

For CLI Bot:
> Print arguments with `java -jar DarkBot.jar -t bot --help`  
> Use `java -jar DarkBot.jar -t bot <args>` where `<args>` consists of arguments from the list printed before (such as --username <username> or --server <server:port>)
   * If arguments keep getting printed, you are missing required arguments or have the wrong format

For CLI Spambot:
> Print arguments with `java -jar DarkBot.jar -t spambot --help`  
> Use `java -jar DarkBot.jar -t spambot <args>` where `<args>` consists of arguments from the list printed before (such as --bot-amount <count> or --server <server:port>)
   * If arguments keep getting printed, you are missing required arguments or have the wrong format

For GUI (NOT RECOMMENDED, INCOMPLETE):
> Run `java -jar DarkBot.jar -t gui --force`

## Introduction

MCSManager Panel（abbr: MCSM Panel）is a multilingual, lightweight, out-of-the-box, and multi-instance Minecraft server control panel with Docker support.

MCSManager panel can help you manage multiple physical servers in one place, and create game servers at any host dynamically. It also provides a secure and reliable user permission system for a seamless multi-user experience.

![Screenshot.png](https://mcsmanager.com/main.png)
![Screenshot.png](https://mcsmanager.com/main2.png)

<br />

## Runtime Environment

MCSManager panel can run on both Windows and Linux platforms without a database or complicated system configuration. As a lightweight control panel, you only need Node.js to run it. 

Required Node.js version: **14.17.6** or above.

<br />

## Install

### Windows

For the Windows systems, the MCSM panel has been **compiled into a click-to-run version**. 

Download it from the official site: [https://mcsmanager.com/](https://mcsmanager.com/)

<br />

### Linux

**Quick Install with one command**

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcsmanager/Script/master/setup_en.sh | bash
```

- The script is designed for Ubuntu/Centos/Debian/Archlinux of AMD64 architecture only.
- Use `systemctl start mcsm-{web,daemon}` to start service after installtion.
- Directory for panel components and runtime: `/opt/mcsmanager/`

<br />

**Linux Manual Installation**

- If the installation script does not work, you can try the following steps to install manually.

```bash
# switch to the installation directory. Please create it in advance with 'mkdir /opt/' if not exist.
cd /opt/
# Download runtime environment (Node.js). Ignore this step if you have Node.js 14+ installed already.
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.17.6/node-v14.17.6-linux-x64.tar.gz
# Decompress archive
tar -zxvf node-v14.17.6-linux-x64.tar.gz
# Add program to system PATH
ln -s /opt/node-v14.17.6-linux-x64/bin/node /usr/bin/node
ln -s /opt/node-v14.17.6-linux-x64/bin/npm /usr/bin/npm

# Prepare installation directory
mkdir /opt/mcsmanager/
cd /opt/mcsmanager/

# Download the web project
git clone https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager-Web-Production.git
# Rename and enter the directory
mv MCSManager-Web-Production web
cd web
# Install dependencies
npm install --production
cd /opt/mcsmanager/

# Download the Daemon
git clone https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager-Daemon-Production.git
# Rename and enter the directory
mv MCSManager-Daemon-Production daemon
cd daemon
# Install dependencies
npm install --production

# Please open two terminals or Screen
# Start the daemon first
cd /opt/mcsmanager/daemon
# Start the daemon
node app.js

# Start the web project (in the second terminal/screen)
cd /opt/mcsmanager/web
# start the application
node app.js

# Access http://localhost:23333/ for web interface
# In general, the web application will scan and connect to the local daemon automatically.
```

- Note, the above steps do not register the panel components to system service. You have to use 'screen' to manage it or register the system service manually.

<br />


## Data Directories

Web Config & Data: `/opt/mcsmanager/web/data/`

Daemon Config & Data `/opt/mcsmanager/daemon/data/`

<br />


## Update

Reference: https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager/wiki/Update-MCSManager

> Note, backup of `data` directory before each update is highly recommended.

<br />

## Projects

This software requires all three projects to run. The code you use for installation is the result of compilation and integration.

[**Web Backend**](https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager)

- Role: Control Center
- Responsible for: Backend APIs, user data management, and communication & authentication with daemons.

[**Frontend/UI**](https://github.com/MCSManager/UI)

- Role: The user interfaces for the backend.
- Responsible for: Displaying statistics via the web interface, sending requests, and communicating with daemons. The final product of this project is pure static files. 

[**Daemon**](https://github.com/MCSManager/Daemon)

- Role: Slave/controlled remote node
- Responsible for: Controlling all instances on localhost and managing the actual instance process. It is capable to communicate with all objects.

<br />

## Build the Development Environment

This is intended for developers. If you are not a developer, you can safely ignore these.

You can continue to develop or preview all the projects once they are running under the development environment. Please make sure to be in compliance with the license. 

**Web Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager.git
cd MCSManager
npm install
npm run start
# By default, use ts-node to run Typescript code directly
# By default, run on port 23333.

```

**UI Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MCSManager/UI.git
cd UI
npm install
npm run serve
# Preview the interface at http://localhost:8080/
# All the requests will be redirected to port 23333.
```

**Daemon Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MCSManager/Daemon.git
cd Daemon
npm install
npm run start
# After running, please connect the daemon to the control panel via the web interface.
# By default, run on port 24444
```

<br />

## Browser Compatibility

- Support mainstream modern browsers like `Chrome` `Firefox` `Safari` `Opera`.
- `IE` support has been dropped.

<br />

## i18n

The MCSManager internationlization was done by [Lazy](https://github.com/LazyCreeper), [KevinLu2000](https://github.com/KevinLu2000), [zijiren233](https://github.com/zijiren233) and [Unitwk](https://github.com/unitwk).

<br />

## Panel Permission

The control panel will check the user list while running. If there is no user available, a default administrator user will be created. 

If you forget your only administrator account, you can back up all the current user data, regenerate a new admin account, and overwrite the previous one. 

> User Data: /opt/mcsmanager/web/data/Users/*.json

Stevenarella is designed to support multiple protocol versions, so that client
development is not in lock-step with the server version. The level of
support varies, but the goal is to support major versions from 1.7.10
up to the current latest major version. Occasionally, snapshots are also supported.

Forge servers are supported on 1.7.10 - 1.12.2 (FML) and 1.13.2 - 1.16.5 (FML2).

Support for older protocols will _not_ be dropped as newer protocols are added.

## Downloads

Windows, Ubuntu Linux, and macOS users can download pre-compiled builds
from [GitHub Actions](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/iceiix/stevenarella/goto?ref=master).

```

For progress on web support, see [www/](./www).

## Running

### Standalone

Just running Stevenarella via a double click (Windows) or `./stevenarella` (everything else)
will bring up a login screen followed by a server list which you can select a server
from.

## Contributions

Stevenarella is an [OPEN Open Source Project](https://github.com/openopensource/openopensource.github.io):

> Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given
> commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project
> is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

### Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history on the `master` branch.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style. Please install and run [cargo fmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) before merging any changes.

### Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be
subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe
you have something valuable to add or change.

### Credits

406,DarkLBP/Krothium-Launcher,Java,
407,Admicos/minecraft-wayland,Shell,"# The better way of running Minecraft Without XWayland

Because I **REALLY** had nothing better to do with my life.

## Requirements

- A version of Minecraft >= 1.13

  - Older versions use a version of LWJGL that doesn't work with this patch

- MultiMC (or derivatives) (optional)

  - Other launchers (not the official one) might or might not have similar settings
  - If they don't, you can throw this into your Java arguments, changing the file
    path as needed depending on your distro:
    `-Dorg.lwjgl.glfw.libname=/usr/lib/libglfw.so`

- A distro with a patched GLFW package

  - This guide has steps for Arch, Fedora, Gentoo, and Guix
  - Or the knowledge on how to patch packages in your distribution.
    - In which case you can skip step 2 of this guide, as it will not apply to you
      and you should know what to do with the `.patch` files in this repo already

## Side effects

- Forge will not work without another workaround
- The controls page (and anywhere a keyboard key is shown) is a bit wonky
  - Keys you replace through your compositor (example: `caps:swapescape`) will
    require you to use the original key
- Originally made for Sway, other desktops (GNOME, for example) might need to
  manually makepkg the `libdecoration` branch for GNOME specific fixes or download
  an unofficial package listed below (until a new GLFW version releases)
  - KDE works on both branches, but with some [minor issues](https://github.com/Admicos/minecraft-wayland/issues/8#issuecomment-997155245)

## Step 1: Setting up MultiMC to use the system GLFW

Go to `Settings` > `Minecraft`, and enable `Use system installation of GLFW`.

If you have a Wayland-compatible version of GLFW installed (`glfw-wayland` on
Arch) you can try launching the game. It will most likely error out with
something about window focus not being supported. In that case, you are in the
right direction.

## Step 2: Installing the patched GLFW library

If you're not under a distro with a guide here, you're mostly on your own.
You can try waiting for someone else to write a guide for your distro, I guess.

### Option 1: Use the AUR

Install the `glfw-wayland-minecraft` package from the AUR.

If you're using a desktop that needs it, try using the **unofficial**
`glfw-wayland-minecraft-libdecoration` package, which packages the
`libdecoration` branch of this repository to the AUR.

### Option 2: Build the PKGBUILD manually

`git clone` this repository to somewhere, and run `makepkg -si` inside. It will
ask you to replace your existing GLFW package if already installed.

If you're using a desktop that needs it, consider running `git checkout libdecoration`
before running `makepkg -si`. This is a (probably) slightly unstable version that
works better on some desktops.

### Option 3: Install the Fedora package

Install the Fedora package from https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/lyessaadi/minecraft-wayland-glfw/.
See https://github.com/Admicos/minecraft-wayland/issues/4 for more information.

You might need to change the Java arguments even if you are using a launcher that
can replace GLFW. See [this issue](https://github.com/Admicos/minecraft-wayland/issues/14)
for more details.

### Option 4: Patch the Gentoo package

Patch Gentoo's GLFW package by following the guide at https://github.com/Admicos/minecraft-wayland/issues/6

### Option 5: Install the Guix package

Install the Guix package from https://github.com/Admicos/minecraft-wayland/issues/18

## Step 3: There is no step 3

This should be it. Try launching Minecraft now and see if it works.

## Bonus: XWayland per instance

If some version of Minecraft doesn't work with the patch enabled, you can
disable it through MultiMC just for that version by

- Right clicking on your instance
- Clicking `Edit instance`
- Going to `Settings` > `Workarounds`
- Enabling `Native Libraries` override switch
- Disabling the GLFW option

You can also disable the global switch and enable the patch per instance if
that's how you want to roll.

## Bonus: Making Forge work

Due to ""Forge being Forge"", you will need to add
`-Dfml.earlyprogresswindow=false` to your Java arguments to make Forge instances
start up properly. See [issue #1](https://github.com/Admicos/minecraft-wayland/issues/1)
for more information.

https://github.com/Hopson97/HopsonCraft/tree/e803ca5fbf51df134cfa7e87c14275c6c73fce8e

# Note

When I made this, I was highly inexperienced at programming (Less than 2 years), and the code is mostly pretty messy and game crashes a lot. 

I have kept it on my GitHub for historical reasons, seeing as I have videos about this on my YouTube channel.


## Versions (As seen in the YouTube videos)

This game has gone through major rewrites and refactors overtime.

To see the source code as it was in episodes 1, 2 and 3 of ""Creating Minecraft in C++/ OpenGL"" videos, look at an older commit here:

https://github.com/Hopson97/HopsonCraft/tree/90a5d596d07dfe71b5dbf47ec76c0b0802ec9dfa


## Dependencies
The project requires these libraries: SFML (minimum 2.4), GLEW 2.0+ (OpenGL 3.3+), and OpenGL Maths Library (GLM).

Compile using compiler flags:

Windows -> ``-std=c++14 -O3 -s -lglew32s -lglu32 -lopengl32 -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-audio -lsfml-system -lsfml-window``

Linux -> ``-std=c++14 -O3 -s -lGLEW -lGLU -lGL -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-audio -lsfml-system -lsfml-window``


All the libaries for Linux (At least, on Ubuntu) can be installed with


`` sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev``

`` sudo apt-get install libglew-dev``

`` sudo apt-get install libglm-dev``



## Contributing
An easy way to contribute is to look for the ``///@TODO`` parts in the code. please actually test before doing a pull request.

  * util10 - My integer->string toolset for this project.
  * dumbcraft (.c, .h)
  * an x86 demo for dumbcraft (compiles and runs on Linux)
  * an AVR-buildable copy (see below)
  * a tool for generating gzipped map chunks (requires Linux)

The AVR folder contains:

  * avr_print - SPI debugging toolset (for use with tinyisp and tinyispterm)
  * my bitbanged ethernet (MAC + ARP + ICMP + UDP + TCP) driver (see below)
  * a really dumb HTTP server
  * a driver for SD cards (and a FAT32 driver) NO SUPPORT FOR FAT16!

Oh yeah, with debugging on, this all fits in about 17kB.

Depending on your settings (dumbcraft circular buffer, etc.) you can use
from about 600 bytes of static RAM to about 1.5 comfortably.

Sadly this does not include the stack, so if you can push data to the
clients and forget about it, that's probably for the best.


----What the dumbcraft does (and doesn't do)----

Dumbcraft is split into a C file for the core, and a user C file that contains
various action-related functions that you must support, i.e.:
  * void InitDumbgame()
  * void DoCustomPreloadStep( uint8_t playerid )
  * void PlayerTickUpdate( int playerid )
  * void PlayerClick( uint8_t playerid, uint8_t x, uint8_t y, uint8_t z )
  * void PlayerUpdate( uint8_t playerid )
  * uint8_t ClientHandleChat( char * chat, uint8_t chatlen )

The .C file contains the core dumbcraft toolset.  Because it doesn't support
any mode of communications with the outside world, all communications must be
done through various functions.  These functions interface 

What works:
  * The stock Minecraft 1.4.2 Server on Windows or Linux (most of the time)
  * More than one player
  * Running around
  * Pulling Levers
  * Updating blocks
  * Loading main map chunk
  * Chat

What doesn't work:
  * Day/night
  * MOBs
  * Physics
  * Animations
  * Crafting
  * Falling Blocks
  * Mining
  * Placing Blocks
  * Collecting things
  * The Nether
  * The End
  * Redstone
  * Water
  * Lava
  * Well, just about everything.

Take a look through dumbcraft.c to get a better hint as to how this all goes together.

----Mapmake----

Map make creates a chunk to be sent by 0x33.  This code doesn't seem to work
very well... It seems to work well enough to make big plot of green ground.

Try dinking with this to figure out why some other chunk types don't work?

It's used to generate the 'mapdata' buffer used in dumbcraft.c


----My IP Stack----

I wrote my own TCP/IP stack for this project, I've been working with it for
quite some time and I needed a good test.  Minecraft has shown to be an
excellent test.  It uses an ENC424j600 from Microchip in SPI mode. It doesn't
use the SPI hardware on an AVR, instead it bit bangs all communications with
it.  This is to make it possible to put it on any geographically convenient
pins.  (I do this on one-layer)

The stack contains the main MAC code and a file for the low level SPI
functionality.  Since the SPI has to be really fast, I've opted to write it
in assembly.

If you want to use the TCP/IP stack, you can feel free to copy it all out,
including test.c and rip out my code.  You'll need the basic callbacks from
TCP or UDP, but other than that you're good to go.

Reconfigure eth_config.h to your situation and profit.  You can get a UDP
server in a little under 4kB, and TCP for an extra ~2.5k more.

I included an HTTP server with it, but it barely counts as an HTTP server
since it requires additional code to serve ... anything.  You can see that it
is difficult to get it to server webpages from the SD card :-/.


----My FAT32/SD SPI Stack----

This stack is still pretty buggy but lets you read files from a FAT32
partition on a SD card.  It can either bin the root or in the FIRST partition.

It can list files in a folder, seek to folders, open files and read them 
sequentially... that's... about... it. 

The SD driver supports SDHC and SD cards and supports reading/writing at the
block level.  Keep in mind the FAT32 driver does not support writing.

Consider the test.c in the avr folder an example of how to do this.

----Building----

You'll need at the minimum: avrdude, avr-gcc and basic build-utils. I
recommend you get my copy of tinyispterm since that'll help you debug.

It prints debugging data through the SPI port if -DMUTE_PRINTF isn't set.
Everything's geared around a TinyISP from LadyAda... I personally use a tiny
variant of it I designed.  You can get the single-layer designs and the tool
here:

https://github.com/cnlohr/tinyispterm

The hardware details for this project can be found in the avr_hardware folder.

I am not a trained electrical engineer.  You will have to know your stuff
before venturing on this project!  It is tricky, and I didn't really document
anything very well.

I designed the PCB in ExpressPCB and designed the schematic later.  They don't
match and I got frustrated, so trust the PCB over the SCH.

Yes, it's a single layer.  No, there are no jumpers.


----Resources and Thanks----

Special thanks to the folks at #mcdevs.  They made this awesome thing here:

Welcome to coolAlias' Minecraft Forge Modding Tutorials!

I've tried to add tutorials for subjects that I either haven't seen elsewhere, needed updating or just needed
further explanation.

Most of my tutorials are NOT set up like full proper code and WILL give you lots of errors if you just
copy and paste it into Eclipse.

That being said, all of the code I provide I have personally used and tested, so if you read all the comments,
follow the directions and do your best to understand what the code is doing, I'm confident you, too, will be
able to get it working.

I'm by no means, however, an expert in Java, so if you are and spot errors in my code or just have a better way
of doing it, then please let me know!

If you have any suggestions on how to make the tutorials more clear, if you have a question or if you just want to
say hi, leave a comment or p.m. me on minecraftforum.net and I'll see what I can do :)

Run a bedrock server in a Docker container

This Dockerfile will download the Bedrock Server app and set it up, along with its dependencies.

If you run the container as is, the `worlds` directory will be created inside the container, which is unadvisable. It is highly recommended that you store your worlds outside the container using a mount. It is also likely that you will want to customize your `server.properties` file. The best way to do this is also using a `server.properties` file outside the container using a mount.

Here is a `docker run` command that will do that, assuming you have a `worlds` directory and `server.properties` file at `/minecraft`. (You should change the path to wherever your stuff is.)

    $ sudo docker run -d --name=minecraft\
        -v '/minecraft/worlds:/bedrock-server/worlds'\
        -v '/minecraft/server.properties:/bedrock-server/server.properties'\
        --network host\
        --restart=always\
        nguyer/bedrock-server

If you wanted to use custom resource packs, a whitelist, or other things, you could also mount those paths as well. Separating the content from the sever executable means that you can safely destroy your Docker container without losing your world. This will come in handy when there are updates to the server app, and you want to redeploy the container.

Hopefully this is helpful to folks. Happy Minecrafting!

## Bug Reports [![bug]][bug-link]

Please report any and all bugs you might encounter while playing with this mod (this only applies to versions of Minecraft this mod is currently being developed for). Suggestions are also welcome.
However before reporting a bug please update to the latest version of the mod to see if it still persists.
If you want to post bug reports for older versions, make sure to tell me what version you are using and the version of Forge you are using.
If you report a bug and I request more feedback, the label 'Awaiting reply' will be added, if I have had no response for 5 days after adding that label, the issue will be closed.

## Technical Documentation [![wiki]][wiki-link]

AgriCraft is documented in the official GitHub wiki. Note that
this kind of information is, most of the time, only needed by pack creators and not the average user.

## Compilation Notes

The latest versions of ForgeGradle require some tweaking to get builds working. The two most important things to note are as follows:

1. ForgeGradle does not like JDKs newer than JDK8. To develop install [openjdk8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot), and update `gradle.propeties` to contain the following:
```
org.gradle.java.home = C:\\Program Files\\AdoptOpenJDK\\jdk-8.0.275.1-hotspot
```

2. The default JVM heap size is too small to handle decompilation of MineCraft. Builds fail without increasing the heap size that Gradle allocates for the build. Update `gradle.propeties` to contain the following:
```
# Sets default memory used for gradle commands. Can be overridden by user or command line properties.
# This is required to provide enough memory for the Minecraft decompilation process.
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx3G
```

> Note: We do not provide a default `gradle.properties` file as it is discouraged by the Gradle documentation, given that the file may contain maven login information and the likes.

### About

The goal of this project is to provide tools for mod developers so they no longer have to worry about performance, or
limitations of Minecraft's archaic rendering engine. That said, this is primarily an outlet for me to have fun with
graphics programming.

### Instancing

Flywheel provides an alternate, unified path for entity and tile entity rendering that takes advantage of GPU
instancing. In doing so, Flywheel gives the developer the flexibility to define their own vertex and instance formats,
and write custom shaders to ingest that data.

### Shaders

To accomodate the developer and leave more in the hands of the engine, Flywheel provides a custom shader loading and
templating system to hide the details of the CPU/GPU interface. This system is a work in progress. There will be
breaking changes, and I make no guarantees of backwards compatibility.

### Plans

- Vanilla performance improvements
- Compute shader particles
- Deferred rendering
- Different renderers for differently aged hardware

### Getting Started (For Developers)

Add the following repo and dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name ""tterrag maven""
        url ""https://maven.tterrag.com/""
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation fg.deobf(""com.jozufozu.flywheel:Flywheel-Forge:${flywheel_version}"")
}
```
`${flywheel_version}` gets replaced by the version of Flywheel you want to use, eg. `1.18-0.3.0.3`

For a list of available Flywheel versions, you can check [the maven](https://maven.tterrag.com/com/jozufozu/flywheel/Flywheel-Forge/).

If you aren't using mixed mappings (or just want to be safe), add the following properties to your run configurations:
```groovy
property 'mixin.env.remapRefMap', 'true'
property 'mixin.env.refMapRemappingFile', ""${projectDir}/build/createSrgToMcp/output.srg""
```
This ensures that Flywheel's mixins get properly loaded in your dev env.

### 介绍


傻瓜式一键操作，全自动化执行程序

自动起调MinecraftUWP，自动结束RuntimeBroker.exe

游戏30分钟左右不会出现“解锁完整游戏”

游戏关闭后自动还原注册表，启动服务项

项目开源免费完全公开，火绒、360、管家无报毒


### 使用方法:

 1.双击打开软件

 2.单击“启动程序”按钮
 
 3.等待提示“启动完成”即可开始游戏

 注：程序之所以要申请管理员权限，是为了修改部分注册表，在关闭程序后会自动还原修改后的注册表
 
 ### 命令行调用格式
 
         [Implement   |   Reduction]   <Notify_NO>  <Interface_NO>

         命令解释：

         [必须]
         Implement		启动并执行程序
         Reduction		启动并执行还原

         <可选>
         Notify_NO		隐藏任务栏通知

         <可选>
         Interface_NO       隐藏图形化界面
         
         示例：
         
         Reduction   Interface_NO 

注意：Releases版本并不支持命令行调用，请克隆源码后自行编译使用

### 软件执行流程(单击“启动程序后”)：

 1.开始释放内嵌入注册表文件到用户临时文件夹

 2.执行导入注册表操作

 3.使用NET命令停止系统ClipSVC 服务

 4.删除释放过程中的注册表文件

 5.通过Process的Start方法调起 MinecraftUWP

 6.后台等待30秒后开始使用Tasklist命令显示Microsoft Store 应用及其关联的进程

 7.开始扫描MinecraftUWP关联的RuntimeBroker进程PID

 8.获取到PID后使用Tasklist命令强制结束进程，此时游戏启动完毕

 9.启动后台每隔1秒自动扫描与Minecraft相关联的RuntimeBroker进程并结束

 10.同时检测Minecraf进程是否退出，绕过退出程序自动关闭，同时还原注册表和服务项


### 注意事项：

 1.游戏运行时不能关闭本程序，关闭游戏后程序会自动退出
  
 2.需要提前下载MinecraftUWP否则会提示没有安装MinecraftUWP
  
 3.启动成功后软件会自动隐藏到托盘，如果结束程序后则将在30分钟内游戏自动失效

 4.本程序仅供学习交流，严禁商用或其他方法用途，严禁非法第三方倒卖，软件永久开源免费

 5.不要在任务栏中，或任务管理器中直接结束本进程，进程检测到退出游戏后10秒内自动退出并还原注册表和服务项，退出完成后会有提示

 6.正常使用情况下不会造成系统故障，如果遇到商店无法下载应用的情况下，或者无法安装UWP应用时，可用尝试打开程序，直接点击“关闭程序”按钮，程序会重新还原系统修改项

# Phosphor (for Fabric)
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric.svg)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric.svg)
![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric.svg)

Phosphor is a free and open-source Minecraft mod (under GNU GPLv3) aiming to save your CPU cycles and improve performance by optimizing one of Minecraft's most inefficient areas-- the lighting engine.
It works on **both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod**.

The mod is designed to be as minimal as possible in the changes it makes, and as such, does not modify the light model or interfaces of vanilla Minecraft. Because of this, Phosphor should be compatible
with many Minecraft mods (so long as they do not make drastic changes to how the lighting engine works.) If you've ran into a compatibility problem, please open an issue!


---

## Installation

### Manual installation (recommended)

You will need Fabric Loader 0.10.x or newer installed in your game in order to load Phosphor. If you haven't installed
Fabric mods before, you can find a variety of community guides for doing so [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install).

#### Stable releases

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric.svg)

The latest releases of Phosphor are published to our [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and
[GitHub release](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/releases) pages. Releases are considered by our team to be
**suitable for general use**, but they are not guaranteed to be free of bugs and other issues.

Usually, releases will be made available on GitHub slightly sooner than other locations.

#### Bleeding-edge builds (unstable)

[![GitHub build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/gradle-ci/1.16.x/dev)](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

If you are a player who is looking to get your hands on the latest **bleeding-edge changes for testing**, consider
taking a look at the automated builds produced through our [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml?query=event%3Apush).
This workflow automatically runs every time a change is pushed to the repository, and as such, the builds it produces
will generally reflect the latest snapshot of development.

Bleeding edge builds will often include unfinished code that hasn't been extensively tested. That code may introduce
incomplete features, bugs, crashes, and all other kinds of weird issues. You **should not use these bleeding edge builds**
unless you know what you are doing and are comfortable with software debugging. If you report issues using these builds,
we will expect that this is the case. Caveat emptor.

### CurseForge

[![CurseForge downloads](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_372124_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/phosphor)

If you are using the CurseForge client, you can continue to find downloads through our
[CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/phosphor). Unless you are using the CurseForge
client, you should prefer the downloads linked on our Modrinth or GitHub release pages above.

---

### Reporting Issues

You can report bugs and crashes by opening an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/issues).
Before opening a new issue, use the search tool to make sure that your issue has not already been reported and ensure
that you have completely filled out the issue template. Issues which are duplicates or do not contain the necessary
information to triage and debug may be closed.

Please note that while the issue tracker is open to feature requests, development is primarily focused on
improving hardware compatibility, performance, and finishing any unimplemented features necessary for parity with
the vanilla renderer.

### Community
[![Discord chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat%20on-discord-7289DA?logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://caffeinemc.net/discord)

We have an [official Discord community](https://caffeinemc.net/discord) for all of our projects. By joining, you can:
- Get installation help and technical support with all of our mods
- Be notified of the latest developments as they happen
- Get involved and collaborate with the rest of our team
- ... and just hang out with the rest of our community.

---

### Building from sources

Support is not provided for setting up build environments or compiling the mod. We ask that
users who are looking to get their hands dirty with the code have a basic understanding of compiling Java/Gradle
projects. The basic overview is provided here for those familiar.

#### Requirements

- JDK 8 or newer
  - You will need JDK 8 in order to build Phosphor, which can be installed through a supported package manager such as
    [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows or [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) on other platforms. If you'd prefer to
    not use a package manager, you can always grab the installers or packages directly from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
- Gradle 6.7 or newer (optional)
  - The [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:using_wrapper) is provided in
    this repository can be used instead of installing a suitable version of Gradle yourself. However, if you are building
    many projects, you may prefer to install it yourself through a suitable package manager as to save disk space and to
    avoid many different Gradle daemons sitting around in memory.

#### Building with Gradle

Phosphor uses a typical Gradle project structure and can be built by simply running the default `build` task. After Gradle
finishes building the project, you can find the build artifacts (typical mod binaries, and their sources) in
`build/libs`.

**Tip:** If this is a one-off build, and you would prefer the Gradle daemon does not stick around in memory afterwards,
try adding the [`--no-daemon` flag](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon)
to ensure that the daemon is torn down after the build is complete. However, subsequent builds of the project will
[start more slowly](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:why_the_daemon) if the Gradle
daemon is not available to be re-used.


Build artifacts ending in `dev` are outputs containing the sources and compiled classes
before they are remapped into stable intermediary names. If you are working in a developer environment and would
like to add the mod to your game, you should prefer to use the `modRuntime` or `modImplementation` configurations provided by
Loom instead of these outputs.

428,Rilshrink/Minecraft-Disablers,Java,"# Minecraft-Disablers
A list of known Minecraft Anticheat Disablers, this is mostly so the Dev's of the Anticheats know how to patch them.

All of these disablers are patched and no longer work, and since I have no intention of updating these, I will be archiving the repo.
But will provide a short explanation on why I believe these worked.

Current Disablers: <br>
Kauri, worked because the anticheat required the client to sync at least one transaction packet, but by not sending one the anticheat would just disable all checks until it did. <br>
OnlyMC, worked because delaying transactions disabled a majority of the checks, and then the flight and speed checks were fully disabled by forcing a flag every 50 ticks, sending the C0CPacketInput also disabled some speed checks.  <br>
LunarGG, worked the same as OnlyMC disabler, but with a client spoofer built in and different delays. <br>
HazelMC, worked by delaying keep alives and transactions caused the anticheat to 'loosen' up on it's checks, sending an invalid keep alive packet every tick also disabled most of the checks, most likely the ping spoof checks as well.<br>
Mineplex Combat, since the combat checks relied on the keep alive packets, not sending them wasn't an option, but sending invalid ones was, and caused the server to disable auto-bans, but it still flagged,<br>
Verus Combat, worked by disabling the syncing of your sprint state to the server and by canceling transactions. You had to send at least one transaction packet otherwise it would just flag you for ping spoofing. This disabled a majority but not all of the combat checks. <br>
ACMC Disabler, worked by slowing down the game timer to not trigger any timer checks, force flagging every 15 ticks to disable flight checks, and delaying transactions and keepalives disabled a lot of checks on it's own, mostly the combat and movement checks.<br>
Cold Network, worked the same as the other Verus disablers, except they used a newer version where it was patched and would ban after 10 minutes of play, flagged ping spoof every 2-3 minutes. <br>
EarthPolMC disabler, worked by making matrix anticheat think you were connecting to the server through geyser by sending a a custom payload through their plugin channel, this was patched soon after it was discovered by making it only accept the custom payloads from the server or proxy.
<br>
Disabler.js was for Liquidbounce

翻译规范
--------
首先在[README.md](README.md)中的翻译状态里想要翻译的章节后面以以下格式加入自己的名字

`// 你的名字 [翻译状态]`

翻译状态可选为:

* 待译
* 翻译
* 完成
* 更新

`待译`为已经认领这个章节的翻译，但还没有开始翻译

`翻译`为正在翻译中

`完成`为已经完成的翻译

`更新`为<http://wiki.vg/Protocol>中产生了更新，而原先翻译的已经过期，重新开始翻译

例子：

当多人合作一个翻译时可以写成名字中间加上`&`的形式

如：`// bangbang93 & Bluek404 [翻译]`

当产生更新时可以在后面追加翻译者

如：`// bangbang93 [完成] Bluek404 [更新]`

认领完成翻译章节后可以开始翻译

先fork项目到自己的git，然后翻译完成后发起`Pull Request`

等审核通过后再修改章节的翻译状态

433,svenhjol/Charm,Java,"# Charm for Minecraft 1.18.2

## Version 4.x
Charm is a vanilla-plus mod for Minecraft, inspired by the Quark mod.

It requires Fabric API, Minecraft 1.18.2 and Java 17.

If you would like to participate in testing pre-release versions of Charm, please get in touch on [Discord](https://discord.gg/S649dvZ9Ma) (working invite link as of august 2022!)

### Why has my issue been closed?
Sadly, we don't have the time to support versions earlier than **1.18.2**.  There's barely any time for supporting the latest version!

If we thought your issue related to an earlier version then we closed it to try and decrease the amount of issue noise.

We welcome any developer support to maintain older versions. Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/S649dvZ9Ma).

Please note that creating any new issues about earlier versions will also be closed.

  * example: `no_treasure_enchantment_trading.CheckIfTradeableMixin`
* The `helper.LoadCustomModelPartsMixin` cannot be blacklisted as Charm requires it to render custom models and will otherwise cause a client-side crash.
* `helper`, `core` and `event` mixins can be blacklisted but this is not recommended as doing so will cause inconsistent behavior in Charm.


### Support
**Charm 4.x for Minecraft 1.18 is now the main version of Charm.**

Charm for Minecraft 1.17 (and older versions) will no longer receive official support.

A Forge port of the latest version of Charm may be considered.

We had been stucked in the world of color for four years.  The wait is over. You can control over Minecraft Java Edition Version 1.16.5 in Scratch 3 or Python.

## Remote control over Minecraft in Python / Scratch

By using the Minecraft API and coding in Scratch or Python, you can place blocks and move Steve around, and more.

As you know, it is of course fun to do such things manually in the Minecraft world, but it is also fun to code and automatically remote control. And it's an excellent subject to get you interested in learning Scratch or Python.

In my class, we even include the use of git and GitHub.com, which is a fun self-study material for both young learners and experienced ones. **It's a great way to learn a programming language by having something you want to do first.**

I believe the same is true for learning a foreign language. **Don't learn the language, use the language.** (I've just created the 'quote' now. ;) )

## Editions / versions and environments
There are three different environments depending on the combination of Minecraft editions and versions.

Regarding Python modules, the Java version 1.12.2 uses the traditional mcpi as in the Raspi version, while the Java version 1.16.5 uses the new mcje.  The Java version 1.16.5 uses the new mcje. The RasPi version does not require any mods, while each of the two Java versions requires the same version of mods as Minecradt, and a Forge to house the mods.
|Minecraft|Forge|mod|Python module|Scratch + Extension|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Pi Edition (MCPI) Raspbery Pi|-|-|[mcpi](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi)|Scratch 1.4 + [Scratch2MCPI](https://github.com/scratch2mcpi/scratch2mcpi)|
|Java Edition (MCJE) 1.12.2|[Forge 1.12.2](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html)|[RemoteControllerMod-1.12.2 v0.02](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/remote-controller/files/3242375)|[mcpi](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi)|[Scratch 3 + MC Ext 1.12.2](https://takecx.github.io/scratch-gui/1-12-2/)|
|Java Edition (MCJE) 1.16.5|[Forge 1.16.5](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.5.html)|[RemoteControllerMod-1.16.5 v0.05](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/remote-controller/files/3363255)|[mcje](./mcje)|[Scratch 3 + MC Ext 1.16.5](https://takecx.github.io/scratch-gui/1-16-5/)|

***Optifine mod might fine tune on the visual effects of Minecraft Java Edition to make it snappier.You need to select the same version as Minecraft. https://optifine.net/downloads
You might need Java SE 8 JRE to run Forge. https://www.java.com/download/***

You can run Minecraft Java Edition on Linux including Raspberry Pi, Mac and PC. Unfortunately, at least so far, new comer who cannnot have Mojang account are very difficult to launch the Java Edition app on Raspberry Pi. (Minecraft account system is in the middle of migrating from Mojang account to Microsoft one. Arm platform is not on the support list of Microsoft.)

The changes of Minecraft Java Edition at 1.13 ""Update Aquatic"" were so significant that we were forced to stay with 1.12.2 for three long years in remote control over Minecraft. We broke thruough it by the huge effort of [takecx](https://github.com/takecx), then made it possible to work with version 1.16.5.

But, once again, the changes at version 1.17 was pretty large. For the compatibility with the latest version of Minecraft-Forge 1.17, please wait for a while to cope with it. Or, rather concider to join force with us for the development of [RemoteControllerMod](https://github.com/takecx/RemoteControllerMod) on GitHub.com to reduce the wait.

## Examples to draw something in the Minecraft world by voxels or volume pixels
Sorry, examples are only in Python, not for Scratch, so far. See [takecy's](https://github.com/takecx/RemoteControllerMod) to start in Scratch.
 - [hello_MCPI.py](./hello_MCPI.py), [hello_MCJE.py](./hello_MCJE.py), [hello_MCJE1122.py](./hello_MCJE1122.py) : Typical Hello World code. **Try this first to learn how to select Python module mcpi or mcje for your environment.** Install mcpi from Pypi with this. ``` pip3 install mcpi --user ``` or ``` pip install mcpi --user ```

 - [digitalclock.py](digitalclock.py) to display a realtime clock with time and date using 5 x 7, LCD font in the format as follows (also shown in the picture above):
```
        2021-06-26
         21:28:45
```
Using hand-made LCD font on double-buffer display, you can learn 'class'.  I prefer SEA_LANTERN_BLOCK for the time display but unfortunately it's not available in MCPI.

 - [axis_flat.py](axis_flat.py) : Module to draw x, y, and z-axis and to flatten the world in addition. Nice and useful utilities to prepare the world for learning.
  Axes with the virtual origin at (0, 80, 0) for MCJE, or (0, 20, 0) for MCPI using block types as follows:
    - x-axis: Stone blocks
    - y-axis: Grass on soil blocks
    - z-axis: Gold blocks

 - [demo1.py](./demo1.py), [demo2.py](./demo2.py) : Usage of axis_flat or double_buffer_display modules.
 - **(NEW)** [maze.py](./maze.py) : Building a maze in the Minecraft world by supu, Python VTuber. Watch her movie on YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK3V8q2EiI8
**""Remote Minecraft by Python""** — Let's create a maze automatically and play with it on Minecraft. — In Japanese without English CC, sorry.
   - Using a Python module named mazelib. It contains C++ code and there is no binary on Pypi, it needs to be built during installation with pip.
   - Mac, Linux：
       - You should be successfully install it with ```sudo pip3 install mazelib ```
   - Windows 10／11：
      - If you have C++ build tools, this will help you: ```pip install mazelib``` Or read the details below.

**You might think learning axes or axis are too difficult and too early for age 8, but it's not true. If you are thinking to *teach* them, it's true. Just try to assist kids learning. Umm, I'm just playing with them, actually.**

[<img src=""./images/maze_letters.png"" width=""220"">](./images/maze_letters.png) [<img src=""./images/maze_blocks.png"" width=""220"">](./images/maze_blocks.png)

(Maze by letters, and by blocks in the Minecraft world.)

### Widows C++ build tools (for mazelib)
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Open the ""Tools for Visual Studio 2022"" in the page, then get the ""Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022"". The app/tool is stand-alone so **you don't need the Visual Studio 2022 itself.**

Launch the app and you will know the name is Visual Studio Installer.
Click the ""Modify"" then, find and install two components below in the ""Individual components"" tab.
 1.  Windows 10 SDK or Windows 11 SDK
 1.  MSVC v143 VS2022 C++ x64/x86 build tool (latest)

Search windows sdk for (1), search msvc for (2).

## Files used in the digital clock
#### [digitalclock.py](./digitalclock.py)
 - Main file to run by ```python digitalclock.py```
 - Using two display instances, for date and time, respectively.
 - You need to select a python module from mcpi or mcje to use.
#### [double_buffer_display.py](./double_buffer_display.py)
 - Class BufferDisplay
 - Display class with two flipping buffers to draw only changes from the last time.
 - You need to select a python module from mcpi or mcje to use.
#### [font_5x7.py](./font_5x7.py)
 - 5 x 7 LCD font design
#### [param_MCJE.py](./param_MCJE.py), [param_MCJE1122.py](./param_MCJE1122.py), [param_MCPI.py](./param_MCPI.py)
 - Constant values of several block types, world size, and axis parameters
 - param_MCJE: for Minecraft Java Edition 1.16.5
 - param_MCJE1122: for Minecraft Java Edition 1.12.2
 - param_MCPI: for Minecraft Pi Edition
#### [mcje (minecraft java edition)](./mcje)
 - Python module forked from https://github.com/lasteamlab/mcpi2
 - Named as mcje, and updated for use of Minecraft Java Edition 1.13 or later.
 - It might be available in Pypi later.

## Preparation for Python, Java and other environment

(in the pipeline...)
 - Python 3.7.9
 - Java SE 8 JRE

Paths
-----
Locations:

* `bin`   - Compiled binaries
* `share` - Distributed read-only data
* `user`  - User-created modifiable data

Where each location is on each platform:

* Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source:
    * `bin`   = `bin`
    * `share` = `.`
    * `user`  = `.`
* Windows installed:
    * `bin`   = `C:\Program Files\Minetest\bin (Depends on the install location)`
    * `share` = `C:\Program Files\Minetest (Depends on the install location)`
    * `user`  = `%APPDATA%\Minetest`
* Linux installed:
    * `bin`   = `/usr/bin`
    * `share` = `/usr/share/minetest`
    * `user`  = `~/.minetest`
* macOS:
    * `bin`   = `Contents/MacOS`
    * `share` = `Contents/Resources`
    * `user`  = `Contents/User OR ~/Library/Application Support/minetest`

Worlds can be found as separate folders in: `user/worlds/`

Configuration file
------------------
- Default location:
    `user/minetest.conf`
- This file is created by closing Minetest for the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
    `--config <path-to-file>`
- A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in
    `location_of_exe/../minetest.conf` and also `location_of_exe/../../minetest.conf`

Command-line options
--------------------
- Use `--help`

#### Download

You can install Git for easily keeping your copy up to date.
If you don’t want Git, read below on how to get the source without Git.
This is an example for installing Git on Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install git

For Fedora users:

    sudo dnf install git

Download source (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times) using Git:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest.git
    cd minetest

Download minetest_game (otherwise only the ""Development Test"" game is available) using Git:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game.git games/minetest_game

Download IrrlichtMt to `lib/irrlichtmt`, it will be used to satisfy the IrrlichtMt dependency that way:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht.git lib/irrlichtmt

Download source, without using Git:

    wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    cd minetest-master

Download minetest_game, without using Git:

    cd games/
    wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    mv minetest_game-master minetest_game
    cd ..

Download IrrlichtMt, without using Git:

    cd lib/
    wget https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    mv irrlicht-master irrlichtmt
    cd ..

#### Build

Build a version that runs directly from the source directory:

    cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=TRUE
    make -j$(nproc)

Run it:

    ./bin/minetest

- Use `cmake . -LH` to see all CMake options and their current state.
- If you want to install it system-wide (or are making a distribution package),
  you will want to use `-DRUN_IN_PLACE=FALSE`.
- You can build a bare server by specifying `-DBUILD_SERVER=TRUE`.
- You can disable the client build by specifying `-DBUILD_CLIENT=FALSE`.
- You can select between Release and Debug build by `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug or Release>`.
  - Debug build is slower, but gives much more useful output in a debugger.
- If you build a bare server you don't need to compile IrrlichtMt, just the headers suffice.
  - In that case use `-DIRRLICHT_INCLUDE_DIR=/some/where/irrlichtmt/include`.

- Minetest will use the IrrlichtMt package that is found first, given by the following order:
  1. Specified `IRRLICHTMT_BUILD_DIR` CMake variable
  2. `${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/irrlichtmt` (if existent)
  3. Installation of IrrlichtMt in the system-specific library paths
  4. For server builds with disabled `BUILD_CLIENT` variable, the headers from `IRRLICHT_INCLUDE_DIR` will be used.
  - NOTE: Changing the IrrlichtMt build directory (includes system installs) requires regenerating the CMake cache (`rm CMakeCache.txt`)

    ZSTD_INCLUDE_DIR                - Directory that contains zstd.h
    ZSTD_LIBRARY                    - Path to libzstd.a/libzstd.so/ztd.lib

### Compiling on Windows using MSVC

### Requirements

- [Visual Studio 2015 or newer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Compiling and installing the dependencies

It is highly recommended to use vcpkg as package manager.

After you successfully built vcpkg you can easily install the required libraries:
```powershell
vcpkg install zlib zstd curl[winssl] openal-soft libvorbis libogg libjpeg-turbo sqlite3 freetype luajit gmp jsoncpp opengl-registry --triplet x64-windows
```

- **Don't forget about IrrlichtMt.** The easiest way is to clone it to `lib/irrlichtmt` as described in the Linux section.
- `curl` is optional, but required to read the serverlist, `curl[winssl]` is required to use the content store.
- `openal-soft`, `libvorbis` and `libogg` are optional, but required to use sound.
- `luajit` is optional, it replaces the integrated Lua interpreter with a faster just-in-time interpreter.
- `gmp` and `jsoncpp` are optional, otherwise the bundled versions will be compiled

There are other optional libraries, but they are not tested if they can build and link correctly.

Use `--triplet` to specify the target triplet, e.g. `x64-windows` or `x86-windows`.

### Compile Minetest

#### a) Using the vcpkg toolchain and CMake GUI
1. Start up the CMake GUI
2. Select **Browse Source...** and select DIR/minetest
3. Select **Browse Build...** and select DIR/minetest-build
4. Select **Configure**
5. Choose the right visual Studio version and target platform. It has to match the version of the installed dependencies
6. Choose **Specify toolchain file for cross-compiling**
7. Click **Next**
8. Select the vcpkg toolchain file e.g. `D:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
9. Click Finish
10. Wait until cmake have generated the cash file
11. If there are any errors, solve them and hit **Configure**
12. Click **Generate**
13. Click **Open Project**
14. Compile Minetest inside Visual studio.

#### b) Using the vcpkg toolchain and the commandline

Run the following script in PowerShell:

```powershell
cmake . -G""Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_GETTEXT=OFF -DENABLE_CURSES=OFF
cmake --build . --config Release
```
Make sure that the right compiler is selected and the path to the vcpkg toolchain is correct.

### Windows Installer using WiX Toolset

Requirements:
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/)

In the Visual Studio 2017 Installer select **Optional Features -> WiX Toolset**.

Build the binaries as described above, but make sure you unselect `RUN_IN_PLACE`.

Open the generated project file with Visual Studio. Right-click **Package** and choose **Generate**.
It may take some minutes to generate the installer.

### Compiling on MacOS

#### Requirements
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Install dependencies with homebrew:

```
brew install cmake freetype gettext gmp hiredis jpeg jsoncpp leveldb libogg libpng libvorbis luajit zstd
```

#### Download

Download source (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times) using Git:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest.git
cd minetest
```

Download minetest_game (otherwise only the ""Development Test"" game is available) using Git:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game.git games/minetest_game
```

Download Minetest's fork of Irrlicht:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht.git lib/irrlichtmt
```

#### Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14 \
    -DCMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK=LAST \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../build/macos/ \
    -DRUN_IN_PLACE=FALSE -DENABLE_GETTEXT=TRUE

make -j$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)
make install
```

#### Run

```
open ./build/macos/minetest.app
```

Docker
------
We provide Minetest server Docker images using the GitLab mirror registry.

Images are built on each commit and available using the following tag scheme:

* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:latest` (latest build)
* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<branch/tag>` (current branch or current tag)
* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<commit-id>` (current commit id)

If you want to test it on a Docker server you can easily run:

	sudo docker run registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<docker tag>

If you want to use it in a production environment you should use volumes bound to the Docker host
to persist data and modify the configuration:

	sudo docker create -v /home/minetest/data/:/var/lib/minetest/ -v /home/minetest/conf/:/etc/minetest/ registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:master

Data will be written to `/home/minetest/data` on the host, and configuration will be read from `/home/minetest/conf/minetest.conf`.

**Note:** If you don't understand the previous commands please read the official Docker documentation before use.

You can also host your Minetest server inside a Kubernetes cluster. See our example implementation in [`misc/kubernetes.yml`](misc/kubernetes.yml).


Version scheme
--------------
We use `major.minor.patch` since 5.0.0-dev. Prior to that we used `0.major.minor`.

- Major is incremented when the release contains breaking changes, all other
numbers are set to 0.
- Minor is incremented when the release contains new non-breaking features,
patch is set to 0.
- Patch is incremented when the release only contains bugfixes and very
minor/trivial features considered necessary.

Since 5.0.0-dev and 0.4.17-dev, the dev notation refers to the next release,
i.e.: 5.0.0-dev is the development version leading to 5.0.0.
Prior to that we used `previous_version-dev`.

441,BuiltBrokenModding/ICBM-2,Java,"## What is ICBM?

#### NOTE

**The current 1.7.10 versions are complete rewrites of ICBM, most things from 1.6.4 are not implemented yet. There are plans to implement missing content later, either in ICBM or in separate mods.**

ICBM is a Minecraft Mod that introduces intercontinental ballistic missiles to Minecraft.

## Who owns ICBM
Originally ICBM was owned mostly by Calclavia with the Sentry guns belonging to DarkGuardsman. After a few event and lack of progress ownership was shifted fully to DarkGuardsman. This was in exchange for majority ownership of Resonant Induction to Calclavia. 

That being said as far as DarkGuardsman is concerned the mod downloads are community property. At any time the mod is no longer supported or updated anyone is welcome to take over. Given that the new maintainer understands who owns the code at the end of the day.

445,essentials/Essentials,Java,"Essentials Development Readme
=============================

The official repository is at:
https://github.com/essentials/Essentials

We use NetBeans 7.3 for development.

Recommended NetBeans plugins:

* Git
* PMD & FindBugs ( http://kenai.com/projects/sqe/pages/Home )

Building
--------
To build with Maven, use the command
```
mvn package dependency:copy
```

Jar files can then be found in the /jars folder


Commit Guidelines
-----------------

Commits should fall into one of 3 areas:

- `[Feature]`: Commits which are features should start with `[Feature]` and followed by a quick summary on the top line, followed by some extra details in the commit body.

- `[Fix]`: Commits which fix bugs, or minor improvements to existing features should start with `[Fix]` and followed by a quick summary on the top line, followed by some extra details in the commit body.

- Commits which fix bugs caused by previous commits (since last release), or otherwise make no functionality changes, should have no prefix.  These will not be added to the project change log.

Coding Guidelines
-----------------


Please follow the format guidelines that are saved in the project properties.

Windows users, please read this: http://help.github.com/line-endings/
The default line ending is **LF**.

To build all jars, select the EssentialsParent project and build that. You'll find all jars inside the jars folder.

Please only submit pull requests for the 2.x branch.

Bugs and issues can be submitted/found at https://essentials3.atlassian.net/


Other advice
-----------------

Not all features are 'Essentials Ready'.  Essentials is designed to cover the basic needs of Minecraft server administration, thus, we reject over 80% of feature requests that we deem are unsuitable.

Before developing an Essentials feature, we would recommend speaking to a developer in the Essentials IRC channel ([#essentials on irc.esper.net](http://tiny.cc/EssentialsChat)). Click [here](irc://irc.esper.net/#essentials) if you have a IRC client.

MESECONS by Jeija and contributors

Mezzee-what?
------------
[Mesecons](https://mesecons.net/)! They're yellow, they're conductive, and they'll add a whole new dimension to Minetest's gameplay.

Mesecons is a mod for [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) that implements a ton of items related to digital circuitry, such as wires, buttons, lights, and even programmable controllers. Among other things, there are also pistons, solar panels, pressure plates, and note blocks.

Mesecons has a similar goal to Redstone in Minecraft, but works in its own way, with different rules and mechanics.

OK, I want in.
--------------
Go get it!

[DOWNLOAD IT NOW](https://github.com/minetest-mods/mesecons/archive/master.zip)

Now go ahead and install it like any other Minetest mod. Don't know how? Check out [the wonderful page about it](https://wiki.minetest.net/Mods) over at the official Minetest Wiki. For your convenience, here's a quick summary:

1. If Mesecons is still in a ZIP file, extract the folder inside to somewhere on the computer.
2. Make sure that when you open the folder, you can directly find `README.md` in the listing. If you just see another folder, move that folder up one level and delete the old one.
3. Open up the Minetest mods folder - usually `/mods/`. If you see the `minetest` or folder inside of that, that is your mod folder instead.
4. Copy the Mesecons folder into the mods folder.

Don't like some parts of Mesecons? Open up the Mesecons folder and delete the subfolder containing the mod you don't want. If you didn't want movestones, for example, all you have to do is delete the `mesecons_movestones` folder and they will no longer be available.

There are no dependencies - it will work right after installing!

How do I use this thing?
------------------------
How about a [quick overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kmeQj6iW5k)?

Or maybe a [comprehensive reference](http://mesecons.net/items.html) is your style?

An overview for the very newest of new beginners? How does [this one](http://uberi.mesecons.net/projects/MeseconsBasics/index.html) look?

There is also a [wiki page](https://wiki.minetest.net/Mods/Mesecons) dedicated to this mod.

Want to get more into building? Why not check out the [Mesecons Laboratory](http://uberi.mesecons.net/), a website dedicated to advanced Mesecons builders?

Want to contribute to Mesecons itself? Check out the [source code](https://github.com/minetest-mods/mesecons)!

449,Cubitect/cubiomes,C,"# cubiomes

Cubiomes is a standalone library, written in C, that mimics the biome and feature generation of Minecraft Java Edition.
It is intended as a powerful tool to devise very fast, custom seed finding applications and large-scale map viewers with minimal memory usage.


#### Cubiomes-Viewer

If you want to get started without coding, there is now also a [graphical application](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer) based on this library.


#### Audience

You should be familiar with the C programming language. A basic understanding of the Minecraft biome generation process would also be helpful.


## Getting Started

This section is meant to give you a quick starting point with small example programs if you want to use this library to find your own biome dependent features.


### Biome Generator

Let's create a simple program called `find_biome_at.c` which tests seeds for a Mushroom Fields biome at a predefined location.

```C
// check the biome at a block position
#include ""generator.h""
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // Set up a biome generator that reflects the biome generation of
    // Minecraft 1.18.
    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, MC_1_18, 0);

    // Seeds are internally represented as unsigned 64-bit integers.
    uint64_t seed;
    for (seed = 0; ; seed++)
    {
        // Apply the seed to the generator for the Overworld dimension.
        applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

        // To get the biome at a single block position, we can use getBiomeAt().
        int scale = 1; // scale=1: block coordinates, scale=4: biome coordinates
        int x = 0, y = 63, z = 0;
        int biomeID = getBiomeAt(&g, scale, x, y, z);
        if (biomeID == mushroom_fields)
        {
            printf(""Seed %"" PRId64 "" has a Mushroom Fields biome at ""
                ""block position (%d, %d).\n"", (int64_t) seed, x, z);
            break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

You can compile this code either by directly adding a target to the makefile via
```
$ cd cubiomes
$ make libcubiomes
```
...or you can compile and link to a cubiomes archive using either of the following commands.
```
$ gcc find_biome_at.c libcubiomes.a -fwrapv -lm   # static
$ gcc find_biome_at.c -L. -lcubiomes -fwrapv -lm  # dynamic
```
Both commands assume that your source code is saved as `find_biome_at.c` in the cubiomes working directory. If your makefile is configured to use pthreads, you may also need to add the `-lpthread` option to the compiler.
The option `-fwrapv` enforces two's complement for signed integer overflow, which this library relies on. It is not strictly necessary for this example as the library should already be compiled with this flag, but it is good practice to prevent undefined behaviour.
Running the program should output:
```
$ ./a.out
Seed 262 has a Mushroom Fields biome at block position (0, 0).
```

### Biome Generation in a Range

We can also generate biomes for an area or volume using `genBiomes()`. This will utilize whatever optimizations are available for the generator and can be much faster than generating each position individually. (The layered generators for versions up to 1.17 will benefit significantly more from this than the noise-based ones.)

Before we can generate the biomes for an area or volume, we need to define the bounds with a `Range` structure and allocate the necessary buffer using `allocCache()`. The `Range` is described by a scale, position, and size, where each cell inside the `Range` represents `scale` many blocks in the horizontal axes. The vertical direction is treated separately and always follows the biome coordinate scaling of 1:4, with the exception of when `scale == 1`, in which case the vertical scaling is also 1:1.

The only supported values for `scale` are 1, 4, 16, 64, and (for the Overworld) 256. For versions up to 1.17, the scale is matched to an appropriate biome layer and will influence the biomes that can generate.

```C
// generate an image of the world
#include ""generator.h""
#include ""util.h""

int main()
{
    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, MC_1_18, LARGE_BIOMES);

    uint64_t seed = 123LL;
    applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

    Range r;
    // 1:16, a.k.a. horizontal chunk scaling
    r.scale = 16;
    // Define the position and size for a horizontal area:
    r.x = -60, r.z = -60;   // position (x,z)
    r.sx = 120, r.sz = 120; // size (width,height)
    // Set the vertical range as a plane near sea level at scale 1:4.
    r.y = 15, r.sy = 1;

    // Allocate the necessary cache for this range.
    int *biomeIds = allocCache(&g, r);

    // Generate the area inside biomeIds, indexed as:
    // biomeIds[i_y*r.sx*r.sz + i_z*r.sx + i_x]
    // where (i_x, i_y, i_z) is a position relative to the range cuboid.
    genBiomes(&g, biomeIds, r);

    // Map the biomes to an image buffer, with 4 pixels per biome cell.
    int pix4cell = 4;
    int imgWidth = pix4cell*r.sx, imgHeight = pix4cell*r.sz;
    unsigned char biomeColors[256][3];
    initBiomeColors(biomeColors);
    unsigned char *rgb = (unsigned char *) malloc(3*imgWidth*imgHeight);
    biomesToImage(rgb, biomeColors, biomeIds, r.sx, r.sz, pix4cell, 2);

    // Save the RGB buffer to a PPM image file.
    savePPM(""map.ppm"", rgb, imgWidth, imgHeight);

    // Clean up.
    free(biomeIds);
    free(rgb);

    return 0;
}
```


### Structure Generation

The generation of structures can usually be regarded as a two-stage process: generation attempts and biome checks. For most structures, Minecraft divides the world into a grid of regions (usually 32x32 chunks) and performs one generation attempt in each. We can use `getStructurePos()` to get the position of such a generation attempt, and then test whether a structure will actually generate there with `isViableStructurePos()`; however, this is more expensive to compute (requiring many microseconds instead of nanoseconds).

Note: some structures (in particular desert pyramids, jungle temples and woodland mansions) in 1.18 no longer depend solely on the biomes and can also fail to generate based on the surface height near the generation attempt. Unfortunately, cubiomes does not provide block level world generation and cannot check for this, and may therefore yield false positive positions. Support for an approximation for the surface height might be added in the future to improve accuracy.


```C
// find a seed with a certain structure at the origin chunk
#include ""finders.h""
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int structType = Outpost;
    int mc = MC_1_18;

    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);

    uint64_t lower48;
    for (lower48 = 0; ; lower48++)
    {
        // The structure position depends only on the region coordinates and
        // the lower 48-bits of the world seed.
        Pos p;
        if (!getStructurePos(structType, mc, lower48, 0, 0, &p))
            continue;

        // Look for a seed with the structure at the origin chunk.
        if (p.x >= 16 || p.z >= 16)
            continue;

        // Look for a full 64-bit seed with viable biomes.
        uint64_t upper16;
        for (upper16 = 0; upper16 < 0x10000; upper16++)
        {
            uint64_t seed = lower48 | (upper16 << 48);
            applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);
            if (isViableStructurePos(structType, &g, p.x, p.z, 0))
            {
                printf(""Seed %"" PRId64 "" has a Pillager Outpost at (%d, %d).\n"",
                    (int64_t) seed, p.x, p.z);
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Quad-Witch-Huts

A commonly desired feature are Quad-Witch-Huts or similar multi-structure clusters. To test for these types of seeds, we can look a little deeper into how the generation attempts are determined. Notice that the positions depend only on the structure type, region coordinates and the lower 48 bits of the seed. Also, once we have found a seed with the desired generation attemps, we can move them around by transforming the 48-bit seed using `moveStructure()`. This means there is a set of seed bases which can function as a starting point to generate all other seeds with similar structure placement.

The function `searchAll48()` can be used to find a complete set of 48-bit seed bases for a custom criterion. Given that in general it can take a very long time to check all 2^48 seeds (days or weeks), the function provides some functionality to save the results to disk which can be loaded again using `loadSavedSeeds()`. Luckily, it is possible in some cases to reduce the search space even further: for Swamp Huts and structures with a similar structure configuration, there are only a handful of constellations where the structures are close enough together to run simultaneously. Conveniently, these constellations differ uniquely at the lower 20 bits. (This is hard to prove, or at least I haven't found a rigorous proof that doesn't rely on brute forcing.) By specifying a list of lower 20-bit values, we can reduce the search space to the order of 2^28, which can be checked in a reasonable amount of time.


```C
// find seeds with a quad-witch-hut about the origin
#include ""quadbase.h""
#include <stdio.h>

int check(uint64_t s48, void *data)
{
    const StructureConfig sconf = *(const StructureConfig*) data;
    return isQuadBase(sconf, s48 - sconf.salt, 128);
}

int main()
{
    int styp = Swamp_Hut;
    int mc = MC_1_18;
    uint64_t basecnt = 0;
    uint64_t *bases = NULL;
    int threads = 8;
    Generator g;

    StructureConfig sconf;
    getStructureConfig(styp, mc, &sconf);

    printf(""Preparing seed bases...\n"");
    // Get all 48-bit quad-witch-hut bases, but consider only the best 20-bit
    // constellations where the structures are the closest together.
    int err = searchAll48(
        &bases, &basecnt, NULL, threads,
        low20QuadIdeal, sizeof(low20QuadIdeal) / sizeof(uint64_t), 20,
        check, &sconf
        );

    if (err || !bases)
    {
        printf(""Failed to generate seed bases.\n"");
        exit(1);
    }

    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);

    uint64_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < basecnt; i++)
    {
        // The quad bases by themselves have structures in regions (0,0)-(1,1)
        // so we can move them by -1 regions to have them around the origin.
        uint64_t s48 = moveStructure(bases[i] - sconf.salt, -1, -1);

        Pos pos[4];
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48, -1, -1, &pos[0]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48, -1,  0, &pos[1]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48,  0, -1, &pos[2]);
        getStructurePos(styp, mc, s48,  0,  0, &pos[3]);

        uint64_t high;
        for (high = 0; high < 0x10000; high++)
        {
            uint64_t seed = s48 | (high << 48);
            applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

            if (isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[0].x, pos[0].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[1].x, pos[1].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[2].x, pos[2].z, 0) &&
                isViableStructurePos(styp, &g, pos[3].x, pos[3].z, 0))
            {
                printf(""%"" PRId64 ""\n"", (int64_t) seed);
            }
        }
    }

    free(bases);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Strongholds and Spawn

Strongholds, as well as the world spawn point, actually search until they find a suitable location, rather than checking a single spot like most other structures. This causes them to be particularly performance expensive to find. Furthermore, the positions of strongholds have to be generated in a certain order, which can be done in an iterative fashion with `initFirstStronghold()` and `nextStronghold()`. For the world spawn, the generation starts with a search for a suitable biome near the origin, and will continue until a grass or podzol block is found. There is no reliable way to check actual blocks, so the search relies on a statistic, matching grass presence to biomes. Alternatively, we can simply use `estimateSpawn()` and terminate the search after the first biome check under the assumption that grass is nearby.


```C
// find spawn and the first N strongholds
#include ""finders.h""
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int mc = MC_1_18;
    uint64_t seed = 3055141959546LL;

    // Only the first stronghold has a position which can be estimated
    // (+/-112 blocks) without biome check.
    StrongholdIter sh;
    Pos pos = initFirstStronghold(&sh, mc, seed);

    printf(""Seed: %"" PRId64 ""\n"", (int64_t) seed);
    printf(""Estimated position of first stronghold: (%d, %d)\n"", pos.x, pos.z);

    Generator g;
    setupGenerator(&g, mc, 0);
    applySeed(&g, DIM_OVERWORLD, seed);

    pos = getSpawn(&g);
    printf(""Spawn: (%d, %d)\n"", pos.x, pos.z);

    int i, N = 12;
    for (i = 1; i <= N; i++)
    {
        if (nextStronghold(&sh, &g) <= 0)
            break;
        printf(""Stronghold #%-3d: (%6d, %6d)\n"", i, sh.pos.x, sh.pos.z);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

457,destruc7i0n/shulker,TypeScript,"# shulker

> Connects [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) and [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) Servers by sending messages back and forth without any mods or plugins.

## In Action
![discord-mc](http://i.thedestruc7i0n.ca/I5anbg.gif)

## Features
- Sends message to and from Vanilla Minecraft servers with no plugins or mods
- Can send messages regarding
  - Advancements
  - Players joining and leaving
  - Player deaths
- Webhooks for sending messages
- Allows members with specific roles to send commands to Minecraft through Discord
- Can be run on a remote machine or locally on the same machine (see `IS_LOCAL_FILE` in the options below)
 
## Installation

Ensure you have Node v16.6+ installed. You can check the version you have installed with `node -v` in your terminal or command prompt.

Create a Discord bot here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

* Important: Ensure that the Bot has the **Server Members Intent** and the **Message Content Intent** (available on the ""Bot"" tab in your Application settings)

Then, add the bot to your Discord server using the following link, replace the Client ID with that of your bot.
```
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT ID>&scope=bot
```

In your Minecraft server.properties, make sure you have the following and restart the server:
```
enable-rcon=true
rcon.password=<your password>
rcon.port=<1-65535>
```

Clone this repository onto a server, copy ```config.example.json``` to ```config.json```. And edit the following config fields:

Set `DISCORD_TOKEN` to the Discord Bot token that you created.

Set `MINECRAFT_SERVER_RCON_IP`, `MINECRAFT_SERVER_RCON_PORT`, and `MINECRAFT_SERVER_RCON_PASSWORD` to the ip, rcon port, and rcon password respectively for your server. (127.0.0.1 can be used if Shulker is running on the same server as your Minecraft server)

If you are running Shulker on the same server as your Minecraft server, set `IS_LOCAL_FILE` to `true` and update `LOCAL_FILE_PATH` to the full path to your Minecraft server's latest log file. (ex: `minecraft_server/logs/latest.log`)

If you want to have Shulker running on a remote server, see [Remote](#remote-setup) below.

With developer mode (Settings > Appearance > Developer Mode) enabled, right click the channel you wish to have Shulker send messages to and click ""Copy ID"". Set `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` to this value.

Create a webhook in the channel (Right click on channel > Edit Channel > Integrations > Create Webhook or New Webhook), copy it, and set `WEBHOOK_URL` to this value.

Finally, start Shulker.
```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

## FAQ
* How do I make this work on a modded server?
  - Try replacing `REGEX_SERVER_PREFIX` with `""\\[Server thread/INFO\\] \\[.*\\]:""`
  
* Why can't I send commands even if I have the option enabled?
  - Make sure that you have a role on the server which is put in the array `SLASH_COMMAND_ROLES_IDS`.
    - e.g. `""SLASH_COMMAND_ROLES_IDS"": [""<role id>""]`

* I am using a local file and no messages are being sent!
  - Enable `DEBUG` in the config to check for any errors.
  - If you are on Windows, try enabling `FS_WATCH_FILE`.

## Remote Setup

Perform the following command on the server hosting the Minecraft server (in a screen/tmux session or background process, make sure to replace your `YOUR_URL` with whatever URL you're using (`localhost:8000` if running on the same server and default config) and `PATH_TO_MINECRAFT_SERVER_INSTALL` with the path to the Minecraft server installation, such as `/usr/home/minecraft_server/`):

```sh
tail -F /PATH_TO_MINECRAFT_SERVER_INSTALL/logs/latest.log | grep --line-buffered "": <"" | while read x ; do echo -ne $x | curl -X POST -d @- http://YOUR_URL/minecraft/hook ; done
```
(The above command will also be given to you if you are not using a local file when you first start up Shulker)

## Upgrade Instructions
From version 2 to version 3:
- The main change is that you need to split your `REGEX_MATCH_CHAT_MC` to both `REGEX_MATCH_CHAT_MC` and `REGEX_SERVER_PREFIX`.
  See the [configuration](#configuration) above for details.

## Upcoming
None

===========

The premiere long-distance brush editor for [Sponge][Sponge].

Compilation
-----------

We use gradle to handle our dependencies.

- Check out this repository.
- Run ```./gradlew build```

The master branch is automatically build on our jenkins server ([VoxelSniper Jenkins Job][JenkinsJob]).

Issue Tracker Notes
-------------------

How do I create a ticket the right way?

- Seperate your reports. You think there is something wrong, but also want this new brush? Make life easier for us and create two tickets. We'd appriciate it big times.
- Don't tell us your story of life. We want facts and information. The more information about `the Problem` you give us, the easier it is for us to figure out what's wrong.
- Check the closed tickets first. Maybe someone created a similiar ticket already. If you think it's unresolved, then give us more information on there instead.

### Bug Report

Make sure to not tell us your story of life. We want brief descriptions of what's wrong to get directly to fixing.
Also try to make the title describe briefly what's wrong and attach things like logs or screenshots to help illustrate the issue further.

Here is an example, where an imaginary brush that should create a ball, creates a cube:

Title: `Brush A creates Cube instead of Ball`

```
Expected behaviour:
Brush A should create a ball with radius 5 when I set it to brush A with brush size 5.

Experienced behaviour:
Brush A created a cube instead.

Additional Information:
SpongeForge: 1.10.2-2052-5.0.0-BETA-1675
Minecraft Forge: 12.18.1.2057
VoxelSniper: 8.0.0
```

Additional Information like what java version the server runs on would be appriciated, but is not required at all times.

### Enhancement Request

This is where imagination comes in, but make sure to keep as it easy for us. As mentioned, we don't want your story of life. We want to know what you think would be a good enhancement.

Here is an example of an enhancement request.

Title: `Brush that creates lines`

```
Enhancement Proposal:
Creating a brush that creates a line.

Suggested usage:
You click two points with your arrow and it will create a line with blocks.

Reason of proposal:
It would be useful, since off angle lines are sometimes hard to make.
```

Keep in mind that those are guidelines.
We will still look into stuff that does not follow these guidlines, but it will give you an idea what we want in a ticket and make our life easier.

Pull Requests
-------------

We do accept pull requests and enhancements from third parties. Guidelines how to submit your pull requests properly and how to format your code will come.

Some rough guidelines for now:

- Keep the number of commits to a minimum. We want to look over the commit and basically see what you've done.
- Coding guidelines should try to comply to the checkstyle rules (checkstyle.xml) but not blindly. Use your mind to make smart decissions.
- Give us a good description to what you've done.
- Try to submit one change in one pull request and try to link it to the issue in the tracker if possible.

A master thesis project. Basically a Minecraft clone, I was focusing on accelerating things on GPU. There is a master thesis text in the repository, however it is in Czech. There's also a first few chapters of the english master thesis translated, then I lost the drive. I might eventually document some of the techniques on a blog or something.

Feel free to get inspired by the code. I'd be glad if you noticed me if you intend to use the code, no real limitations from my side, though. I probably won't be continuing on this project unless I get paid :D

Used texture pack: C-tetra by canna (under CC BY-NC 4.0 licence); downloaded from https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/16x-c-tetra-1-13/

## Minimum requirements
* GPU with GL 4.5+ (+ some ARBs, basically 4.6), 2 GB VRAM (4+ GB recommended)
* 2 GB available RAM (4+ GB recommended)

## Interesting technical stuff
1) Minecraft-like lighting system, but RGB and accelerated on GPU (light spread computing). Deferred shading. The way the model is designed results in a native ambient occlusion. (I'm sampling from a 3D light map texture, nodes are in centers of blocks, I offset the sampling position by half of the normal.
2) Block face aggergation. I am optimizing the rendered primitive count by aggregating neighbouring faces of blocks into one larger primitive. Calculation of this (together with calculation of which block faces are actually drawn) is done on GPU.
3) GPU-accelerated frustum culling.
4) Depth peeling (3 layers).
5) GPU-accelerated terrain generation. You program the generator on the CPU though (I have a wrapper for that). There are 2D/3D Perlin noise and Voronoi diagram thread cooperation shaders implemented. The generation is however quite slow, loading from a disc is like 10x faster and does not lag the game.
6) Even though a lot of stuff is accelerated on the GPU, you can still have custom block shapes and have practically a full control from CPU.
7) You can go to view distances up to 64 chunks and it still works quite well if you have a decent graphics card (you'll need 6 GB of VRAM for that though).
8) Memory requirements: 4 B per block on both RAM and VRAM. Chunk size is the same as in Minecraft.
9) I'm storing the save game in a SQLite database, which works quite well (compressed with zlib).

## How to build
There are Windows x64 and x86 binaries in the repository. It should compile on Linux, however there seems to be some problems.

1) Install a D compiler (preferably `dmd`, http://dlang.org, `sudo apt-get install dmd-compiler`)
2) (Already done for you for Windows) Download appropriate CSFML binaries from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/ (version 2.4; or build them, whatever makes you comfy).
3) (Already done for you for Windows) Put the shared libraries in the bin_XX folder & the static libraries in the lib_XX folder  (the XX is for example x86, x86_64 or so depending on the architecture).
4) (Already done for you for Windows) Download official sqlite3 binaries, put the dll in the bin_XX folder. For windows, generate .lib file to the lib_xx folder from the .dll using the implib tool downloaded here: https://digitalmars.com/download/freecompiler.html (basic utilites); command: `implib /system sqlite3.lib sqlite3.dll` ( https://digitalmars.com/ctg/implib.html ). Alternatively, you can download it from here: https://github.com/buggins/ddbc/tree/master/libs (Also already present for windows)
5) Run `dub build --build=release --arch=x86_64` (or without the `--arch=x86_64` for x86 build) in the root project folder (where dub.sdl is)
6) A binary should appear in the bin_XX folder"

##### January 23rd, 2022

**This repository has been archived** as we do not have the time or resources needed to maintain the project. No further updates will be published, and
we won't be providing help for using it.

If you are looking for a replacement, consider taking a look at [FerriteCore](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ferritecore-fabric), as it
generally offers more significant improvements to memory usage in modded scenarios and is currently available for the latest version of Minecraft.

# Hydrogen (for Fabric)
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jellysquid3/hydrogen-fabric.svg)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/jellysquid3/hydrogen-fabric.svg)
![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/jellysquid3/hydrogen-fabric.svg)

Hydrogen is a free and open-source mod designed to reduce the game's memory requirements by implementing more
memory-efficient data structures and logic. It's primarily designed for more heavily modded scenarios, but can
offer (small) improvements even in lightly modded or vanilla scenarios.

The mod works on both the **client and server**, and **doesn't require the mod to be installed
on both sides**. However, the benefits of running Hydrogen on the server are pretty small as of the moment.

#### Why are these patches not in [Lithium](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric)?

Hydrogen relies on rather egregious hacks in order to load some code into the game, primarily because the Guava
library developers really do not want people re-implementing their interfaces. These hacks are ""safe"" in the sense
that the game will simply fail to start if a problem occurs, but are really rather not suitable for the standards
which Lithium intends to promote. In other words, this mod could be looked at as ""things too dirty to put in Lithium.""

### Installation instructions

Hydrogen relies on the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). Users should select Fabric for either the Minecraft launcher (client) or
the dedicated server (server) depending on their needs.
Once you have installed Fabric, place the Hydrogen .jar in the `mods` folder generated by Fabric.

### Community

If you'd like to get help with the mod, check out the latest developments, or be notified when there's a new release,
the Discord community might be for you! You can join the official server for my mods by clicking
[here](https://jellysquid.me/discord).

### Building from source

If you're hacking on the code or would like to compile a custom build of Hydrogen from the latest sources, you'll want
to start here.

#### Prerequisites

You will need to install JDK 8 in order to build Hydrogen. You can either install this through a package manager such as
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows or [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) on other platforms. If you'd prefer to
not use a package manager, you can always grab the installers or packages directly from
[AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

On Windows, the Oracle JDK/JRE builds should be avoided where possible due to their poor quality. Always prefer using
the open-source builds from AdoptOpenJDK when possible.

#### Compiling

Navigate to the directory you've cloned this repository and launch a build with Gradle using `gradlew build` (Windows)
or `./gradlew build` (macOS/Linux). If you are not using the Gradle wrapper, simply replace `gradlew` with `gradle`
or the path to it.

The initial setup may take a few minutes. After Gradle has finished building everything, you can find the resulting
artifacts in `build/libs`.

### License

Minecraft multipurpose bot

This project are based on <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer"">mineflayer</a> & PrismarineJS repository

This program is part of the 3 of this project,
Each part can be run independently,
The other 2 parts are <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegionWebServer"">minecraftLegionWebServer</a> & <a href=""https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegionWebClient"">minecraftLegionWebClient</a>

I recommend using the other two modules to help the bots communicate and take commands through the WebUI.

## Watch the videos so you can see what it can do for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIz6o7cJITg&list=PLPwIRDkD3kwSdQ04LnzcGrLrlST9XoKjk&index=5

## Install with docker

1. You need to have installed [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/), you can go to official docker site and follow the installation guide for you OS
2. Create docker network if you have all services in same computer and if you not have already created

```
docker network create minecraftLegionNetwork
```

3. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegion.git
cd minecraftLegion
```

4. Copy and edit the config.js file

```js
 cp config_example.js config.js

 const config = {
  server: '127.0.0.1', // Minecraft Server
  port: '25565', // Minecraft Port
  masters: [{ name: 'PlayerName' }, { name: 'SecondPlayerName' }], // Optional when front end is not opened
  webServer: 'http://minecraftlegionwebserver', // host minecraftLegionWebServer Web, if is in docker locak you must use a default config
  webServerPort: '4001', // minecraftLegionWebServer PORT
  webServerPassword: 'admin', // password for websocket
  debugMode: false,
  customStart: false, // If server have a login or other system to play you can add your self start Ex: login pass pass (see custom_start/custom_example.js)
  autoRestart: true // When bot breaks they auto reconnect
}
module.exports = config

```

5. Start docker with node

```
docker run --rm -it --name minecraftLegion  --network minecraftLegionNetwork -v $PWD:/home/app -w /home/app -u node -p 4500-4550:4500-4550 -p 9229:9229 node:16.13-bullseye /bin/bash
```

6. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

7. Start connection to server

```
node index.js
```

Now you can manage the bots via front end

Click on Load New Bot and select name (password is not working for now)

For download and install frontend go to <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegionWebClient"">minecraftLegionWebClient</a>

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegion/master/docs/LoadBot.png)

## Next usages
For start again the bot only you need to start docker and start the node:
```
docker run --rm -it --name minecraftLegion  --network minecraftLegionNetwork -v $PWD:/home/app -w /home/app -u node -p 4500-4550:4500-4550 -p 9229:9229 node:16.13-bullseye /bin/bash
```

```
node index.js
```

## Manual update
You need to ""pull"" the new code and install the new dependencies

```
git pull
```
Start docker:

```
docker run --rm -it --name minecraftLegion  --network minecraftLegionNetwork -v $PWD:/home/app -w /home/app -u node -p 4500-4550:4500-4550 -p 9229:9229 node:16.13-bullseye /bin/bash
```
Install new dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Start bot
```
node index.js
```

# Usage of commands in chat:

**There only are the basic comands for full manage you must need to use a front end <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegionWebClient"">minecraftLegionWebClient</a>**

First, activate the bot attention ""hi namebot"" or ""hi all"" to start all bots simultaneously.

- `hi nameBot`

Make the bot/s follow you.

- `come`

Make the bot/s stand in the current position.

- `stay`

Start memorizing the positions used to save the way to chests or patrol (get the bots to follow you around)

- `set start way`

Save patrol, used for guard job (use command `set start way` before this one)

- `set save patrol`

For set max distance to attack mobs or players

- `set distance 30`

For set mode (pvp / pve / none), if bots are connected to minecraftLegionWebServer it wont attack other bots

- `set mode pvp`

Set job (Currently only finished Guard)

- `set job guard`

To help other bots in combat (need use minecraftLegionWebServer)

- `set help true`

to finish commands

- `bye`

For mining xyz_start xyz_end start_horientantion vertically / horizontalle
set miner x y z x y z x+ horizontally

# Current Jobs

- Guard
  - Do a patrol for look near enemies
- Miner
  - Make a tunel or hole
- Farmer
  - Do placing plants and sapling trees
  - Potatoes, Carrots, Wheat, Melon, Pumpkin, Sweet berries..
  - Sapling Trees -> Woodcutter
- Breeder
  - Feed animals! all types!
  - When there is surplus, sacrifice the surplus
- Sorter Job
  - The bot search all nearest chest and they sort all items based on ID item
  - Also send to the server and other bots you have in each chest, NOW ALL BOTS GO DIRECTLY TO THE CHEST THAT STORES THE ITEM!

# TODO

- Optimize Sorter Job, need too many interaction with chests for sort all the items
- Add custom Sort Items in chest, based on... any idea?
- Add more behavior into Sorter Job, -> Craft items? if detect in chests no have enough of XXX items then craft it if they can? (Example swords?)
- Make an Archer Job ( During how to have this behavior similar to guard job? )
- Optimize combat Guard Job ( combat creepers, PVP, destroy shields)
- Check day/night for sleep any sleep function? Add ""general config"" for send all bots to sleep for all jobs
- Add Job builder! based on mineflayer-builder & Schematichs
- Add placing torchs
- Check some bugs with mining job when have a too many lava or water
- Add a robust documentation =P
- Think about chat commands, currently it is faster / comfortable with the front end, but if anyone wants to configure all boot via chat commands?
- Add back guard
- Add ""world"" for the position, now the bots don't know if chest or positions is in nether / overworld / end, they breaks when is corring the portals

* Update mineflayer verion to latest

Please keep calm. I'm working hard on this project :D

# Minecraft Bedrock Edition Server
Made with ❤️ by Deb

## What Is It?

This is a smart and easy to use wrapper around the [Minecraft Bedrock Edition server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/) that automatically backs up to local storage and (optionally) Amazon S3 at regular intervals. Note that the server software that this wraps is, as of the time of writing, currently in alpha.

![2 Players](readme-assets/2-players.png)

### Bedrock Edition vs. Java Edition
This is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition server, so it is designed to be connected to using the cross platform compatible Windows 10, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Pocket editions of Minecraft, with a little luck. Though connecting to arbitrary servers (such as those set up using this software) from editions that are not the Windows 10 edition is not officially supported, there is a workaround that I tested that worked pretty well on Nintendo Switch, and which should(?) also work for other versions. (see the **Connecting from not Windows 10** section for info on how to do this)

[Official list of different Minecraft editions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034753992-Different-Minecraft-Editions)

### Who it's for
This is great for people who want to play online with their friends across different platforms using the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft, especially if they do not want to pay for a Minecraft Realms server and have a computer that they can turn on whenever they want to play to run the server.

If you're tech savvy enough, you could probably deploy this Node app to the cloud without much trouble, as long as the machine you're running it on has enough power to run a Minecraft server.

If you have the hardware and internet bandwidth, you can even go beyond the max number of players supported by a realms server, by tweaking the values in the config file. You can likely also go beyond the world size limit for a realms server (5GB as of the time of writing) - just be careful to keep an eye on your internet usage and backup configuration.

I've been playing with my friends, and this works great with our (relatively) small world sizes, giving us peace of mind since it periodically backs up our world in case we run into bugs in Mojang's alpha server software.

### Who it's not for
This server software is not designed to support dozens upon dozens of users, or for worlds whose sizes may expand to the order of gigabytes, since depending on your network connection, periodic backups may not work as well with large world sizes, even if your system's hardware can keep up. Furthermore, it has been written to be as easy as possible to get up and running and so does not have support for more advanced server features. Finally, Mojang's publicly released server software is (as of the time of writing) still in alpha, and therefore is inherently more prone to bugs. You can try, and there's a good chance it would work, given that it is running on a machine with sufficient hardware and network bandwidth, but do not be surprised if it does not.

## Setting It Up
![Getting Started](readme-assets/getting-started.png)

### System requirements
- A computer with internet access running [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/) or later, or Windows 10
  - An operating system which is based on Ubuntu 18.04 (such as [Linux Mint 19.3](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php)) also works
  - ~~Mojang also has a Windows 10 version of the alpha server software, but as of the time of writing, running this software on Windows 10 is not supported due to [broken backup functionality in the Windows 10 version of Mojang's software](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-2733)~~
  - There are, as of yet, no hard guidelines on the specs you'll need, but many entry level modern desktop computers should be able to support a handful of concurrent players. Don't quote me on this, though; Googling around is probably the way to go if you're worried about system requirements.
- You'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on this computer
  - You'll also need npm, which should be installed alongside Node.js if you install it using default settings
  - The earliest version of Node.js that I tested with was version 12.16.2
- You'll need to be able to access and enable port forwarding on your router if you want friends to join
  - I'll link a tutorial for this further down
- Finally, everyone who wants to join the server (even you) will need Minecraft Bedrock Edition and a Microsoft account to login and play online. Since no official Linux client exists for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, you won't be able to connect to the server from the same computer you're running it on, barring any virtual machine shenanigans

#### Optional requirements
These aren't really necessary, but make things much nicer
- A domain that your friends can connect to (I created a subdomain on a domain I already owned) so you don't have to have your IP address floating around in people's inboxes
- An [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) account so the server can automatically store backups to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

### Reading Minecraft's EULA
By using this software, you are agreeing to the official Minecraft [End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/), since this software automatically download's Mojang's software when you first run it.

### Downloading the code
Download and unzip the code from GitHub, or clone the repository. Make sure the code is in the directory where you want your world and local backups to live.

### Config file
Rename the `EXAMPLE_config.json` file to `config.json` and delete the comment lines at the top of the file. Then, change the values you want to change:
| Value | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `accept-official-minecraft-server-eula` | Whether or not you agree to the official Minecraft [End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/). **You must agree by setting this to true in order to run this software** |
|`minecraft-server-version`|The version of [Mojang's server software](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/) that will be downloaded and used. The default value of this is the latest version I've tested with, though you should theoretically be able to update this if you run into issues. Be careful about updating though, since Mojang may break some backwards compatiblity. If you update this and run `npm start` the software will try to download the server version you specify, though it won't delete the old version just in case.|
| `server-properties` | These are the base properties that define server behavior. Most should be self explanatory, but you can find more detailed descriptions [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#Bedrock_Edition_3). **Be careful about changing the server and level names after you've run the server, since this may mess up how the server locates backups** |
|`ui`|You can optionally set the `enabled` flag here to `true` in order to run a web based UI for basic server managing on the specified `port`. If you do so, you'll need to set `admin-code-sha256-hash` to the [sha256](https://xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator) hash of the code that needs to be entered in order to access the UI. Please be careful when sharing this and keep general password hygiene in mind.|
|`backup`|See the **The Backup System** section further down this page for more details on how this works|

### Amazon S3 cloud backups (optional)
If you want your backups to also be stored remotely, you'll need to set up the AWS connection:
1. Sign up for an [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) account, and make sure you can access the [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) console.
2. Set up your AWS credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` using the first step of [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html). It is highly recommended that you create an IAM user with access to only S3.
3. Set `use-aws-s3-backup` under the `backup` field of the `config.json` file to true.
4. Read the **The Backup System** section further down this page for more details on how the backup logic works. This is highly recommended if you're using Amazon S3 backups since tweaking the settings described there will affect the way your S3 storage is used.

**Warning: Keep an eye on the sizes of the backups that are uploaded to the S3 bucket - Minecraft worlds start out pretty small, but can become quite large, so uploading and downloading backups frequently could get expensive if things get too crazy. So far, I haven't had problems with my smallish world, but you can never be too careful. The software can be set up to automatically purge old backups, as is described further down this guide.**

### Starting the server
Since this is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) application, after you download the code, you need to run the following command from the terminal within the directory you installed it to:
`npm install`

After that, you can start the server with the following command:
`npm start`

You don't need to rerun `npm install` every time you run the server, just `npm start`

### Stopping the server
**DO NOT use Ctrl+C/termination/kill commands to stop the server**

The server has built in protections to restore the state of your world if it is killed in a non graceful manner or something else bad happens (that's what the backups are for), but you may lose all progress since your last save.

In order to properly stop the server, type in the following command:
`stop`

### Connecting to the server

#### Connecting to the UI
If you've enabled backups in the UI section of the config file, you can access the web UI on the port you've defined in the UI section, so if your UI port is `3000`, you'll be able to access the UI on the machine you're running the server on at `localhost:3000` in your browser. If you want other people to be able to access this admin UI, you can forward this port using the information in the next section, but be careful when doing this - while the UI has some protection against stuff like replay attacks, and every change request needs to be authenticated, the server does not (yet) have a UI killswitch or other mechanism to protect against repeated password guesses. Also avoid sharing the UI if you don't want other people to see stuff like the terminal ouput for the server, or a list of backups, since these requests do not require an admin code.

The UI allows you to monitor stuff such as recent server output and performance. You can also view connected players, manually create backups, restore backups, stop the server, etc.

#### Port forwarding/IP stuff
Take a note of the `server-port` field that you set under `server-properties` in `config.json`. This is the port that the server will listen on once you set up port forwarding, and you'll need to give this to anyone who wants to connect to it. The default value for this is `19132`.

First, you need to figure out what your machine's IP address within your local network is. I found mine using the `ifconfig` command in the terminal, but if that doesn't work, a little bit of Googling should help you find it. It's usually something like `192.168.(something).(something)`

Once you have your port, and the internal IP address of your machine, you need to set up port forwarding on your router. This can vary from router to router, but shouldn't be too tricky - I recommend Googling how to do this. You want to associate the port that your server will listen on to your machine's local ip address.

Also take a note of your external IP address - Googling 'what is my ip' will give this to you. (Google gives it to you within the search results page). If you don't link a domain, you'll have to give this to your friends so they can connect to your server, so be extremely careful who you share this with (also be very careful about who you share the domain with).

#### Linking a domain (optional)
Once again, Google will likely give you a much more comprehensive tutorial on how to do this than I can here. My domain is connected to Cloudflare, so I used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xfsH7bmSFc) to link my domain, though it should help even if you don't use Cloudflare. Note that when the tutorial says you should enter your ip address and port, you should use the external ip address you found by Googling, and the port you set in the config file. Once again, be extremely careful who you share this domain with.

#### Connecting from the Windows 10 Edition
Connecting from the Windows 10 edition is thankfully pretty easy

Open Minecraft, make sure you're logged in to your Microsoft account, and navigate to the 'servers' tab. Once there, you'll need to add your server.

- **Server Name**: I don't think the server name you enter matters, so enter whatever you like here
- **Server Address**: This depends on where you're connecting from, and whether or not you've linked your server to a domain
  - If you're on the same network as your server, enter your server's local ip address (the one you found with `ifconfig`) when setting up port forwarding
  - If you're on a different network (this is likely the case for your friends) and you don't have a linked domain, then you'll need to enter your external ip address you found through Google (having a linked domain is recommended, but if you do not have one, please be very careful about who you give out your ip to)
  - If you're on a different network and you do have a linked domain, just enter the domain
- **Port**: The port entered in `server-port` under the `server-properties` field of `config.json` (the default value for this is `19132`)

#### Connecting from the not Windows 10 Editon
If you're not using the Windows 10 Edition, you may still be able to connect. Try the same steps as the **Connecting from the Windows 10 Edition** section, and if that doesn't work, try [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalT_oR1nPM) to change your DNS to the BedrockConnect DNS followed by the Windows 10 connection steps again. The tutorial is designed for Switch, but following more or less the same steps should work for Xbox One if you're lucky. If not, once again, Google is your friend.

## The Backup System
![Redstone](readme-assets/redstone.png)

The `backup` field in the `config.json` file defines how the server behaves with regard to creating backups.

All backups are stored in the `backups` folder as zip files with the timestamp of the backup followed by the type of the backup. If `use-aws-s3-backup` is set to true, backups will also be synced to an Amazon S3 bucket.

### Types of backups

There are 4 types of backups that can be created by the server:

| Backup Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `SCHEDULED` | These types of backups are periodically created by the server at regular intervals, according to the value defined in `backup-frequency-minutes`. Be careful not to make this too small if your world size grows or as the time it takes to create backups increases, scheduled backups may overlap. If you keep the default value, this is unlikely to happen unless your world is very large and/or your internet is very slow. |
| `MANUAL` | Typing in the `backup` command causes one of these backups to be created. |
|`ON_STOP`| One of these backups is created every time the server is gracefully stopped using the `stop` command |
|`ON_FORCED_STOP`| If the server is killed ungracefully, it will try to create one of these types of backups. This is more like a 'last resort' that may also help with debugging. These backups are very sketchy and due to the nature of forced stops they could be incomplete, corrupted, or not uploaded to Amazon S3 properly. |

### Remote Backups

Whenever a backup is created, if `use-aws-s3-backup` is set to true, the software uploads (or in the case of `ON_FORCED_STOP` backups, attempts to upload) the backup to an Amazon S3 bucket for the account you set up.

### Restoring backups

Whenever the server starts, if `use-aws-s3-backup` is set to true, the latest backups according to creation time will be retrieved from Amazon S3 and added to the directory of local backups. After that, the latest backup that is not of the type `ON_FORCED_STOP` will be used to replace the state of the world on the server before starting the server. (so non backed up data will be lost) If the server is always shut down correctly, then this backup will always of the type `ON_STOP`.

**Warning: It's a good idea to make sure your computer's time is synced and consistent so the correct backups are always retrieved and restored**

If you want to restore a specific backup to the server when it is running, you can use the `force-restore <BACKUP_FILE_NAME>` command, which will create a separate backup of the current server state, gracefully stop the server, restore the backup you specified, and restart the server. You can also do this from the UI pretty easily.

This is also useful if you want to import your existing world into the server. Just make sure your level name matches the one in your config and create a zip file with your level (a folder matching the level name) at the root. Then name your zip file something you'll recognize, drop it into the `backups` folder and restore it either from the UI or the terminal. If you're unsure about the format, you can look at some of the backups the server creates on its own.

### Automatic purging of old backups

For both local, and remote backups, the software only keeps a limited number of backups, deleting the oldest ones once new ones are created. How many backups to keep is determined on a per type basis based on the values in `num-backups-to-keep-for-type`. Setting one of these values to `-1` means old backups of that type will never be deleted.

## Known issues
### Still in alpha

Mojang's server software, which this software uses, is still in alpha, so it could be buggy. One of my motivations for writing this software was so that the automatic backups could protect me from losing information due to bugs in the alpha server software. It's worked great for me and my friends so far, but as always, please be somewhat careful.

### ~~Windows incompatibilities~~ (Seemingly fixed)
~~The software currently only supports Ubuntu 18.04+ as of now, though a Windows 10 version of Mojang's server software does exist. This is because there is [an issue with the last version I checked that prevents backups from being effectively created](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-2733). This is kind of annoying since it means you can't run the server and connect to it from the same computer, barring virtual machines (Minecraft Bedrock Edition is available on Windows 10 but not Ubuntu). If the backup issue is fixed, and I get the time, lmk and I will add Windows 10 support so you don't need the extra machine and OS.~~
This issue seems to have been fixed somewhere around Mojang's server version `1.16.201.02`, and my testing seems fine so I've enabled Windows support in this repo. Lmk if you run into any issues.

### Scaling issues?
I wouldn't recommend using this server to host dozens upon dozens of clients. It might work well given the correct configuration values, hardware, and network bandwidth, but I haven't done any large scale tests, so attempt this at your own peril.

## Disclaimer
Please read the license for this repository. I am not responsible for any hardware/software/financial?/legal? problems, lost worlds, or any other issues that may arise when using this software. If you do lose information, however, I could help you if you open a GitHub issue, though once again I am not responsible for anything that may go wrong when attempting recovery.

If you do find a bug, opening an issue on GitHub would be great - as I've mentioned earlier, I play with my friends on a server running this software very often, so making the experience better for me, them, and anyone else who uses it is always a win.

# Minecraft Bedrock Edition Server
Made with ❤️ by Deb

## What Is It?

This is a smart and easy to use wrapper around the [Minecraft Bedrock Edition server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/) that automatically backs up to local storage and (optionally) Amazon S3 at regular intervals. Note that the server software that this wraps is, as of the time of writing, currently in alpha.

![2 Players](readme-assets/2-players.png)

### Bedrock Edition vs. Java Edition
This is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition server, so it is designed to be connected to using the cross platform compatible Windows 10, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Pocket editions of Minecraft, with a little luck. Though connecting to arbitrary servers (such as those set up using this software) from editions that are not the Windows 10 edition is not officially supported, there is a workaround that I tested that worked pretty well on Nintendo Switch, and which should(?) also work for other versions. (see the **Connecting from not Windows 10** section for info on how to do this)

[Official list of different Minecraft editions](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034753992-Different-Minecraft-Editions)

### Who it's for
This is great for people who want to play online with their friends across different platforms using the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft, especially if they do not want to pay for a Minecraft Realms server and have a computer that they can turn on whenever they want to play to run the server.

If you're tech savvy enough, you could probably deploy this Node app to the cloud without much trouble, as long as the machine you're running it on has enough power to run a Minecraft server.

If you have the hardware and internet bandwidth, you can even go beyond the max number of players supported by a realms server, by tweaking the values in the config file. You can likely also go beyond the world size limit for a realms server (5GB as of the time of writing) - just be careful to keep an eye on your internet usage and backup configuration.

I've been playing with my friends, and this works great with our (relatively) small world sizes, giving us peace of mind since it periodically backs up our world in case we run into bugs in Mojang's alpha server software.

### Who it's not for
This server software is not designed to support dozens upon dozens of users, or for worlds whose sizes may expand to the order of gigabytes, since depending on your network connection, periodic backups may not work as well with large world sizes, even if your system's hardware can keep up. Furthermore, it has been written to be as easy as possible to get up and running and so does not have support for more advanced server features. Finally, Mojang's publicly released server software is (as of the time of writing) still in alpha, and therefore is inherently more prone to bugs. You can try, and there's a good chance it would work, given that it is running on a machine with sufficient hardware and network bandwidth, but do not be surprised if it does not.

## Setting It Up
![Getting Started](readme-assets/getting-started.png)

### System requirements
- A computer with internet access running [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/) or later, or Windows 10
  - An operating system which is based on Ubuntu 18.04 (such as [Linux Mint 19.3](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php)) also works
  - ~~Mojang also has a Windows 10 version of the alpha server software, but as of the time of writing, running this software on Windows 10 is not supported due to [broken backup functionality in the Windows 10 version of Mojang's software](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-2733)~~
  - There are, as of yet, no hard guidelines on the specs you'll need, but many entry level modern desktop computers should be able to support a handful of concurrent players. Don't quote me on this, though; Googling around is probably the way to go if you're worried about system requirements.
- You'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on this computer
  - You'll also need npm, which should be installed alongside Node.js if you install it using default settings
  - The earliest version of Node.js that I tested with was version 12.16.2
- You'll need to be able to access and enable port forwarding on your router if you want friends to join
  - I'll link a tutorial for this further down
- Finally, everyone who wants to join the server (even you) will need Minecraft Bedrock Edition and a Microsoft account to login and play online. Since no official Linux client exists for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, you won't be able to connect to the server from the same computer you're running it on, barring any virtual machine shenanigans

#### Optional requirements
These aren't really necessary, but make things much nicer
- A domain that your friends can connect to (I created a subdomain on a domain I already owned) so you don't have to have your IP address floating around in people's inboxes
- An [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) account so the server can automatically store backups to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

### Reading Minecraft's EULA
By using this software, you are agreeing to the official Minecraft [End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/), since this software automatically download's Mojang's software when you first run it.

### Downloading the code
Download and unzip the code from GitHub, or clone the repository. Make sure the code is in the directory where you want your world and local backups to live.

### Config file
Rename the `EXAMPLE_config.json` file to `config.json` and delete the comment lines at the top of the file. Then, change the values you want to change:
| Value | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `accept-official-minecraft-server-eula` | Whether or not you agree to the official Minecraft [End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/). **You must agree by setting this to true in order to run this software** |
|`minecraft-server-version`|The version of [Mojang's server software](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/) that will be downloaded and used. The default value of this is the latest version I've tested with, though you should theoretically be able to update this if you run into issues. Be careful about updating though, since Mojang may break some backwards compatiblity. If you update this and run `npm start` the software will try to download the server version you specify, though it won't delete the old version just in case.|
| `server-properties` | These are the base properties that define server behavior. Most should be self explanatory, but you can find more detailed descriptions [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#Bedrock_Edition_3). **Be careful about changing the server and level names after you've run the server, since this may mess up how the server locates backups** |
|`ui`|You can optionally set the `enabled` flag here to `true` in order to run a web based UI for basic server managing on the specified `port`. If you do so, you'll need to set `admin-code-sha256-hash` to the [sha256](https://xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator) hash of the code that needs to be entered in order to access the UI. Please be careful when sharing this and keep general password hygiene in mind.|
|`backup`|See the **The Backup System** section further down this page for more details on how this works|

### Amazon S3 cloud backups (optional)
If you want your backups to also be stored remotely, you'll need to set up the AWS connection:
1. Sign up for an [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) account, and make sure you can access the [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) console.
2. Set up your AWS credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` using the first step of [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html). It is highly recommended that you create an IAM user with access to only S3.
3. Set `use-aws-s3-backup` under the `backup` field of the `config.json` file to true.
4. Read the **The Backup System** section further down this page for more details on how the backup logic works. This is highly recommended if you're using Amazon S3 backups since tweaking the settings described there will affect the way your S3 storage is used.

**Warning: Keep an eye on the sizes of the backups that are uploaded to the S3 bucket - Minecraft worlds start out pretty small, but can become quite large, so uploading and downloading backups frequently could get expensive if things get too crazy. So far, I haven't had problems with my smallish world, but you can never be too careful. The software can be set up to automatically purge old backups, as is described further down this guide.**

### Starting the server
Since this is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) application, after you download the code, you need to run the following command from the terminal within the directory you installed it to:
`npm install`

After that, you can start the server with the following command:
`npm start`

You don't need to rerun `npm install` every time you run the server, just `npm start`

### Stopping the server
**DO NOT use Ctrl+C/termination/kill commands to stop the server**

The server has built in protections to restore the state of your world if it is killed in a non graceful manner or something else bad happens (that's what the backups are for), but you may lose all progress since your last save.

In order to properly stop the server, type in the following command:
`stop`

### Connecting to the server

#### Connecting to the UI
If you've enabled backups in the UI section of the config file, you can access the web UI on the port you've defined in the UI section, so if your UI port is `3000`, you'll be able to access the UI on the machine you're running the server on at `localhost:3000` in your browser. If you want other people to be able to access this admin UI, you can forward this port using the information in the next section, but be careful when doing this - while the UI has some protection against stuff like replay attacks, and every change request needs to be authenticated, the server does not (yet) have a UI killswitch or other mechanism to protect against repeated password guesses. Also avoid sharing the UI if you don't want other people to see stuff like the terminal ouput for the server, or a list of backups, since these requests do not require an admin code.

The UI allows you to monitor stuff such as recent server output and performance. You can also view connected players, manually create backups, restore backups, stop the server, etc.

#### Port forwarding/IP stuff
Take a note of the `server-port` field that you set under `server-properties` in `config.json`. This is the port that the server will listen on once you set up port forwarding, and you'll need to give this to anyone who wants to connect to it. The default value for this is `19132`.

First, you need to figure out what your machine's IP address within your local network is. I found mine using the `ifconfig` command in the terminal, but if that doesn't work, a little bit of Googling should help you find it. It's usually something like `192.168.(something).(something)`

Once you have your port, and the internal IP address of your machine, you need to set up port forwarding on your router. This can vary from router to router, but shouldn't be too tricky - I recommend Googling how to do this. You want to associate the port that your server will listen on to your machine's local ip address.

Also take a note of your external IP address - Googling 'what is my ip' will give this to you. (Google gives it to you within the search results page). If you don't link a domain, you'll have to give this to your friends so they can connect to your server, so be extremely careful who you share this with (also be very careful about who you share the domain with).

#### Linking a domain (optional)
Once again, Google will likely give you a much more comprehensive tutorial on how to do this than I can here. My domain is connected to Cloudflare, so I used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xfsH7bmSFc) to link my domain, though it should help even if you don't use Cloudflare. Note that when the tutorial says you should enter your ip address and port, you should use the external ip address you found by Googling, and the port you set in the config file. Once again, be extremely careful who you share this domain with.

#### Connecting from the Windows 10 Edition
Connecting from the Windows 10 edition is thankfully pretty easy

Open Minecraft, make sure you're logged in to your Microsoft account, and navigate to the 'servers' tab. Once there, you'll need to add your server.

- **Server Name**: I don't think the server name you enter matters, so enter whatever you like here
- **Server Address**: This depends on where you're connecting from, and whether or not you've linked your server to a domain
  - If you're on the same network as your server, enter your server's local ip address (the one you found with `ifconfig`) when setting up port forwarding
  - If you're on a different network (this is likely the case for your friends) and you don't have a linked domain, then you'll need to enter your external ip address you found through Google (having a linked domain is recommended, but if you do not have one, please be very careful about who you give out your ip to)
  - If you're on a different network and you do have a linked domain, just enter the domain
- **Port**: The port entered in `server-port` under the `server-properties` field of `config.json` (the default value for this is `19132`)

#### Connecting from the not Windows 10 Editon
If you're not using the Windows 10 Edition, you may still be able to connect. Try the same steps as the **Connecting from the Windows 10 Edition** section, and if that doesn't work, try [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalT_oR1nPM) to change your DNS to the BedrockConnect DNS followed by the Windows 10 connection steps again. The tutorial is designed for Switch, but following more or less the same steps should work for Xbox One if you're lucky. If not, once again, Google is your friend.

## The Backup System
![Redstone](readme-assets/redstone.png)

The `backup` field in the `config.json` file defines how the server behaves with regard to creating backups.

All backups are stored in the `backups` folder as zip files with the timestamp of the backup followed by the type of the backup. If `use-aws-s3-backup` is set to true, backups will also be synced to an Amazon S3 bucket.

### Types of backups

There are 4 types of backups that can be created by the server:

| Backup Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `SCHEDULED` | These types of backups are periodically created by the server at regular intervals, according to the value defined in `backup-frequency-minutes`. Be careful not to make this too small if your world size grows or as the time it takes to create backups increases, scheduled backups may overlap. If you keep the default value, this is unlikely to happen unless your world is very large and/or your internet is very slow. |
| `MANUAL` | Typing in the `backup` command causes one of these backups to be created. |
|`ON_STOP`| One of these backups is created every time the server is gracefully stopped using the `stop` command |
|`ON_FORCED_STOP`| If the server is killed ungracefully, it will try to create one of these types of backups. This is more like a 'last resort' that may also help with debugging. These backups are very sketchy and due to the nature of forced stops they could be incomplete, corrupted, or not uploaded to Amazon S3 properly. |

### Remote Backups

Whenever a backup is created, if `use-aws-s3-backup` is set to true, the software uploads (or in the case of `ON_FORCED_STOP` backups, attempts to upload) the backup to an Amazon S3 bucket for the account you set up.

### Restoring backups

Whenever the server starts, if `use-aws-s3-backup` is set to true, the latest backups according to creation time will be retrieved from Amazon S3 and added to the directory of local backups. After that, the latest backup that is not of the type `ON_FORCED_STOP` will be used to replace the state of the world on the server before starting the server. (so non backed up data will be lost) If the server is always shut down correctly, then this backup will always of the type `ON_STOP`.

**Warning: It's a good idea to make sure your computer's time is synced and consistent so the correct backups are always retrieved and restored**

If you want to restore a specific backup to the server when it is running, you can use the `force-restore <BACKUP_FILE_NAME>` command, which will create a separate backup of the current server state, gracefully stop the server, restore the backup you specified, and restart the server. You can also do this from the UI pretty easily.

This is also useful if you want to import your existing world into the server. Just make sure your level name matches the one in your config and create a zip file with your level (a folder matching the level name) at the root. Then name your zip file something you'll recognize, drop it into the `backups` folder and restore it either from the UI or the terminal. If you're unsure about the format, you can look at some of the backups the server creates on its own.

### Automatic purging of old backups

For both local, and remote backups, the software only keeps a limited number of backups, deleting the oldest ones once new ones are created. How many backups to keep is determined on a per type basis based on the values in `num-backups-to-keep-for-type`. Setting one of these values to `-1` means old backups of that type will never be deleted.

## Known issues
### Still in alpha

Mojang's server software, which this software uses, is still in alpha, so it could be buggy. One of my motivations for writing this software was so that the automatic backups could protect me from losing information due to bugs in the alpha server software. It's worked great for me and my friends so far, but as always, please be somewhat careful.

### ~~Windows incompatibilities~~ (Seemingly fixed)
~~The software currently only supports Ubuntu 18.04+ as of now, though a Windows 10 version of Mojang's server software does exist. This is because there is [an issue with the last version I checked that prevents backups from being effectively created](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-2733). This is kind of annoying since it means you can't run the server and connect to it from the same computer, barring virtual machines (Minecraft Bedrock Edition is available on Windows 10 but not Ubuntu). If the backup issue is fixed, and I get the time, lmk and I will add Windows 10 support so you don't need the extra machine and OS.~~
This issue seems to have been fixed somewhere around Mojang's server version `1.16.201.02`, and my testing seems fine so I've enabled Windows support in this repo. Lmk if you run into any issues.

### Scaling issues?
I wouldn't recommend using this server to host dozens upon dozens of clients. It might work well given the correct configuration values, hardware, and network bandwidth, but I haven't done any large scale tests, so attempt this at your own peril.

2. Select your build.gradle file and have it import.
3. Run the following command: ""gradlew genIntellijRuns"" (./gradlew genIntellijRuns if you are on Mac/Linux)
4. Refresh the Gradle Project in IDEA if required.

If at any point you are missing libraries in your IDE, or you've run into problems you can run ""gradlew --refresh-dependencies"" to refresh the local cache. ""gradlew clean"" to reset everything {this does not affect your code} and then start the processs again.

475,NYPL/historical-minecraft,Python,"#Historical Maps in Minecraft

*a project by Paul Beaudoin and Leonard Richardson*

As fans of Minecraft, and fans of real-world maps, we took advantage
of [the New York Public Library's huge collection of digitized
maps](http://www.nypl.org/node/80186) to experiment with converting a
historical map to a Minecraft world.

We chose to convert [this 1860 map of the Fort Washington
area](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/baa8b48a-d8d8-1066-e040-e00a180661dc)
into a Minecraft world. It's a topographical map, which means we can
convert it into a three-dimensional space. Most of its features are
features commonly seen in Minecraft--fields, water, dirt and stone
paths. Our experiment lets you virtually explore a nineteenth-century
Manhattan, a space that no longer exists.

We've generated two Minecraft versions of the Fort Washington
map. [The first
map](https://github.com/NYPL/historical-minecraft/tree/master/fort-washington/maps/fort-washington%20map%201)
is a simple creative-mode visualization of the historical map. [The
second
map](https://github.com/NYPL/historical-minecraft/tree/master/fort-washington/maps/fort-washington%20game%201)
turns historic Fort Washington into a Minecraft survival experience,
with valuable resources scattered beneath the ground.

[<img src=""img/rectified-map-ref-thumb.png""/>](img/rectified-map-ref.png)

Converting the map was a three-step process.

 1. Paul traced over the topographical lines on the historical map and
    generated a bitmap image showing the estimated elevation at every
    point on the map. This gave the maximum height (y-coordinate) for
    every (x,z) coordinate in the Minecraft world.

    [<img src=""img/elevation-thumb.png""/>](img/elevation.png)

 2. Paul then traced over the map's major features and generated a
    second bitmap image that color-coded each pixel according to which
    Minecraft block (dirt, grass, cobblestone, etc.) should be exposed
    at that (x,z) coordinate in the Minecraft world.

    [<img src=""img/features-thumb.png""/>](img/features.png)

 3. Leonard wrote a Python script that combines the two bitmap images
    into a three-dimensional Minecraft world.

    [<img src=""img/in-game-thumb.png""/>](img/in-game.png)

##I. Generating the Elevation TIFF

[<img src=""img/elevation-thumb.png""/>](img/elevation.png)

The elevation tiff is a black & white bitmap representing the elevation at each pixel of the map as a value from pure black (0 elevation) to pure white (highest elevation)

###Requirements

QGIS 2.2.0 ( http://qgis.org )
 - Activate Contour plugin
 - Activate GRASS plugin if not already activated 

A map image to work from
 - We used a geo-rectified TIFF exported from [this map](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/maps/16089#Rectify_tab) but any high rez scan of a map with elevation data and features will suffice.

###Process:

Layer > Add Raster Layer > [select rectified tiff]
 - Repeat for each tiff to be analyzed

Layer > New > New Shapefile Layer
 - Type: Point
 - New Attribute: add 'elevation' type whole number
 - remove id

Contour (plugin)
 - Vector Layer: choose points layer just created
 - Data field: elevation
 - Number: at least 20 (maybe.. number of distinct elevations + 2)
 - Layer name: default is fine

Export and import contours as vector layer:
 - right click save (e.g. port-washington-contours.shp)
 - May report error like ""Only 19 of 20 features written."" Doesn't seem to matter much

Layer > Add Vector Layer > [add .shp layer just exported]

Edit Current Grass Region (to reduce rendering time)
 - clip to minimal lat longs

Open Grass Tools
 - Modules List: Select ""v.in.ogr.qgis""
 - Select recently added contours layer
 - Run, View output, and close

Open Grass Tools
 - Modules List: Select ""v.to.rast.attr""
 - Name of input vector map: (layer just generated)
 - Attribute field: elevation
 - Run, View output, and close

Open Grass Tools
 - Modules List: Select ""r.surf.contour""
 - Name of existing raster map containing colors: (layer just generated)
 - Run (will take a while), View output, and close

Hide points and contours (and anything else above bw elevation image)
Project > Save as Image

You may want to create a cropped version of the result to remove un-analyzed/messy edges

##II. Generating the Features TIFF

[<img src=""img/features-thumb.png""/>](img/features.png)

The features tiff represents the roads, paths, stationary water
bodies, running water bodies, and buildings of the map.

###Requirements

Inkscape & imagemagick

###Process
In Inkscape, import the original rectified tiff and the elevation tiff as a reference, making sure one perfectly overlays the other. Import the cropped elevation tiff on top of that and make sure it perfectly matches up with the uncropped elevation tiff behind it. With the cropped elevation tiff selected, do File > Document Properties > Page > Custom Size > Resize page to drawing or selection. This will ensure that when you export from Inkscape, the result is exactly the same size and corresponds pixel-to-pixel with the elevation tiff.

Depending on what features will be identified, set up separate layers for roads, paths, stationary water, streams, and buildings. Proceed to trace the features using the line/bezier tool. ""Path > Stroke to path"" is your friend when tracing creeks and paths with mostly regular widths. Placing features of similar type on independent layers makes it easier to mass assign colors by type. 

Each distinct resource types will be colored differently. In our case we decided that I would indicate the resource type by manipulating the R value of the color:

 - 10 dirt
 - 20 grass
 - 30 cobble
 - 40 stone brick
 - 200 water
 - 210 flowing water

Since G and B were ignored by the map generation code, I was able to manipulate G and B to my liking to create visual distinction when editing. For example, paths were colored RGB(10,228,61,255), which appears lime green, whereas roads were colored RGB(30,143,95,255), which appears dark green.

If there are any transparent areas remaining, set the document background color to whatever tile should be your default (e.g. grass)

Save your SVG. Export to TIFF using imagemagick:

    convert +antialias -depth 8 features.svg features.tif

This should produce a TIFF without anti-aliasing. (The -depth 8 flag converts it from 16 bit, which PIL can't read.) Open the image and zoom to an edge to confirm there are no intermediate color values. See below for rationale and troubleshooting. (If PIL complains when opening the tiff, you may need to open in GIMP and re-save.)

####Anti-Aliasing Troubleshooting

At writing, Inkscape isn't able to suppress anti-aliasing when exporting to raster. Whereas anti-aliasing is almost always a benefit, it's frustrating if you're trying to maintain specific R values. With anti-aliasing, pixels of intermediate value are created at the edges of shapes. For example, at the intersection of dirt and grass, a pixel with R value 15 was common (corresponding to half of 10 + 20). Leonard's python code was modified to round to the nearest accepted value when processing these edge values. Additionally the R values were reassigned to prevent, for example, blocks of water appearing at the intersection of road and grass (i.e. presume rounding errors will occur and ensure they're acceptable accidents).

Several attempts to force SVGs to render without anti-aliasing failed:

1. Reduce color pallette to 6 in GIMP. 
  - This worked, but created a lot of incorrect pixels at intersections.
1. Add crispEdges directives to all shapes:
  - e.g. `sed -i '.orig' 's/style=""[^""]*""/&\'$'\nshape-rendering=""crispEdges""/g' $file > $file~`
  - This was promising, but you're at the mercy of the viewer, and none seemed to respect it.

Ultimately imagemagick with +antialias worked for me. I gather that the success of this method is tied to the SVG renderer built with imagemagick. This is what I have:

    convert -list format | grep SVG
     MSVG  SVG       rw+   ImageMagick's own SVG internal renderer
      SVG  SVG       rw+   Scalable Vector Graphics (XML 2.7.3)
     SVGZ  SVG       rw+   Compressed Scalable Vector Graphics (XML 2.7.3)

# III. Building the world

[<img src=""img/in-game-thumb.png""/>](img/in-game.png)

The [script for generating the
worlds](https://github.com/NYPL/historical-minecraft/blob/master/fort-washington/generate_map.py)
uses [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) to load the TIFF
bitmaps into memory, and
[pymclevel](https://github.com/mcedit/pymclevel) to generate a
Minecraft worlds, one block at a time. It's run successfully on both
Mac OS X and Linux.

The script starts by calculating how large the world needs to be. It
scales down the elevation bitmap so that a height of 0 on the bitmap
corresponds to a height of 12 on the Minecraft map. (This avoids
problems with void fog.)

Then, the script generates the world and enough chunks to hold the
map. It creates a wall of glass around the map area. It then generates
a pillar of stone at every (x,z) coordinate covered by the map. The
height of each pillar is controlled by the elevation bitmap, and the
block at the top of each pillar is controlled by the feature bitmap.

The world is a ""superflat""-type world whose terrain consists entirely
of air blocks. This ensures that venturing outside the glass-encosed
map area will not cause Minecraft to generate new terrain.

To avoid discolored grass, the biome of every (x,z) coordinate on the
map is set to Plains (for a survival-mode map) or to Ocean (for a
creative-mode map).

476,simon816/Command-Block-Assembly,Python,"Command Block Assembly
======================

Command Block Assembly started off as a tool that compiled assembly instructions
into Minecraft commands.

It has now grown into a much larger suite of tools for compiling source code into Minecraft
commands, therefore the toolchain as a whole is known as the Minecraft Compiler Collection (MCC).


Minecraft Compiler Collection
=============================

The Minecraft Compiler Collection (MCC) is an umbrella tool composed of multiple compilers in a toolchain to
compile high level code into Minecraft commands. It shares some similarities with the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

MCC is composed of the following components:

## CBL Compiler

Command Block Language (CBL) is a C++ inspired programming language specifically designed for Minecraft commands.

CBL has been designed to abstract away from commands to the point where you don't need to consider the underlying mechanics.

The syntax is similar to C++ in a lot of ways. It also takes from Java's idea of having no pointers in the language.

### Example

```cpp
include ""Text""

type point {
    int x;
    int y;

    constructor(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    inline point operator +(point other) {
        return point(this.x + other.x, this.y + other.y);
    }

    inline point operator *(int val) {
        return point(this.x * val, this.y * val);
    }

    inline void print();
}

inline void point::print() {
    Text output;
    output += ""("";
    output.append_ref(this.x);
    output += "", "";
    output.append_ref(this.y);
    output += "")"";
    output.send_to_all();
}

void main() {
    point p1(2, 4);
    point p2(5, 9);
    p1 += p2;
    p1 *= 2;
    p1.print();
}
```

This example demonstrates several language features of CBL, some of which should be familiar to C++ programmers.

Because everything in this example can be determined statically (at compile time), the output is just:

```mcfunction
tellraw @a [{""text"":""(""},{""text"":""14""},{""text"":"", ""},{""text"":""26""},{""text"":"")""}]
```

### Documentation

See the [CBL Wiki](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/wiki/CBL) for more details on the CBL language.

## Assembler

The assembler in MCC is the original assembler when this project was just Command Block Assembly.

### Assembly Language

The assembly language is simple and has instructions similar to x86.

The language looks like the following:

```asm
#include foo.asm

; Useful comment

.my_const #1 ; A constant value
.my_ref my_const ; A constant reference

main:
    MOV #0x01, 0 ; Do the thing
    _loop: ADD my_const, 0
    JMP _loop
```

### Example

The first example code written for CBA was an assembly program that prints the fibinacci sequence until
the next value overflows:

```asm
.x 0x00
.y 0x01
.old_x 0x02
.counter 0x03

main:
    MOV #0, x
    MOV #1, y
    MOV #1, counter
    _loop:
    PRINT ""fib("", counter, "") = "", x
    SYNC
    ADD #1, counter
    MOV x, old_x
    MOV y, x
    ADD old_x, y
    CMP #0, x
    JGE _loop ; if not >=0 then x has overflowed
```

### Documentation

The instruction set and how write CBA programs is documented [on the wiki](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/wiki/Assembly-Language).

## C Compiler

MCC partially implements a C compiler, most language features are implemented and it includes a preprocessor.

The C compiler sits on top of the assembler - all C code is compiled into assembly which is then passed through MCC's assembler.

### Example

Here is the same fibinacci sequence program but implemented in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int x;
int y;
int old_x;
int counter;

void main() {
    x = 0;
    y = 1;
    counter = 1;
    do {
        printf(""fib(%d) = %d"", counter++, x);
        sync;
        old_x = x;
        x = y;
        y += old_x;
    } while(x >= 0);
}
```

### Documentation

The C compiler tries to stay as close as possible to the real C language, so documentation for most language features can be found elsewhere.


There is only one built-in type, `int`. Fundamentally, all data is stored in a scoreboard objective
which is a 32 bit signed integer.


The [mclib.h](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/blob/master/c_comp/include/mclib.h) file
contains several useful macros and definitions.


Browse the code in the [examples](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/tree/master/examples) directory to see working examples
of C code.


## Command IR Compiler

Command IR is _the_ intermediate representation used by MCC. All compilers above ultimately generate Command IR code.

It is designed to relate closely to Minecraft commands themselves but provide a level of abstraction and context which
enables optimizations among other things.

Command IR supports linking, which means it's possible to write code in CBL, C, ASM and IR directly and compile them
together into one program.

### Example

Here is a hello world program:
```
function hello {
    preamble {
        $all_players = selector a
        $message = text
        extern
    }

    compiletime {
        entry:
        text_append $message, ""Hello, ""
        text_append $message, ""World!""
    }

    begin:
    text_send $message, $all_players
    ret
}
```

The output is a file `hello.mcfunction`:
```mcfunction
tellraw @a [{""text"":""Hello, ""},{""text"":""World!""}]
```

### Documentation

Command IR's syntax, instruction reference and internal working is documented [on the wiki](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/wiki/Command-IR).

## Datapack Packer

Finally, to bring everything together and generate a [datapack](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack), MCC reads a ""Datapack Definition"" file
which declares how to package the code into a datapack.

The file is a simple INI file declaring attributes such as the namespace.

To complete the fibinacci example, the datapack definition file [`fib.dpd`](https://github.com/simon816/Command-Block-Assembly/blob/master/examples/fib.dpd) is:
```ini
[Datapack]
namespace=fib
place location=0 56 0
description = An example datapack that prints the fibonacci sequence
```

### Documentation

Currently there is only one section in a DPD file, the **Datapack** section.

In order to create a datapack, two values are required: the `namespace` and the `place location`

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|namespace|The [namespace](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Namespaced_ID) used for functions in the datapack|
|place location|An absolute position in the world to place the utility command block. Specifiy as 3 space-separated numbers|
|spawn location|A position in the world to spawn the global armorstand. Specifiy as 3 space-separated components. Relative positioning (~) is allowed|
|description|Set the description of the datapack|
|generate cleanup|Generate a function which will remove everything created by the datapack|

# MCC pipeline

There are 3 main stages to the compiler pipeline:
1) Compiling: Converts source code into Command IR
2) Linking: Merges one or more Command IR files into one master file
3) Packing: Converts Command IR into Minecraft commands and creates a datapack from a datapack definition file

The MCC command takes a list of files, each code file goes through some number of transformations to end up as a Command IR object.

The linker merges each Command IR object into a single Command IR object. Any conflicts when merging will abort the compiler.

A datapack definition file is required for the packer. The packer takes the single Command IR object and generates the final
mcfunction files.

To get an idea of the hierarchy of components, here is a diagram:

```
            +---------------+
            |               |
            |  C Compiler   |
            |               |
+-----------+---------------+
|           |               |
|    CBL    |   Assembler   |
|           |               |

|        Command IR         |
|                           |
+---------------------------+----+
|                                |
|      Command Abstraction       |       +--------------+
+--------------------------------+-------|   Datapack   |
|          Minecraft Commands            |  Definition  |
+----------------------------------------+--------------+
|                           Datapack                    |
+-------------------------------------------------------+

```

# Running MCC

You will need to generate the standalone parsers (from [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark)) using the `./build-parsers.sh` script.
If on Windows, run the `python` commands in that script from the root of this project.

The Lark python package needs to be installed, `pip` can be used on the `requirements.txt` file. It is recommended to use `virtualenv`.

Example: `virtualenv env --python=python3 && source env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
Once the parsers have been built, you don't technically need the virtual environment anymore. It can be deleted with
`deactivate && rm -rf env/`

Alternatively, you don't need to create the standalone parsers if you keep Lark available in the python environment.

MCC is implemented in python. Currently it is not bundled into an executable so it must be invoked using the python interpreter.

MCC is invoked by `python mcc.py` (If python 3 is not your default python command then run `python3 mcc.py`).

Command help text:
```
usage: mcc.py [-h] [-o outfile] [-E] [-c] [-S] [-dump-asm] [-O {0,1}]

Output generation control:
  Options that control what stage in the output pipeline the compiler should
  stop at.

  -o outfile          Set the filename to write output to.
  -E                  Stop after running the preprocessor. Input files which

                      dynamic linking of datapacks
  --dummy-datapack    Don't write an output datapack. This can be used for
                      debugging with --dump-commands
  --stats             Print statistics about the generated datapack
  --dump-commands     Dump the commands to stdout as they are written to the
                      datapack
  --c-page-size SIZE  Size of the memory page to generate if using the C
                      compiler
```

MCC will dispatch a different tool depending on what the file extension of each input file is:

 * `.cbl` Will compile the CBL source code file
 * `.c` Will compile the C source code file
 * `.asm` Will compile the assembly file
 * `.ir` Will read the Command IR file
 * `.o` Will load the pre-compiled Command IR object file
 * `.dpd` Will read the datapack definition file

Depending on the command line arguments, MCC will perform different tasks on each file. Some files
are ignored if they are not relevant for the desired action.

## Examples

Compiling `examples/fib.asm` into a datapack `fib.zip`:
```
python mcc.py examples/fib.asm examples/fib.dpd
```

Compiling `examples/hdd_driver.c` into Command IR `examples/hdd_driver.ir`:
```
python mcc.py examples/hdd_driver.c -S

# Build
1. Install CMake 3.14, C++ compiler, OpenGL.

>Windows: VS2019 and workload Desktop development with C++

>Ubuntu: `apt install cmake g++ libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev`

>MacOS: `xcode-select --install` and install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)

2. Build AltCraft using CMake (run in directory with clonned AltCraft repo):
```
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build .
```

>Windows: Just `Clone a repository` on statup screen in VS2019.

>Linux and MacOS: Alternatively, you could build and run using IDE such as CLion.

>Linux: There is a problem that Optick does not compile, so for now it needs to be disabled via the additional CMake parameter `-DOPTICK_ENABLED=OFF`.
3. Copy *.minecraft/version/{version}/{version}.jar/assets/* to *AltCraft-root/cwd/*
>You can extract .jar file as .zip archive.

>*/cwd/assets/minecraft/models/block/block.json* must be a valid path.
4. Set /cwd/ as working directory and run AC: `cd ../cwd/ && ../build/AltCraft`

479,iPortalTeam/ImmersivePortalsMod,Java,"# Immersive Portals Mod

It's a Minecraft mod that provides see-through portals and seamless teleportation. It also can create ""Non-Euclidean"" (Uneuclidean) space effect.

![immptl.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/09/30/chHMG45dsnZNqep.png)

[On CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-portals-mod)     [On Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersiveportals)     [Website](https://qouteall.fun/immptl/)

This mod changes a lot of underlying Minecraft mechanics. This mod allows the client to load multiple dimensions at the same time and synchronize remote world information(blocks/entities) to client. It can render portal-in-portals. The portal rendering is roughly compatible with some versions of Sodium and Iris. The portal can transform player scale and gravity direction.  [Implementation Details](https://qouteall.fun/immptl/wiki/Implementation-Details)

(This is the Fabric version of Immersive Portals. [The Forge version](https://github.com/iPortalTeam/ImmersivePortalsModForForge))

## API

This mod also provides some API for:

* Manage see-through portals
* Dynamically add dimensions
* Synchronize remote chunks to client
* Render the world into GUI
* Other utilities

482,Twister915/mcproto-rs,Rust,"# mcproto-rs

This is an implementation of serialization and deserialization of the minecraft protocol.

This crate can be used to implement any version of the minecraft protocol, and has an example implementation of version 
1.15.2 included as module `v1_15_2`.

To implement your own protocol, consult this example, and use the macros to define a protocol to your heart's content!

More documentation to come, just dumping the code since I finished it.

Usage:
```toml
[dependencies]
mcproto-rs = ""0.2.0""
```

## `#![no_std]`

You can use this crate without the standard library (but requiring `alloc`) by setting `default-features = false` in 
your Cargo.toml. This will only disable the `UUID4::random()` function, which requires `OsRandom` to generate a random UUID."

## About
Matter Overdrive is a Minecraft mod inspired by the popular Sci-fi TV series Star Trek. It dwells in the concept of replicating and transforming one type matter into another.
Although it may seem overpowered, Matter Overdrive takes a more realistic approach and requires the player to build a complex system before even the simplest replication can be achieved.

Connect to many different server versions from your Fabric client!

## Social
Discord: https://discord.gg/Jg7Bun7
Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/earthcomputer

## Why another protocol translator?
Multiconnect distinguishes itself from similar projects such as ViaVersion and ProtocolSupport in that it is
very much client-side. Crucially, this means it can (and does) fix many version differences on the client;
such issues are unfixable on the server. As of the time of writing, multiconnect is the only mod which fixes
1.12 swimming mechanics, parkour differences, and re-adds removed features such as command syntax on the client.

On the other hand, multiconnect supports only the latest Minecraft client version, and only on Fabric. It also
does not have as much version coverage as ViaVersion and ProtocolSupport (yet).

### Usage with ViaFabric
If you want to connect to servers older than what multiconnect can currently support, you can install
[ViaFabric](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaFabric) alongside multiconnect, the two are compatible -
multiconnect will translate as much as it can, ViaFabric will take you the rest of the way. Follow the
instructions in the ViaFabric readme for details on how to do this.

### Other alternatives
- [ClientViaVersion](https://github.com/Gerrygames/ClientViaVersion): a discontinued plugin for The 5zig Mod
which supported client versions 1.7.10, 1.8, 1.8.9, 1.12 and 1.12.2.
- [ViaVersion](https://viaversion.com/), [ProtocolSupport](https://protocol.support/): server-side protocol
bridges.

## Installation for Players
1. Download and run the [Fabric installer](https://fabricmc.net/use).
   - Click the ""vanilla"" button, leave the other settings as they are,
     and click ""download installer"".
   - Note: this step may vary if you aren't using the vanilla launcher
     or an old version of Minecraft.
1. Download multiconnect from the [releases page](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/multiconnect/releases)
   and move it to the mods folder (`.minecraft/mods`).

## Build Instructions
1. Building requires JDK17.
2. 
   1. On Windows, run `gradlew build`
   2. On Linux and MacOS, run `./gradlew build`
   3. Note: sometimes, especially on development versions, the tests may fail. To skip the tests, use `./gradlew build -x test`
3. The JAR file can be found in `build/libs` (it's the one with the shortest name).

## Installation for Mod Developers
Looking to support custom payloads? Check out [this document](docs/custom_payloads.md).

This section is for when you are developing your own mod and want to use the multiconnect API, or run multiconnect alongside your mod in the IDE. Aside from the first step, you ONLY need to follow the steps applicable to you and your mod.
1. Explicitly setting a repository is not necessary, as multiconnect is hosted on Maven Central.
1. If you want to use the API inside your mod, you will have to jar-in-jar it for the release and add it to the classpath. To do this, add the following to your `dependencies {}` block:
   ```groovy
   dependencies {
      // ...
      modImplementation('net.earthcomputer.multiconnect:multiconnect-api:<version>') { transitive = false }
      include('net.earthcomputer.multiconnect:multiconnect-api:<version>') { transitive = false }
   }
   ```
   - Note: replace `<version>` with the version of multiconnect you want to depend on.
   - Note: SKIP the `include` part if your mod is NOT using the API in any way.
1. If you want to run multiconnect in the IDE alongside your mod, add the following to your `dependencies {}` block:
   ```groovy
   dependencies {
      // ...
      modRuntimeOnly('net.earthcomputer.multiconnect:multiconnect-slim:<version>') { transitive = false }
   }
   ```
   - Note: the previous step should also be done alongside this step.
   - Note: this step is only necessary if you want to run the full mod in the IDE. Otherwise you can skip this step.

488,kbsriram/mcpiapi,Python,"#Minecraft Pi API mod

This is a [Minecraft Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Universal) mod that reimplements (a subset of) the Minecraft Pi edition API.

The Minecraft Pi Edition also contains a [simple to use API](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft.html). My plugin recreates this simple API in your desktop Minecraft, so you can now program your Desktop edition Minecraft easily using the Pi API.

##Screenshots

![Sokoban](../master/downloads/sokoban.jpg?raw=true)

I've added an in-game command `/python` which calls an `mcpi` python script you place in a special directory. [This example](mcpimods/python/clear.py) clears a cubiod of blocks in front of you.

![Clear a cuboid of blocks](../master/downloads/clear_mod.gif?raw=true)

##Installing

This plugin works with the 1.7.10 version of Minecraft.

If you haven't installed Minecraft Forge, take a look at the
[installation instructions for
Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Universal).

Once you've successfully installed Minecraft Forge, [download
the jar file](../master/downloads/McpiApiMod-1.7.10-1.0.jar) to
your `minecraft/mods` folder.

If you've already programmed the Pi edition with one of the client
libraries - the plugin starts up on the same port (4711) so your
code should work unchanged.

If you're new to programming the Pi API - Martin O'Hanlon has a nice
[introductory series of
articles](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft.html) that should
get you started.

I've included the python version of the Pi Edition client library and a few demos under the [`mcpimods/python`](mcpimods/python) directory. It adds support for some additional commands supported by the mod - but the mod should also work against the standard Pi edition client library.

To get the standard Pi Edition client library - download [the free Minecraft Pi
Edition](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.minecraft.net/pi/minecraft-pi-0.1.1.tar.gz)
and you should find java and python clients, as well as a few demos
under its `mcpi/api` directory.

Not all the commands from the standard client are implemented, and
I've probably botched up the right way to do many things -- this was
my first foray into writing a forge plugin. But I hope you find it
useful and fun nevertheless.

Functionally, this mod is similar to the [RaspberryJuice
plugin](https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice). However,
RasperryJuice runs on a Bukkit server, whereas this mod runs under any
client running Minecraft Forge.

##Enhancements

The forge mod tries to be compatible with the extended commands
supported by the [RaspberryJuice
plugin](https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice).

I've also added an in-game command `/python` which calls scripts you
place under a directory called `mcpimods/python` in your root
Minecraft installation.

The `mcpimods/` directory should be next to your Forge `mod/`
directory. For example, if (on a Mac) your Forge mod directory looks
like `Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods/`, you would place
your python scripts under `Library/Application
Support/minecraft/mcpimods/python`

From within the game, you simply call the name of your script (without
the `.py` extension) and it will launch the python script as an
external process.

This is best suited for running short commands rather than something
that runs in an infinite loop; but of course I hope you experiment and
find interesting things.

I've [bundled the python mcpi library](mcpimods/python) which has a
small demo client that [clears a cuboid of
blocks](mcpimods/python/clear.py). You should also be able to copy the
[`mcpimods`](mcpimods) directory to the root of your minecraft
installation and start using the `/python` in-game command from the
mod.

I've added some experimental commands:

`world.setTileEntityHex(x,y,z,hex)`, which takes an `x,y,z` position
relative to the spawn point, and an ASCII hex string representing a
tile entity in [NBT format](http://wiki.vg/NBT). The main purpose
was to have some (weak) support for importing schematic files, and you
can see [an experimental script](mcpimods/python/load.py) that tries to
load schematic files. It doesn't always do the right thing, but it's good enough to have some fun creating structures from [schematic files](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Schematic_file_format)

Reading an [autofarm schematic](http://www.minecraft-schematics.com/schematic/934/) via the in-game `/python` command.
![Reading a schematic](../master/downloads/load_mod.gif?raw=true)


`events.block.wait.hit()` waits until a block is hit, and returns the
`x,y,z` position of the block. This can be useful to avoid busy wait
loops from your code.

`events.entity.wait.movedTile()` waits until a player has moved
their tile position, and reports a `,` separated string like
`entityid,x,y,z`. The `x,y,z` position is the current tile position of
the player with `entityid`. This too is handy to avoid busy wait loops
in your code. Check out [this example](mcpimods/python/follow.py) for
a hello world type script for how to use this command.

`events.setting(key,value)` to configure events. Currently, just one
key is available -- `restrict_to_sword` and it takes `0` or `1` as its
boolean value. `events.setting(restrict_to_sword,0)` will remove the
(default) check that reports block hit events only when the player is
also holding a sword.

-----

Minecraft X-Ray is a program whose primary purpose is to aid in finding
valuable ores and resources inside a Minecraft world. By default, when you
select a resource type to highlight, X-Ray will cause any blocks of that
type to visibly glow within the range of loaded chunks. The glowing can
sometimes be a bit much, so you can also toggle the glowing on/off, which
will still leave all instances of the selected resource visible on the
screen.

Additionally, X-Ray is somewhat useful for taking a look at natural
underground caves, to find out how extensive they are, or even to help
find your way out if you're lost.

The original author of Minecraft X-Ray was plusminus, who was kind enough
to provide the sourcecode for that excellent application.

Minecraft X-Ray is released under the Modified BSD License.
See COPYING.txt for more information, and Changelog.txt for a complete
list of changes since X-Ray 2.7.  X-Ray uses various third-party libraries
for other tasks.  See COPYING.txt for details on their licensing, and
COPYING-*.txt for copies of the licenses themselves.

X-Ray includes code kindly provided by Eleazar Vega-Gonzalez and Saxon Parker.
Thanks a bunch!

See TODO.txt for a list of known bugs and things that I'd like to
implement, and BUILDING.txt if you wanted some info on building the project
yourself.

The official website for Minecraft X-Ray is currently:
    http://apocalyptech.com/minecraft-xray/
	
The official forum link is currently:
    http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1022&t=119356
	
Once again, many thanks to plusminus for writing X-Ray in the first place,
and providing the sourcecode so that it could be extended and maintained.

RUNNING
-------

There isn't an installer for this currently.  Perhaps one day...

Windows users should be able to run the program by just doubleclicking on
minecraft_xray.exe or minecraft_xray.bat.

Linux and OSX users should be able to doubleclick on either minecraft_xray.sh
or minecraft_xray_osx.command (the files are actually identical).

KEYS
----

Note that currently the mouse buttons cannot be specified in the properties
file, so those functions are hardcoded.  All keyboard commands can be
overridden, though.  The default keybindings are as follows:

    Movement
        Movement:       WASD
        Fly Upward:     SPACE

EXTRA BLOCK DEFINITIONS
-----------------------

As of version 3.3.0, X-Ray includes a mechanism to allow the user to
define custom block types.  X-Ray will read any block definition file
found inside the ""blockdefs"" directory inside .minecraft_xray.  This
is located at:

    Windows: %appdata%\.minecraft_xray\blockdefs\
    OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft_xray/blockdefs/
    Linux: ~/.minecraft_xray/blockdefs/

Each file must have a "".yaml"" extension, and X-Ray won't read any file
named ""minecraft.yaml"".  It would be best practice to name the file
after the mod you're intending to support, such as ""aether.yaml"".  The
file format is in YAML 1.1.  There should be some very detailed docs
contained inside the global ""minecraft.yaml"" file (you can find this
in X-Ray's own ""blockdefs"" directory, where you unpacked it).  Examples
(and a copy of the global minecraft.yaml file) can be found here:

    http://apocalyptech.com/minecraft-xray/modsupport.php

As mentioned above, X-Ray will automatically attempt to load any YAML
file it finds in the blockdefs directory, and it will display which ones
it was able to load on the opening dialog.  If your file doesn't show up
in the list, there's probably an error in it - you should be able to
find that error in the file minecraft_xray_output_log.txt in the root
X-Ray directory.  Linux and OSX users (and Windows users who use the .BAT
file instead of the .EXE) will see the errors on the console from which
X-Ray was launched, as well.

RENDERING DETAILS
-----------------

There are three main ""sliders"" available to control how things are
rendered: Visibility range, Highlighting range, and Lighting.

Visibility range specifies how many chunks away from the camera the
app will render at any one time.  The minimum is 3, the maximum is 8.

Highlighting range specifies how many chunks away from the camera the
app will highlight/glow the selected resources that you're looking for.
Often (with more common resources) you'll want to keep this value very
low.  Otherwise it becomes quite difficult to tell where you're actually
going.  For less common resources (like pumpkins or clay), you'll want
to have it set as high as possible, though.  Note that this will never
be able to highlight ores outside the set visibility range.

Lighting just determines the OpenGL ""fog"" value.  This is useful to have
a better sense of scale while moving around.  You can toggle into
""fullbright"" mode with F, which will disable the fog entirely.

In addition to the sliders, there are a few toggles which let you set
whether to always draw water and bedrock.  Water is on by default, and
bedrock is off by default (though it will of course show up if necessary,
regardless of this setting).

The ore highlighting glow can be toggled using the ""H"" key.  This will
cycle between the three states of ore highlighting glow.  The default is a
rainbow effect which one user has described as ""disco.""  The next selection
is a plain white highlighting which was the default until version 3.4.0.
Finally, the glow will be turned off entirely.  Note that with the glow
turned off, every instance of the specified ore will still be rendered
onscreen, so this toggle is still quite useful for tracking down ores.

The ""explored"" area toggle, basically just tints any blocks around torches with
a green color.  This makes it very easy to see where you've explored in
underground caves (and is fairly useless above ground).  It does this in a
7x7x7 cube centered around the torches, so the highlighting can easily ""bleed
over"" into adjacent tunnels where you might not have actually explored, but
it's usually very easy to tell when that's happened.

The toggle for grass sides will let you toggle the accurate grass sides
on or off.  Until version 3.2.0, Minecraft X-Ray drew grass as a solid block
of green, which I found occasionally handy while hollowing out mountains
and the like, to know where I could still dig out and where I was right up
against the edge.  X-Ray will now default to the more-accurate rendering,
but you can toggle back and forth with the ""G"" key.

Minecraft Beta 1.9 changed the way fences work slightly, so that they will
""connect"" up to adjacent solid blocks.  X-Ray will now, by default, render
fences that way, but you can toggle it with the ""C"" key, in case you're
viewing pre-1.9 maps.

By default, X-Ray will highlight Silverfish blocks with a red tint.  You can
toggle this on and off with the ""V"" key.

The ""U"" key can be used to toggle the rendering of chunk borders.  This will
draw a transparent box around the chunk the camera is currently in, so it's
easy to see what's inside your current chunk and what isn't.

The ""Slime Chunk"" option will turn on the highlighting of chunks which
should be able to spawn Slimes.  The highlighting will actually only occur
on the bottom part of the map, where the slimes themselves are actually
capable of spawning.  The equation used to calculate this was taken from
http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Slime#Spawning in early October, 2011,
when Beta 1.9-pre2 was out.  The equation may or may not be valid for
earlier or later versions of Minecraft, but should be at least valid
for Minecraft Beta 1.6 through Minecraft 1.0.  The default key to toggle
this highlighting is ""M"".  Note that in Minecraft versions prior to
Beta 1.9-pre5, slimes would spawn only under y=16, whereas from that point
on, slimes will spawn under y=40.  X-Ray will highlight up to y=40 for
all maps.

A sphere with mostly-arbitrary radius can be drawn on the map, which might
be helpful for planning out mob grinders or the like.  To toggle the sphere
on or off, use the forward slash key - it will default to centering around
the current camera position the first time, but remain at that point until
overridden.  To set a new sphere center, use the semicolon key.  The sphere
will start out with a radius of 24.  You can increase or decrease the radius
in 8-block increments using ""comma"" and ""period,"" within the bounds of 8
blocks and 128 blocks.  The sphere itself will be a bluish tone, and the
center will be marked with a small reddish sphere.  X-Ray will remember your
sphere settings for the last world in which you've enabled the sphere.

The rendering information popup can be toggled with ""R"" and is on by
default.  This will let you know what these various settings are set to.

CAMERA OPTIONS
--------------

For singleplayer worlds, there will be two camera presets: the spawnpoint,
and the location of the player.  In this case, INS/DEL isn't really any
different than using HOME/END to jump directly to those presets.  If you
use X-Ray to load a multiplayer world, though, there will also be a camera
preset for each multiplayer user discovered in the world folder, which you
can then cycle through using INS/DEL.  If you've imported a multiplayer
map into singleplayer, the app should create presets for the singleplayer
character AND any multiplayer users still found in the ""players"" directory.

If your world contains a Nether subdirectory, you can warp back and forth
between them with the ""N"" key.  The app will attempt to automatically
translate your position based on where you'd go if you had just used a
portal, though this should only be considered a rough estimate.  Note that
especially when in the Nether, it's possible to warp back to the Overworld
at a location where there isn't actually any map data.  Eventually I'll
try to check for this and make sure that you don't warp outside of the
map, but for now just use the camera presets to get back into known
territory if that happens to you.

By default, if you move forward, X-Ray will move directly towards the point
you're looking at, including up/down.  If you want to ""lock"" the camera to
the vertical axis, you can do so with ""L,"" at which time moving forward/back
will only move the camera horizontally.  You can still move the camera up
and down manually, of course.

OVERRIDING TEXTURES
-------------------

In general, X-Ray will attempt to use the same texture pack that Minecraft is
using, but there may be some circumstances where you want X-Ray to use a
particular texture.

X-Ray will look in four locations for the texture information to load, in this
order:

  1) Inside the following directory, as an override:

        Windows: %appdata%\.minecraft_xray\textures\
        OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft_xray/textures/
        Linux: ~/.minecraft_xray/textures/

  2) From the texture pack that Minecraft itself is set to use.

  3) From Minecraft's builtin texture pack. This could be a custom texture pack
     if you've patched the Minecraft JAR file directly with a texture pack,
     rather than using Minecraft's builtin texture-loading mechanisms

  4) From a bundled, built-in texturepack included with X-Ray itself.  This
     method should theoretically never fail, unless the X-Ray install directory
     has been modified.

The override texture directory mirrors the internal structure of the
texturepacks, but should not be a zipfile. Right now there are four files
that X-Ray could end up reading from this directory:

    terrain.png
    particles.png (for the ""fire"" texture)
    misc/water.png
    art/kz.png (this is the Paintings texture file)

So, rather than packing those inside a zipfile, just put them inside the
""textures"" directory and restart X-Ray, if you wanted to manually override a
texture.

Note that this *will* work for files specified in custom block definition
files (as described above).  For instance, if you're using Aethermod and want
to override the ""Icestone.png"" file, you'd put your own Icestone.png file into
.minecraft_xray/textures/aether/blocks/Icestone.png.

PROPERTIES FILE
---------------

X-Ray keeps a properties file at the following location, essentially right alongside
the "".minecraft"" directory that Minecraft itself uses:

    Windows: %appdata%\.minecraft_xray\xray.properties
    OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/.minecraft_xray/xray.properties
    Linux: ~/.minecraft_xray/xray.properties 

As of X-Ray 3.5.0, all settings in this file can be set using the GUI, so there
shouldn't be any reason to edit it by hand.  If you do want to edit it by hand,
though, feel free - it's just a text file.

This is an archive, for the most recent version look here : https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed

A shaders compatible minecraft texture pack, based on vanilla but with normals and proper glossiness information.
This version (renewed) is made for PBR, but still a WORK IN PROGRESS, so you may encounter some textures with strange behavior.

**⚠️ THIS VERSION IS NOT COMPATIBLE FOR MINECRAFT 1.13 AND ABOVE ⚠️**

## Description

I didn't want any of those fancy high-resolution texture packs in order to enjoy normal mapping and specular highlights.
So I decided to make my own, but based on vanilla textures.

This texture pack is free for everyone to use! However if you wish to support me, you can join my Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/Poudingue

## Copyright


You can do whatever you want with my texture pack, screenshots, videos, modifications for personal use or redistribution, as long as you don't sell it and provide a link to this page or my Patreon. Oh, and also, don't mix it with Realistico. Dead serious.

## Screenshots

⚠️ The screenshots provided here were made using SEUS renewed v1.0, the results will differ with other shaders ⚠️

Textures have bump mapping information, allowing parallax occlusion mapping and normal mapping.
Smoothness information is very important for the credibility of materials too, especially when the sun lights it at grazing angles.

![Normals and smoothness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18035775/34640565-eb2fc134-f2f4-11e7-9d06-c615fb50aed1.png)

Metals and smooth materials now have the correct information to compute reflections.
SEUS renewed heavily relies on Screen Space Reflections for this and don't take correctly roughness surfaces for it, so the reflections may be too shiny and imperfect. However using SEUS PTGI will provide Path-Traced reflections and indirect lighting, and correctly take into account roughness.

![Metal and smooth materials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18035775/34640564-eb1388de-f2f4-11e7-8597-e132e9cde2db.png)

## Installation

- Install a shader supporting normal and specular mapping. If you don't know which one, give this one a shot : https://sonicether.com/seus/ and if you want raytracing, it should also work properly with SEUS PTGI6 : https://www.patreon.com/sonicether

### Old zip Based Method

1. On this page, click on «Clone or download», then «Download as ZIP»
2. Go to the minecraft folder
    - For windows, go to ""%appdata%/.minecraft"" on your start menu.
    - For Linux, go to ""~/.minecraft"" in your file explorer.
    - For Mac OS, go to ""~/Library/Application Support/minecraft"" in your file explorer
3. Go into the resourcepacks folder. Create it if it doesn't exist
4. Extract the file you downloaded here
5. Select the right shader and resourcepack in minecraft options
6. Enjoy !

### NEW GIT powered Install Method

Git is a version control software that github uses to manage all the code that they host, which can be used to make installation really easy.
Version Control software allows multiple authors to collaborate, and track all the changes made, and who made what changes

#### Linux Git Install
    1. To do this, you will first need to open a terminal window
    2. Then verify that git is installed by running `git --version` This will make sure that it is installed, and additionally, show what version is installed
        - If you get an output that looks like `git version 2.21.0` then it is installed.
        - If you get an output like this `bash: git: command not found` (Different shells will appear different, but most will basically state that the command wasn't found.) Different Distros have different approaches to installing software, if you're having trouble look up ""<insert Linux Distro Here> Install git""
    3. Once you have certified git is installed, move your terminal to the folder `~/.minecraft/resourcepacks` by running `cd ~/.minecraft/resourcepacks`
    4. After you're in the right folder, run 'git clone https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed-1.12.git` to clone the entire repository to your computer.
        - You will not need to zip the repo to have it work, Minecraft can handle unzipped texture packs.

##### Linux Git Update
    1. Please have installed the texture pack using the above guide. This won't work if you went on github, downloaded the Zip, and extracted it.
    2. Open up a terminal
    3. Change to the TEXTURE PACK'S folder by running `cd ~/.minecraft/resourcepacks/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed-1.12`
    4. Run `git pull origin' to download the latest version.
        - You might want to relaunch Minecraft after this to make sure it uses the latest textures.


#### Windows Git Install
    1. Install Git and add to the path (don't' worry there is a guide below)
        1. Open a web browser and [download](https://git-scm.com/download/win) the latest version of git
        2. Run the installer
            - When it comes to the ""Adjusting your PATH environment"" the middle option is recommended, as it allow for more flexibility, but doesn't cause problems.
            - When it comes to the ""Configuring the line ending conventions"", set it to ""Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings""
                - Linux and Windows use different line ending in text files, and this will prevent any problems.
            - When it comes to the "" Configuring the Terminal Emulator to use with Git Bash"" the Windows one is sufficient for most work
        3. Once it is installed, launch command prompt
            - Press the Windows key + ""R"", to open a run box, then type in cmd.exe, and press enter
        4. Change to the resourcepack folder using the command  `cd %AppData%/.minecraft/resourcepacks`
        5. Clone the repository to your computer by running git clone https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed-1.12.git
            - You will not need to zip the repo to have it work, Minecraft can handle unzipped texture packs.

##### Windows Git Update
    1. Please have installed the texture pack using the above guide. This won't work if you went on github, downloaded the Zip, and extracted it.
    2. Open up command prompt
        - Press the Windows key + ""R"", to open a run box, then type in cmd.exe, and press enter
    3. Change to the TEXTURE PACK'S folder by running `cd %appdata%/.minecraft/resourcepacks/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed-1.12`
    4. Then run `git pull origin' to download the latest version.
        - You might want to relaunch Minecraft after this to make sure it uses the latest textures.            

## Known Bugs (on SEUS PTGI E6)
- Double doors do not correctly take into account direction of light (for the second door)
- Parallax and normals behaves strangely on rotated textures (rails, for example)
- Insufficiently smooth metals do not look like metals if full raytrace reflections is not active. (This is what causes stripes on iron blocks)
- ???

## What is this?

A basic Minecraft Pocket Edition (MCPE) server written in C#. Current goal is to create a server that has enterprise performance for large Minecraft multi-user gaming providers. Current servers handle 10-100 users per instance, the aim with MiNET is to deal with thousands. Priority is also to create interfaces, and to some extend, ready-made implementations of the most basic enterprise game-management features (users, worlds, etc.). With all likelyhood, MiNET will emerge into a Microsoft Cloud ready product.

As part of the project, I also deliver an up-to-date [automatically generated MCPE Protocol Specification](/src/MiNET/MiNET/Net/MCPE%20Protocol%20Documentation.md). This is a synery of that large parts of the communication code being generated using XML and T4 templates.

## Why do this?

This is actually a pet-project - a true father-son project that I do together with my son Oliver 6 years old. He is driving the requirements for this, doing much of prioritization of the order of implementation. He is a great fan of online-MCPE gaming, but still too young to play the ""real deal"". He also lacks the patience and understanding of laggy under-performant servers, and the consequences of that. He is also not a big fan of the kill-style game-modes around, so a sub-project of this is for him to create new kidz-friendly game-modes that we can implement in MiNET. Oliver was the one originally responsible for creating the scope of our project.

And as he really likes to tell his mother these days ""Mom, don't disturb daddy. He is working for me now!"". 6 years old, but I think you get the picture. I know he does.

499,Nan1t/NanoLimbo,Java,"## NanoLimbo

This is lightweight minecraft limbo server, written on Java with Netty.
The main goal of the project is maximum simplicity with a minimum number of sent and processed packets.
This limbo is empty, there are no ability to set schematic building since 
this is not necessary. You can send useful information in chat or BossBar.

No plugins, no logs. The server is fully clear. It only able keep a lot of players while the main server is down.

The general features:
* High performance. The server not saves and not cached any useless (for limbo) data.
* Doesn't spawn threads per player. Uses fixed threads pool.
* Support for **BungeeCord** and **Velocity** info forwarding.
* Support for [BungeeGuard](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/79601/) handshake format.
* Multiple versions support.
* Fully configurable.
* Lightweight. App size around **2MB.**

### Installation

The installation process is simple.

1. Download the latest version of program **[here](https://github.com/Nan1t/NanoLimbo/releases)**
2. Put jar file in the folder you want.
3. Create a start script as you did it for Bukkit or BungeeCord with command like this:
`java -jar NanoLimbo-<version>.jar`
4. The server will create `settings.yml` file. It's a server configuration.
5. Configure it as you want and restart server.

### About player info forwarding

The server supports player info forwarding from the proxy. There are several types of info forwarding:

* `LEGACY` - The **BungeeCord** IP forwarding.
* `MODERN` - **Velocity** native info forwarding type.
* `BUNGEE_GUARD` - **BungeeGuard** forwarding type.

If you use BungeeCord, or Velocity with `LEGACY` forwarding, just set this type in the config.  
If you use Velocity with `MODERN` info forwarding, set this type and paste secret key from Velocity 
config into `secret` field.
If you installed BungeeGuard on your proxy, then use `BUNGEE_GUARD` forwarding type. 
Then add your tokens to `tokens` list.

### Contributing

You can create pull request, if you found some bug, optimization ability, or you want to add some functional, 
which is suitable for limbo server and won't significantly load the server.

### Building

Required software:

* JDK 1.8+
* Gradle 7+

To build minimized .jar, go to project root and write in terminal:

```
./gradlew shadowJar
```
